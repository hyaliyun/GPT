Write a title: Reuters - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , theworld's biggest retailer, on Tuesday raised its profit forecastfor the full year.","completion":"Title: \\"Reuters - World's Biggest Retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Upgrades Its Full-Year Profit Forecast on Tuesday\\" Long Answer: Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the undisputed leader in global retail, announced on Tuesday that it has increased its profit forecast for the entire fiscal year, further cementing its position at the top of the retail industry. This noteworthy development has piqued the interest of investors and market analysts who have been closely monitoring the retail giant's financial performance, particularly in light of the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ever-evolving consumer preferences. The upgraded profit forecast is a testament to Wal-Mart's continued dedication to delivering consistently impressive financial results in a time when many other retailers are struggling to cope with the unprecedented challenges posed by the global health crisis. The retailer has managed to stay ahead of its competitors through a variety of innovative strategies, such as improving its digital presence, expanding its e-commerce capabilities, and implementing measures to enhance overall customer experience. Among the key factors contributing to Wal-Mart's positive trajectory is the remarkable growth of its online business. The company has been rapidly scaling up its e-commerce operations, investing heavily in new technologies, supply chain improvements, and acquisitions to meet the demand of a new breed of digital-savvy consumers. Additionally, it has been active in forging strategic partnerships with other major players in the market, such as its recent alliances with Shopify and the acquisition of Jet.com, to further extend its online reach. Another critical area where Wal-Mart has demonstrated a competitive advantage is its ability to adapt to the current climate of cautious consumer spending. It has successfully catered to the growing demand for essential products and services during the pandemic by making targeted adjustments to its product assortment and supply chain. Furthermore, the company's prompt response in implementing safety measures across its store locations has helped to foster a sense of trust and loyalty among shoppers in these uncertain times. Besides these innovative approaches, Wal-Mart's overall financial strength has been underpinned by its commitment to cost-saving initiatives and operational efficiency. The company has been diligent in evaluating its store portfolio, shuttering poorly performing stores, and relocating resources to high-potential markets. Moreover, it has been exploring various sources of additional revenue and profit, such as optimizing advertisement placements and enhancing in-store services. In conclusion, Wal-Mart's decision to raise its full-year profit forecast is a strong indicator of the corporation's resilience and adaptability in the face of the ever-changing retail landscape. Its focus on e-commerce, strategic partnerships, product assortment adjustments, and cost-saving measures has positioned the company for continued success in the foreseeable future. As the market continues to evolve in response to global challenges and shifting consumer behaviors, investors and market analysts can expect Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to remain at the forefront of the retail industry, setting the benchmark for other players to follow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Originally introduced by PepsiCo in 1999, it was eventually made available in all United States markets by 2003. The drink was rebranded as Mist Twst in 2016, although it reverted to Sierra Mist in 2018. The brand is aimed at competing with The Coca-Cola Company's Sprite brand and Dr Pepper Snapple Group's 7 Up. is sierra mist and mist twist the same?","completion":"Yes, Sierra Mist and Mist Twst are essentially the same product. However, the rebrand from Sierra Mist to Mist Twst in 2016 was more than just a name change. It also involved slight changes to the drink's ingredients and flavor profile. When Sierra Mist was introduced in 1999 by PepsiCo, it was made as a clear, caffeine-free, lemon-lime flavored soft drink and a direct competitor to Sprite and 7 Up. It was originally sweetened with high fructose corn syrup. In 2010, PepsiCo replaced this with a blend of natural sugar and stevia in an attempt to create a more 'natural' version of the product, and rebranded it as Sierra Mist Natural. However, high fructose corn syrup was reintroduced in 2013 when the drink was rebranded back to simply Sierra Mist. In 2016, the beverage went through another major change. This time Sierra Mist was rebranded as Mist Twst. The new branding was accompanied by a slight change in recipe once again. While Sierra Mist was marketed as a lemon-lime soda, Mist Twst added a hint of cherry flavor to the mix. It also returned to using high fructose corn syrup as a sweetener. This did not last long, as in 2018, PepsiCo again decided to revert back to the original Sierra Mist brand and formula, bringing back the familiar lemon-lime taste without the cherry flavoring. The various changes in formula and branding were made in attempts to differentiate the product in the market and to meet changing consumer preferences. But the core concept of a lemon-lime flavored soda has remained consistent, making Sierra Mist and Mist Twst fundamentally the same product despite the differences in name and slight variations in formulation over the years. However, consumer reception to each of these changes varied, with some preferring the original Sierra Mist formula and others enjoying the changes introduced with Mist Twst."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

So far there's been punctured talk of pacts, \\"blonde\\" bombshell bickering and a promotional \\"printing error\\", but little in the way of significant substance. Maybe it's due to election fatigue on the part of both the prospective politicians and the public after a volley of votes in the past few years. This year, of course, was scheduled to be election-free, but nothing generally goes to plan in the political business. And there's still the chance of another Northern Ireland Assembly poll in the second half of 2017, should Stormont's summer talks stutter. Back in March, a lunchtime trip to Belfast's Electoral Office on the final day of voter registration revealed a line of eager electors snaked all the way down the stairwell and out on to the street. There was no queue when we visited on Monday - the final day for anyone hoping to register for the general election - but there was certainly a steady stream of people dropping off their forms. Along with those updating their records with new addresses, for example, there were more than a few people putting their name down for the first time. Among them was William Thompson. Too young to cast a ballot in March's assembly election, he said he was glad of the chance this time around. \\"The vote in my area was very close last time, so I do think it'll make a difference where I live,\\" said the 18-year-old. \\"I can see some people's disillusion with voting - this is the third big vote in a year, with Brexit, the assembly and the general election.\\" William is doing his A-Levels and said the lack of an online service to register was a hindrance to him. \\"I left this to the last moment because I didn't know where the Electoral Office was. \\"It would be far simpler to do it online, rather than having to fill it in and come down and interrupt study leave.\\" Another student, originally from China, was registering for the first time after living in Northern Ireland for four years. As she is a future junior doctor, healthcare and Brexit are her primary concerns. \\"I saw a thing on Facebook about how young people don't really vote and if you do you can actually sway election results,\\" she said. \\"Politics is complicated - it can be really difficult to understand what's going on. \\"If you don't know what's going on it's really hard to get interested.\\" Another man had recently returned home to Northern Ireland after a long spell of globe-trotting. \\"I have never voted in any election, surprisingly, in all the years I've been eligible to vote,\\" he explained. \\"Whether I choose to in this election I'm as yet unsure - with regards to political processes and politicians, I don't put much faith in them.\\" And he wasn't the only returning traveller - one woman who was back in Belfast after time spent in the Middle East said she wanted to \\"have my say\\" for the first time. \\"It's only in the aftermath of the Brexit vote that I've really been a lot more conscious and a lot more politically engaged,\\" she said. \\"I've been actively seeking out more and more information for myself and forming my own opinions, rather than just accepting what I'm being told.\\" But she's not up for a rerun of the Brexit referendum, as the Liberal Democrats suggest, even though she said last June's result was \\"disappointing\\". \\"I think that you just have to leave it now - everyone will be going around the bend if we have to vote for anything else this year.\\" One disillusioned man in his late-20s was submitting his form after not voting for the past four years. He said: \\"I'm hoping there is a neutral party out there that is thinking 20, 30 years ahead as opposed to 20, 30 years behind.\\" And another had a message for those who chose not to exercise their democratic right at the ballot box. \\"I feel there's more damage to be done by people not making their voices heard,\\" he said. \\"Sure what harm could it do to vote? \\"There's no point crying about how: 'Oh, I don't like how this certain MP got elected.' \\"Well, did you vote against them? If not, you probably conceded your right to complain.\\" If you want to have your say on 8 June but you're not on the electoral register yet, you still have a little bit of time to sort that out.

This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color. A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called grayscale or black-and-white.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. - Pebble Mill Studios was a television studio complex owned by the BBC located in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England. The nine acre site was opened by Princess Anne on 10 November 1971, and in addition to the studios contained two canteens, a post office, gardens, a seven storey office block, and an Outside Broadcasting (OB) base. - Anne Margaret Diamond (born 8 September 1954) is an English radio and television presenter and journalist.

South Korean Ferry Sinking: Following the tragic sinking of a ferry off the coast of South Korea, the high-ranking government official, Prime Minister Chung Hong-won, resigned due to the government's handling of the crisis and public outrage over the event. 2. History Made in the Roman Catholic Church: Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II were declared saints, marking a historic moment for the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Francis described these men as \\"men of courage\\" who \\"shared the Church's vision.\\" 3. Bracing for War in Ukraine: Signs of Ukraine preparing for war include intensified military activity near the border with Russia, military roadblocks, and a significant military buildup. In a nationally televised speech, Ukraine's prime minister accused Russia of orchestrating a war, while President Obama expressed support for the Ukraine government and urged Russia to de-escalate tensions. Russian leaders, on the other hand, accuse Ukraine and the west of \\"orchestrating\\" the crisis. 4. Tornado Alley and Storm Season: Tornado Alley is a region in the central United States with a high propensity for tornado activity. It is located primarily across states such as Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas. Factors that contribute to this heightened tornado activity include the convergence of dry, cold, and warm air masses, which creates unstable atmospheric conditions. Tornado activity in March was less than in previous years, possibly due to colder weather conditions delaying storm season. 5. The 529 College Savings Plan: The purpose of a 529 Savings Plan is to allow families to save for college costs by utilizing tax-advantaged savings accounts. Unlike traditional savings accounts, earnings in a 529 Savings Plan grow tax-free, and withdrawals for educational purposes are not subject to federal income tax. In this edition, the role of news media in storm preparedness is discussed as an essential aspect for communities to stay informed and safe during dangerous weather events. Additionally, the importance of financial planning for education and resources for potential college students is also emphasized."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Updated 11:06 a.m. ET, 12/11/2013 (CNN) - Nelson Mandela's memorial service Tuesday was supposed to be a once-in-a-lifetime event where dozens of world leaders join thousands of South Africans in a massive stadium, all to honor the anti-apartheid icon. Instead, it turned into a media sensation...about a selfie. Halfway through the ceremony, President Barack Obama could be seen helping Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt as the two squeezed in with British Prime Minister David Cameron to take a smiling photo of themselves with a camera-phone Sitting next to them was first lady Michelle Obama, who was clearly not taking part in the photo-op. AFP Photographer Roberto Schmidt, from about 150 meters away, caught the moment. And as soon his photo went public, it went viral. Twitter and Facebook feeds lit up with the photo. News outlets quickly blasted it out online and on television. It all sparked a surging debate: Was the selfie a cute moment, or a tasteless act? \\"Did the President really take a selfie at a funeral? It appears the First Lady did not approve,\\" Republican strategist and conservative firebrand Erick Erickson tweeted early Tuesday. Did the President really take a selfie at a funeral? It appears the First Lady did not approve.— Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) December 10, 2013 Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh spent a portion of show hammering the President for taking part in the selfie and shaking Cuban President Raul Castro's hand at the same event. Obama, Limbaugh argued, was trying to make the memorial service all about himself. \\"He doesn't care, folks,\\" Limbaugh said. \\"This is his stage. I mean, this whole week is about Barack Obama. You understand, that's really what this all means. That's what this soap opera script is. It's not the death of Mandela anymore. This is about Barack Obama assuming Mandela's place as a great whatever on the world stage.\\" Some tabloids in Britain, Denmark and the U.S. were afire with speculation, as more photos came out and showed the three world leaders playfully interacting, with the first lady still sitting idly by. \\"UK papers making hay with Obama selfie & FLOTUS's face. Daily Mail calls PM Helle Thorning-Schmitt \\"the flirty Dane,\\" Jon Williams tweeted. UK papers making hay with Obama selfie & FLOTUS's face. Daily Mail calls PM Helle Thorning-Schmitt \\"the flirty Dane\\" http://t.co/dckRYIb1MS— Jon Williams (@WilliamsJon) December 10, 2013 Karl Erik Stougaard, online managing editor at the Danish newspaper Politiken, told BBC on Wednesday that the Danish press consider the now-famous selfie \\"humorous\\" and a \\"very fun story.\\" \\"I don't see anyone complaining or criticizing the Danish prime minister for taking a selfie at the memorial,' he said, joking that the Danish don't have their own word for \\"selfie\\" and stole the English version. In fact the word \\"selfie\\" didn't become a household name until just the last couple of years, as camera phones–combined with photo sharing sites like Instagram–made it easier to instantly spread the photos far and wide. This year the phenomenon also became a fun pastime for celebrities, who are more used to being photographed from a distance than an arms-length away. Selfies by people like Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and Beyoncé– even the Pope - further amplified the selfie movement. @KofC epic #selfie #PopeFrancis http://t.co/CLYduUpxDA— Fabio M. Ragona (@FabioMRagona) August 29, 2013 Nearly a year ago Obama's own daughters, Sasha and Malia, stole the show at their father's inauguration parade when they were seen taking selfies. The First Lady herself snapped a photo of her and the family dog at the White House. And in August of this year, Oxford Dictionaries cemented the word in the English language, giving it a spot in the dictionary after finding that usage of the term had increased by 17,000% within the previous year. 'Simply acting like human beings' Schmidt, the AFP photographer, said he was flummoxed at the reaction to the selfie and found nothing distasteful about posing for a self-photo at this particular memorial service. \\"All around me in the stadium, South Africans were dancing, singing and laughing to honour their departed leader,\\" Schmidt wrote in a blog post. \\"It was more like a carnival atmosphere, not at all morbid. The ceremony had already gone on for two hours and would last another two. The atmosphere was totally relaxed – I didn't see anything shocking in my viewfinder, president of the US or not. We are in Africa.\\" Responding to interpretations that Michelle Obama was peeved at her husband for lightheartedly engaging with his European counterparts–even perhaps flirting with the Danish prime minister–Schmidt cautioned that \\"photos can lie.\\" \\"In reality, just a few seconds earlier the first lady was herself joking with those around her, Cameron and Schmidt included,\\" he continued. \\"Her stern look was captured by chance.\\" In what's become the year of the selfie, Schmidt also questioned the new social media whirlwind in which photos that show such levity become the center of heated debate. \\"At the time, I thought the world leaders were simply acting like human beings, like me and you,\\" he said. \\"For me, the behaviour of these leaders in snapping a selfie seems perfectly natural. I see nothing to complain about, and probably would have done the same in their place.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The main points of this news article revolve around a moment captured at Nelson Mandela's memorial service in 2013, where U.S. President Barack Obama, Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, and British Prime Minister David Cameron took a selfie. The event sparked a wide and intense debate about the appropriateness of their act, with the single image turning into a media sensation. 1. Nelson Mandela's memorial service was intended to be a once-in-a-lifetime event honoring Mandela, but instead, became a media sensation concerning a selfie taken by President Obama, PM Thorning-Schmidt, and PM Cameron. Michelle Obama, who was sitting next to them, was not participating in the photo. 2. The moment was captured by AFP Photographer Roberto Schmidt, and when the photo became public, it went viral, prompting a surge in debate: Was this selfie a cute moment, or a tasteless act? 3. Erick Erickson, a Republican strategist, criticized the act, insinuating that it was tasteless, and conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh accused the President of trying to take the limelight and making the memorial service about himself. 4. The U.K., Danish, and U.S. tabloids speculated on the act, highlighting the playful interaction among the leaders, with the first lady sitting idly by. Some outlets seemed to focus more on the interpersonal dynamics depicted in the photo, such as the Daily Mail playfully referring to PM Thorning-Schmidt as \\"the flirty Dane.\\" 5. On the contrast, Karl Erik Stougaard from the Danish newspaper Politiken found the story humorous and didn't see any criticism towards the Danish prime minister for taking the selfie. 6. Photographer Roberto Schmidt was surprised by the strong reaction to the selfie and defended the act by saying the atmosphere at the memorial was more like a carnival, with people dancing, singing, and laughing. According to him, the leaders were simply acting like human beings. He also debunked the notion that Michelle Obama was not amused, saying that just a few seconds earlier, she was joking with those around her. 7. The article mentions the rise of the word \\"selfie\\" and how it has influenced our culture. The term was introduced as a part of the English language by Oxford Dictionaries, seeing its usage increase by 17,000% within the previous year. Celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Beyonce and even the Pope have been known to take selfies, further amplifying the selfie movement. 8. The author notes that this incident symbolizes the year of the selfie and how photos that depict informal moments quickly become viral and incite heated debates."},{"prompt":"Q:Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: go champion go Review: i love all of wonder's foals but i like champion the best because fo his spirit and wild nature. i also like that he won the triple crown!

Born Stephen Ray Perry on January 22, 1949, in Hanford, California, he served as the band's frontman between 1977 and 1998, with a brief reunion in 2020. Perry possesses a distinctive voice, which is often described as powerful, emotive, and soaring, significantly contributing to Journey's success and propelling them to international fame. Under his lead, the band released numerous hit records, including \\"Don't Stop Believin',\\" \\"Open Arms,\\" and \\"Faithfully.\\" Jaime St. James, on the other hand, is an American singer best known as the frontman of the glam metal band Black 'N Blue, which originated in Portland, Oregon, in 1981. Born James Pond on January 27, 1960, St. James remained with Black 'N Blue until their disbandment in 1989, after which he launched a solo career and became a member of other bands, including Freight Train Jane and St. James. In 2004, Black 'N Blue reunited with St. James still as their lead vocalist. To summarize, Steve Perry is the lead singer of Journey, while Jaime St. James is primarily associated with Black 'N Blue. Both vocalists have made significant contributions to their respective bands, as well as to the broader landscape of popular music, but it is Perry who stands out as Journey's iconic voice."},{"prompt":"Teacher:Given a text, write a compressed version of it in a single sentence.

Movie plot title: Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy Movie plot: In October 1973, \\"Control\\", head of British intelligence (\\"the Circus\\"), sends agent Jim Prideaux to Budapest to meet a Hungarian general wishing to defect. Prideaux is shot and captured. Amid the international incident that follows, Control and his right-hand man George Smiley are forced into retirement. Control dies of illness. Percy Alleline becomes the new Chief, with Bill Haydon as his deputy, and Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase as key lieutenants. Despite Control and Smiley's misgivings, their successors had already begun a secret operationâ\\"Witchcraft\\"âto obtain Soviet intelligence, which is being exchanged with the CIA for US intelligence. Smiley is brought out of retirement by Oliver Lacon, the civil servant in charge of intelligence, to investigate a claim by Ricki Tarr, a British spy, that there has been a long-term mole in a senior role in the Circus, as Control had suspected. Smiley chooses a trustworthy agent, Peter Guillam, and retired Special Branch officer Mendel to help him. He interviews Connie Sachs, who was sacked by Alleline after deducing that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet cultural attachÃ© in London, was a spy. Tarr tells Smiley that, on a mission to Istanbul, he had had an affair with Irina, a Soviet agent. She wanted to reveal the name of a mole in the top ranks of the Circus, but when Tarr reported this to London, they ignored him and ordered him straight home, whereas Moscow immediately kidnapped Irina. Tarr concluded that the mole had intercepted his message, and went into hiding, suspected of defecting and murdering the British station chief. Smiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr called: he finds the pages for that night are cut out, suggesting that Tarr's story is true. Smiley interviews Prideaux, who after brutal interrogation was exchanged by the Soviets but sacked from the service. Prideaux says the purpose of the mission to Hungary was to get the name of the mole. Control had codenamed the suspects \\"Tinker\\" (Alleline), \\"Tailor\\" (Haydon), \\"Soldier\\"...

Answer this question: name the membrane that connects the stomach with the liver??","completion":"The membrane that connects the stomach to the liver is called the lesser omentum, specifically, the hepatogastric ligament. The lesser omentum is a thin, double-layered fold of peritoneum connecting the lesser curvature of the stomach and the proximal part of the duodenum to the liver. The peritoneum is a membrane that forms the lining of the abdominal cavity and covers most of the organs within the abdomen. The lesser omentum can be divided into two different ligaments, the hepatogastric ligament, and the hepatoduodenal ligament. The hepatogastric ligament connects the liver to the stomach, while the hepatoduodenal ligament connects the liver to the duodenum. The purpose of this membranous connection is to provide structural support and stability between the stomach and the liver. It also serves as a pathway for blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics to and from these organs, maintaining their position while allowing some degree of mobility. The lesser omentum and its ligaments play an essential role in the anatomy and function of the digestive system by ensuring the proper position and functioning of the stomach, liver, and other organs within the abdominal cavity. It also has a role in securing the liver's function concerning the filtration and processing of nutrients absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. In summary, the lesser omentum, particularly the hepatogastric ligament, is the membrane that connects the stomach to the liver, providing structural support and a pathway for blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics between the two organs."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Background: Millions of people in the world jog for exercise.

Write an article based on this summary: Leading Republicans in the US have called for an investigation into leaks that led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn. Article:","completion":"Title: Prominent Republicans Call for Investigation into Leaks Leading to Michael Flynn's Resignation In the ongoing political saga surrounding the resignation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, leading Republicans in the United States have called for an investigation into the leaks that ultimately led to his departure. This latest development highlights the deep-seated concerns within the government regarding the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and its potential impact on national security. Michael Flynn, a retired United States Army Lieutenant General, was appointed by President Donald Trump as the national security adviser in January 2021. Flynn's tenure was short-lived, however, as he tendered his resignation on February 13, just 24 days into his role. The resignation came on the heels of revelations that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top White House officials about the nature of his conversations with then-Russian Ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. As reports of Flynn's misconduct circulated, it became apparent that the information had come from anonymous sources within the government. These leaks, which included details of classified communications and intelligence, not only expedited Flynn's resignation but also exposed an undercurrent of opposition to Trump's administration within the government itself. In light of these leaks, several high-ranking Republicans are now pushing for an investigation to determine the origin and motivations of the leaks. They argue that the unauthorized release of sensitive information could have serious consequences for the nation's security and foreign relations. Among these Republican voices are Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who said, \\"I think it's important to find out who was responsible for the leaks,\\" and Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who stated, \\"We should find out what the Russians know, what they're doing and how much of it is accurate, and then we should find out who provided that information.\\" Congressional Democrats, on the other hand, are more focused on scrutinizing the broader issue of the Trump administration's alleged ties to Russia and the potential implications for national security. As such, some might see the calls for an investigation into the leaks as a diversionary tactic to shift attention away from the administration's possible collusion with a foreign government. Nonetheless, the concern surrounding the leaks raises critical questions about the current state of the U.S. government and the fragility of trust within its ranks. Classified information is meant to be safeguarded under strict protocols to prevent undermining national security or foreign policy initiatives. The leaks that led to Flynn's resignation serve as a stark reminder of the risks associated with the unauthorized disclosure of such information. The potential fallout of these leaks extends beyond the singular issue of Michael Flynn's resignation. The growing polarization within the U.S. government and the alleged ties between the Trump administration and Russia have far-reaching consequences for both domestic and international policies. If the identities and motivations behind the leaks remain unknown, it becomes increasingly difficult to forge a united front and address pressing issues, whether they pertain to national security or international diplomacy. Moreover, there is a growing consensus that the key tenets of democracy, such as transparency and accountability, are being challenged by such practices. An investigation into the leaks, as called for by leading Republicans, could serve to strengthen these principles by revealing the truth and allowing justice to prevail. In conclusion, the calls for an investigation into the leaks leading to Michael Flynn's resignation underscore the pressing need to examine the underlying issues plaguing the current U.S. political landscape. With concerns over national security and the integrity of democratic values taking center stage, it seems imperative that the government, irrespective of its partisan affiliations, comes together to address the issue of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and work collectively to restore trust and foster unity within its ranks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They mentioned that the place was empty during their visit, the bartender was frequently missing, and the club soda tasted strange. Additionally, they pointed out the inconsistency in their drinks being served in red plastic cups while others received glasses. Another significant concern raised in the review was the treatment of the staff, particularly the bartender not being allowed to wear a jacket to stay warm, even though it was freezing inside. The reviewer was repulsed by the focus on sexuality at the expense of employee comfort, and they mentioned the apparent manager's appearance, suggesting a possible connection to this policy.

Answer:","completion":"From the given review, \\"Eegsg,\\" it is quite challenging to provide a concrete recommendation regarding the app since the review consists of an unclear and nondescript word. An effective evaluation on whether to recommend this app to a friend requires more comprehensive information and relevant feedback about the app's functionality, usability, and overall user experience. Ideally, we could look into other detailed reviews from different users, focusing on areas such as the app's features, its ease of use, how well it serves its purpose, and whether it brings value to the user. We can also investigate the user ratings and compare the app to similar competing applications on the market. Moreover, considering personal preferences and the tastes of the friend you might recommend this app to would be helpful for making a more informed decision. Each person might have different expectations from an app and even may give more importance to some aspects like the visual design, support, or social media integration than others. Given the current insufficient piece of information, it is not possible to categorize a recommendation between \\"Not at all,\\" \\"No,\\" \\"Maybe,\\" \\"Yes,\\" or \\"Definitely.\\" Acquiring and examining more reviews and understanding the app's purpose will be crucial for delivering a thoughtful and accurate recommendation. In the meantime, a cautious approach would lead the recommendation towards \\"Maybe,\\" primarily due to the lack of sufficient data.

Elena The answer is:","completion":"Title: The Enigma of Elena Genre: Mystery, Thriller, Drama Act I: The Intrigue The film opens in a small, seemingly idyllic coastal town. Known for its close-knit community and serene landscapes, the town is considered a perfect place to settle down. Still, something unusual has been stirring in recent weeks. The men in the town appear to be increasingly distracted, their gazes wandering, and their thoughts often distant. They have become less engaged with their families, work, and routine lives, causing ripples of tension throughout the community. Amidst these seemingly inexplicable occurrences, a mysterious and alluring woman named Elena arrives in town. She has an enigmatic air about her, and it doesn't take long for the town's folks to notice her striking beauty and captivating presence. Elena makes her mark, capturing everyone's attention, yet no one seems to know anything specific about her past or why she's come to their small town. Act II: The Investigation Curious about the sudden change in their husbands, fathers, and brothers, the women of the town band together to get to the bottom of the mystery. They suspect Elena could be connected to this unusual behavior and decide to investigate her further. To their surprise, they find it incredibly difficult to uncover any information about her past. Elena remains a puzzle as she maintains a tranquil demeanor, yet something secretive veils her eyes. As the women continue their search for answers, they come across a series of old newspaper clippings that tell the tale of a beautiful woman whose presence had caused a similar phenomenon in different towns decades prior. They find similarities between the descriptions of this woman and Elena, sparking their curiosity even further. The women become increasingly anxious for the safety of their families and their community, fearing Elena's influence could lead to something far more sinister than just distraction. Act III: The Revelation The women of the town finally confront Elena, demanding to know who she is and what she wants. At first, she remains calm and elusive, but as the tension rises, she breaks down and reveals her true nature. Elena, it turns out, is a centuries-old spirit who feeds off the energy of the men she bewitches. Every few decades, she must find a new town to replenish herself, using her charm and beauty to captivate and distract her male victims. Time is running out for the men of the town - they are growing weaker under Elena's hold and will soon be beyond help. The women, determined to save their loved ones and rid their town of her malevolent influence, join forces to confront this powerful spirit. Employing ancient rituals and the power of sisterhood, the women manage to trap Elena and ultimately defeat her. Act IV: The Aftermath In the aftermath of their battle with Elena, the women return to their families, reuniting with the men and nursing them back to health. The experience has taught them the strength of unity and has brought them closer together than ever before. The town returns to its peaceful and serene state, and the community becomes stronger for having faced and overcome a supernatural threat.

His initial plan was to sell the property and use the money to advance his career in the big city. However, after a visit to the motel and meeting the friendly yet struggling townspeople, John has a change of heart. During his stay at the motel, he notices the growing homelessness crisis in the town. Driven by his father's ethos of compassion and his newfound sense of responsibility, John decides to transform the Riverside Inn into a homeless shelter. At first, he faces opposition and skepticism from the town's council and some of the local residents who are unsure of how the shelter will affect their community. As John begins to understand the stories of the people needing his shelter, he becomes more determined than ever to help them. The motel's transformation into a shelter begins with the help of Sarah, a kind-hearted social worker, who becomes John's greatest ally in his cause. As the weeks go by, the once-abandoned motel becomes a thriving shelter, bringing hope and renewed dignity to the lives of the town's homeless population. John and Sarah form a powerful bond as they work together, and their efforts also help to mend the community's fractured relationships. The townspeople, initially hesitant, start to contribute to the shelter - volunteering, donating, and organizing supportive events for the shelter's residents. The shelter's success gradually wins over most of the town, and the local government begins to take note. The council, led by the stubborn mayor, realizes the positive impact the shelter has on their town and agrees to fund and support its expansion. In the end, John's efforts not only transform Riverside Inn into a shining example of kindness and compassion but also rekindle a sense of unity and empathy within the small town. The once struggling community becomes a beacon of hope and possibility for others facing similar challenges. John's father's legacy lives on through the shelter, and John ultimately decides to stay in the town, finding fulfillment in work and companionship in Sarah, who has stolen his heart.

Scotland's traditional whisky distilleries are facing a spirited fight... from England Scotland’s traditional whisky distilleries are facing a spirited fight... from England. Sales figures revealed by Marks and Spencer showed the chain’s Fine Single Malt English Whisky out-sold its new Scottish Single Malt by two to one during the Christmas period. Both bottles have been on sale for £35 - and the impressive performance of the English variety is being hailed as a ‘coup’ for the fledgling industry south of the border. Distillers believe a growing ‘English movement’ - as the Scots prepare to vote for independence - could have helped boost sales. ‘We were the first","completion":"retailers to introduce the concept of an English whisky to the market, and were delighted to see it resonate so well with our customers over the festive season,’ said Max Holloway, Head of Spirit & Cocktail Development at Marks and Spencer. ‘We believe the success of the English Single Malt lies not only in the quality of the product itself, but also in the increasing interest in the broader English distillery movement.’ The rise of English whisky can be attributed to a combination of factors, which have converged to create an ideal climate for the growth of the industry in recent years. One of the primary drivers of its success has been the experimentation of new flavors and styles by English distillers, who have embraced innovation in their pursuit of crafting the perfect tipple. Drawing inspiration from the unique qualities of their local landscape, the various components of English whisky production - such as barley, water, and wood - have combined to give a distinctive flavor, which sets them apart from their Scottish counterparts. Moreover, amidst the uncertainties surrounding Brexit and the growing likelihood of a second Scottish independence referendum, the emergence of English whisky has provided an opportunity for consumers to explore and focus on homegrown spirits. Riding the wave of this sentiment, English distilleries have gained momentum and achieved remarkable success. In addition, the support offered by the government has played a crucial role in the growth of English whisky. In 2009, the tax on small distilleries was reduced, allowing smaller operations to flourish. This has encouraged the rise of several craft distilleries across England, each producing their unique take on the classic drink. Consequently, the versatility of English whisky in terms of taste profiles and the support offered to the sector has made it more attractive for both investors and customers. The growth of English whisky has also been catalyzed by a shift in consumer preference towards artisanal, locally-sourced products. As people become more interested in the provenance of their food and drink, the story of the up-and-coming English distilleries and the passion of the people behind them have served as compelling factors in the purchasing decisions of customers. As English distilleries continue to thrive, their Scottish counterparts would be wise to take note of their successes and adapt their strategies appropriately, perhaps by embracing innovation and focusing on the unique attributes that set them apart. This would ensure that the Scottish whisky industry sustains its strong reputation and continues to prosper, despite the escalating competition. In conclusion, the impressive sales figures for English single malt whisky demonstrate a culmination of factors, including governmental support, consumer preferences, and a renewed focus on English products. While the Scottish whisky industry is rightfully iconic and respected worldwide, it would be wise to recognize the growing strengths of the English distillery movement and adapt accordingly to remain competitive in an ever-evolving market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The software, known as Boot Camp, was introduced as a public beta for Mac OS X 10.4 \\"Tiger\\" users. Boot Camp enabled users to install and dual-boot Windows XP alongside the Mac operating system on their Intel-based Mac computers. The announcement came after several efforts were made by third-party developers and hackers to enable Windows XP compatibility on Intel-based Macs.

Two out-of-town photographers in Birmingham that day were Charles Moore, who had previously worked with the Montgomery Advertiser and was now working for Life magazine, and Bill Hudson, with the Associated Press. Moore was a Marine combat photographer who was \\"jarred\\" and \\"sickened\\" by the use of children and what the Birmingham police and fire departments did to them. Moore was hit in the ankle by a brick meant for the police. He took several photos that were printed in Life. The first photo Moore shot that day showed three teenagers being hit by a water jet from a high-pressure firehose. It was titled \\"They Fight a Fire That Won't Go Out\\". A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography. The Life photo became an \\"era-defining picture\\" and was compared to the photo of Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima. Moore suspected that the film he shot \\"was likely to obliterate in the national psyche any notion of a 'good southerner'.\\" Hudson remarked later that his only priorities that day were \\"making pictures and staying alive\\" and \\"not getting bit by a dog.\\"Right in front of Hudson stepped Parker High School senior Walter Gadsden when a police officer grabbed the young man's sweater and a police dog charged him.

Michael \\"Jakko\\" Jakszyk (born Michael Lee Curran, 8 June 1958) is an English musician, record producer, and actor. He has released several solo albums as a singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist and has been the lead singer for King Crimson since 2013. His work has been variously credited to \\"Jakko\\", \\"Jakko Jakszyk\\", and \\"Jakko M. Jakszyk\\". Before joining King Crimson, he led bands for over thirty years, including 64 Spoons, Dizrhythmia, 21st Century Schizoid Band, Jakszyk Fripp Collins, and Rapid Eye Movement. Signing a solo deal with Chiswick Records in 1981, Jakszyk began to record his debut solo album, Silesia, aided by Dave Stewart, David Jackson, and Amanda Parsons. During 1982, Chiswick released three singles (\\"The Night Has a Thousand Eyes\\", \\"Straining Our Eyes\\", and \\"Grab What You Can\\"), although none were hits. A full release of Silesia was shelved at the last minute when Chiswick declared bankruptcy while the album was at the manufacturing stage (although the album had a limited release in Germany). Strengthening his existing links to British art rock, Jakszyk began working with Peter Blegvad and would go on to play on the latter's first three solo albums (beginning with 1983's The Naked Shakespeare). In 1983, Jakszyk signed a second solo recording contract with Stiff Records. Three further singles followed between 1983 and 1984 (\\"Dangerous Dreams\\", \\"I Can't Stand This Pressure\\", and \\"Who's Fooling Who\\") and recordings were made for a second solo album. Due for release in 1985, this album met the same fate as Silesia. It was shelved in 1985 when Stiff Records filed for bankruptcy. Discouraged but not defeated, Jakko supplemented his income with acting work while continuing to pursue music. He continued his collaboration with Dave Stewart, contributing to his duo work with Barbara Gaskin and playing a prominent role on the Stewart-produced Neil's Heavy Concept Album (a 1984 spin-off from the Young Ones comedy series). During this time he also met an up-and-coming drummer Gavin Harrison, who would become one of his most frequent collaborators. It was also during this time that he finally visited the United States to meet his birth mother. Jakszyk's third attempt at recording a solo album, this time for MDM Records in 1986-87, was shelved when MDM's distributor, Virgin Records, dropped its support. Some of the \\"lost\\" material from this and the previously shelved albums resurfaced on Jakszyk's 1996 compilation album Are My Ears on Wrong?, while Jakko's ill-fated first album Silesia was briefly issued on CD in the late 1990s. In 1987, Jakszyk joined Peter and Kristoffer Blegvad, John Greaves, and Anton Fier in the short-lived New York-based band The Lodge, with whom he recorded one album, The Smell of a Friend.","completion":"This text is about Michael \\"Jakko\\" Jakszyk, an English musician, record producer, and actor.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What did the Roman empire hire due to increased taxes?\\" Context: \\"The Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century politically unstable, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century, mainly in response to the war with Sassanid Persia, which revived in the middle of the 3rd century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Due to increased taxes, the Roman Empire hired more bureaucrats in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army.

Senators including Mazie Hirono, Claire McCaskill, and Maggie Hassan quickly followed suit. Here's what else you need to know: As of this writing, 16 Democratic senators—10 women and six men—have called on Franken to resign, including Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the Senate's highest ranking woman, CNN reports. As calls for his resignation swelled, Franken's office announced the senator will make a statement on Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reports. Article:","completion":"Title: Pressure Mounts on Al Franken As Calls for Resignation Multiply The case against Democratic Senator Al Franken of Minnesota has intensified as a seventh woman has come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct. Following this, a wave of female Democratic senators have called for Franken's immediate resignation. In light of these recent allegations, Franken's political future seems increasingly uncertain, with 16 Democratic senators currently pushing for him to step down. Among those urging Franken to resign, Kirsten Gillibrand has taken to social media to voice her concerns. In a statement she posted on Facebook, Gillibrand stated, \\"While Senator Franken is entitled to have the Ethics Committee conclude its review, I believe it would be better for our country if he sent a clear message that any kind of mistreatment of women in our society isn't acceptable by stepping aside to let someone else serve.\\" As the issue gains more attention, senators Mazie Hirono, Claire McCaskill, and Maggie Hassan have also joined the chorus calling for Franken's resignation. Additionally, 10 female and six male Democratic senators are urging Franken to relinquish his seat in the government. Among these is Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the Senate's highest-ranking woman. As pressure builds, Senator Franken's office has announced that he will make a statement on Thursday to address the situation. While the content of his statement remains unknown, many speculate that Franken may be preparing for an impending resignation announcement. This latest controversy follows a spate of high-profile accusations against powerful men in various industries, with Franken being one of the prominent political figures to face these allegations. Such accusations have taken the United States by storm and, more importantly, have raised awareness about sexual misconduct and the pervasive mistreatment of women in various sectors of society. Calls for Franken's resignation serve as a pivotal moment for the Democratic party, as it demonstrates the internal push for accountability in the face of these serious allegations. Senator Franken's decision to step down or not will be of great significance, potentially setting the standard for the party's stance on sexual misconduct within politics. Aside from the political implications, a possible resignation would also suggest that society as a whole is becoming less tolerant of any form of harassment or mistreatment. Sentiments expressed by senators such as Gillibrand underscore the necessity for change in the political landscape, pushing the fight for women's rights into the forefront of public consciousness. In the coming days, all eyes will be on Senator Franken as he prepares to make his statement. As the situation unfolds, the implications of the accusations against him will be felt not only by Franken himself, but also by the entire political landscape, as the nation continues to grapple with issues of sexual misconduct and abuse of power. Whatever the outcome, the growing chorus of voices calling for accountability in politics and beyond persists, signaling a significant shift in societal attitudes toward harassment and inequality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sean Patrick Hannity was born in New York City, New York, the son of Lillian (Flynn) and Hugh Hannity. Lillian worked as a stenographer and a corrections officer at a county jail, while Hugh was a family-court officer. He is the youngest of four siblings. All of his grandparents immigrated to the United States from Ireland. Hannity hosted his first talk radio show in 1989 at the volunteer college station at UC Santa Barbara, KCSB-FM, while working as a general contractor. The show aired for 40 hours of air time. Regarding his first show, he said, \\"I wasn't good at it. I was terrible.\\" Hannity's weekly show on KCSB was canceled after less than a year. This was after two shows featuring the book The AIDS Coverup: The Real and Alarming Facts about AIDS by Gene Antonio; among other remarks made during the broadcast, Hannity told a lesbian caller, \\"I feel sorry for your child.\\" The university board that governed the station later reversed its decision due to a campaign conducted on Hannity's behalf by the Santa Barbara chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued that the station had discriminated against Hannity's First Amendment rights. When the station refused to give him a public apology and more airtime, Hannity decided against returning to KCSB. After leaving KCSB, Hannity placed an ad in radio publications presenting himself as \\"the most talked about college radio host in America.\\" Radio station WVNN in Athens, Alabama (part of the Huntsville market), then hired him to be the afternoon talk show host. From Huntsville, he moved to WGST in Atlanta in 1992, filling the slot vacated by Neal Boortz, who had moved to competing station WSB. In September 1996, Fox News co-founder Roger Ailes hired the then relatively unknown Hannity to host a television program under the working title Hannity and LTBD (\\"liberal to be determined\\"). Alan Colmes was then hired to co-host and the show debuted as Hannity & Colmes. Later that year, Hannity left WGST for New York, where WABC had him substitute for their afternoon drive time host during Christmas week. In January 1997, WABC put Hannity on the air full-time, giving him the late night time slot. WABC then moved Hannity to the same drive time slot he had filled temporarily a little more than a year earlier. Hannity was on WABC's afternoon time slot from January 1998 until the end of 2013. Since January 2014, Hannity has hosted the 3-6 p.m. time slot on WOR in New York City. In their 2007 book Common Ground: How to Stop the Partisan War That Is Destroying America, conservative Cal Thomas and liberal Bob Beckel describe Hannity as a leader of the pack among broadcasting political polarizers, which following James Q.

The writer travels to Old Haven on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, where Lang and his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) are staying, along with Lang's personal assistant (and implied mistress), Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall). Amelia forbids the writer to take McAra's manuscript outside, emphasizing that it is a security risk. Shortly after the writer's arrival, former Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh) accuses Lang of authorizing the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA, a possible war crime. Lang faces prosecution by the International Criminal Court unless he stays in the U.S. (or one of the few other countries that does not recognise the court's jurisdiction). While Lang is in Washington, the writer finds items in McAra's room suggesting he might have stumbled across a dark secret.

If Jerusalem, the most fiercely disputed real-estate, came under international protection., can we conclude that \\"Jerusalem is under international protection because many groups fight over it.\\"? Choose from: (a). yes (b). it is not possible to tell (c). no","completion":"(b). it is not possible to tell The statement \\"Jerusalem is under international protection because many groups fight over it\\" would be an oversimplification of the situation. First, we need to address the reasons behind considering placing Jerusalem under international protection and then discuss whether it actually has come under such protection, as there have been proposals but no concrete multilateral agreement. Jerusalem is a city of great historical, cultural, and religious significance for millions of people worldwide. It is considered a holy city by the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. As such, Jerusalem has been a site of conflict for centuries, with different groups vying for control and influence over the city. These conflicts have led to proposals about placing the city under international protection, with the aim of ensuring all parties are allowed to access and manage their respective religious sites. The idea of Jerusalem being under international protection dates back to 1947 when the United Nations proposed the Partition Plan for Palestine. According to UN resolution 181, Jerusalem was to be established as a corpus separatum, or a separate entity, governed by a special international regime under the UN Trusteeship Council's administration. The plan was an attempt to manage the competing claims over the city and protect the religious and cultural interests of all parties involved. However, the plan never materialized, largely because Arab nations opposed the partition and surrounding Arab states subsequently attacked the newly formed state of Israel in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Throughout the years, various initiatives, resolutions, and peace processes have attempted to address the status of Jerusalem. For instance, the 1993 Oslo Accords suggested reevaluating Jerusalem's status during permanent status negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. While there have been proposals recommending putting Jerusalem under international control or designating it as the capital for both Israel and Palestine, no consensus has been reached thus far. In the current state of affairs, Israel considers Jerusalem as its undivided capital, and it exercises full control over the city, including the contentious Eastern part, which was occupied during the 1967 Six-Day War. Meanwhile, Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. The international community has not reached a unified stance, with some countries recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, others supporting the Palestinian claim, and many more advocating for a negotiated solution to the conflict. In conclusion, while the idea of placing Jerusalem under international protection has been proposed due to the ongoing disputes, it is not possible to tell that Jerusalem is under international protection because many groups fight over it. The city's status remains contested, and negotiations between Israel and Palestine will likely continue to determine the future administration of Jerusalem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After Ty sees their truck being crashed into a tree, Vachel is stabbed with a serrated machete by a chuckling assailant who then dons Vachel's hat and jacket. Ty, seeing the murderer come out of the church, quietly flees off into the forest.

Context: Went straight from a facility that deals with homeless children (492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York) to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport about 20 miles away. It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home. I don’t even know the names of those I’m relegated to living with. The unnerving strangeness and disorientation hat comes with knowing that your life has changed and the culture shock that comes with that is so scary and desensitizes you on that first day.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the work in which Robert Christgau found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated? , can you please find it? Of Human Feelings received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics. Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional polyphony and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and \\"let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center\\". Giddins also highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \\"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \\"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\\" an artistic \\"breakthrough if not a miracle\\". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in The Village Voice, \\"the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian.\\"Purist critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar. In Stereo Review, Chris Albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused. Dan Sullivan of the Los Angeles Times believed the album's supporters in \\"hip rock circles\\" had overlooked flaws, arguing that Tacuma and Coleman's playing sound like a unique \\"beacon of clarity\\" amid an incessant background.

Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. But I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Here are some concepts: attraction, celebrate, firework What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"Celebrating special moments is a universal response to joy and achievement, encapsulating a wide range of activities and traditions that bring people together; a sense of festive spirit can be imparted through both small intimate gatherings and large-scale public events. It has been observed throughout history, that unique events or milestones, be it personal like birthdays, anniversaries or societal like the inauguration of an elected official or national holidays, are often marked by grand festivities. Among the many ways that celebrations can manifest, a popular and visually stunning method is through the usage of fireworks. Fireworks, a form of low explosive pyrotechnic devices used primarily for aesthetic and entertainment purposes, have been utilized in celebrations since their invention in ancient China. Ranging from small sparklers to large aerial displays that fill the night sky, fireworks have become synonymous with monumental events and big celebrations. Furthermore, fireworks not only offer a spectacular visual display but also serve to create a shared communal experience which can, in turn, increase feelings of attraction between individuals. This isn't attraction in the purely romantic sense but refers to a broader social connection and bonding. By drawing people outdoors together, the shared experience of watching fireworks tends to create a collective sense of awe and joy, establishing a communal atmosphere that can enhance social bonds and create a deeper sense of community. This communal sense of attraction can also be reinforced through our instinctive human response to light and color. Fireworks, with their brilliant display of lights against the night sky, naturally capture our attention, draw us together, and indeed, this can establish or rekindle connections between people. The intertwining of attraction, celebration, and fireworks is hence quite evident. A celebration with fireworks display can draw people together to spectate and participate, fostering a sense of community and mutual attraction. In the bustle of our contemporary lives, these shared experiences stand out as particularly salient moments. In the collective watching and revering of fireworks, we find ourselves momentarily freed from the trappings of our everyday routines, able to relish in the shared connection with those around us. The grandeur and beauty of fireworks, thus, transcends their visual appeal and serves to bring together communities and cultures in shared celebration and mutual attraction."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

He was famed for his travels and explorations in Asia, Africa and the Americas, as well as his extraordinary knowledge of languages and cultures. According to one count, he spoke 29 European, Asian and African languages. Burton was born in Torquay, Devon, at 21:30 on 19 March 1821; in his autobiography, he incorrectly claimed to have been born in the family home at Barham House in Elstree in Hertfordshire. He was baptized on 2 September 1821 at Elstree Church in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. His father, Lt.-Colonel Joseph Netterville Burton, of the 36th Regiment, was an Irish-born British army officer of Anglo-Irish extraction who through his mother's family - the Campbells of Tuam - was a first cousin of Lt.-Colonel Henry Peard Driscoll and Mrs Richard Graves. Richard's mother, Martha Baker, was the daughter and co-heiress of a wealthy English squire, Richard Baker (1762-1824), of Barham House, Hertfordshire, for whom he was named. Burton had two siblings, Maria Katherine Elizabeth Burton (who married Lt.-General Sir Henry William Stisted) and Edward Joseph Netterville Burton, born in 1823 and 1824, respectively. Burton's family travelled considerably during his childhood. In 1825, they moved to Tours, France. Burton's early education was provided by various tutors employed by his parents. He first began a formal education in 1829 at a preparatory school on Richmond Green in Richmond, Surrey, run by Rev. Charles Delafosse. Over the next few years, his family travelled between England, France, and Italy. Burton showed an early gift for languages and quickly learned French, Italian, Neapolitan, and Latin, as well as several dialects. During his youth, he was rumored to have carried on an affair with a young Roma (Gypsy) woman, learning the rudiments of her language, Romani. The peregrinations of his youth may have encouraged Burton to regard himself as an outsider for much of his life. As he put it, \\"Do what thy manhood bids thee do, from none but self expect applause\\". Burton matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 19 November 1840. Before getting a room at the college, he lived for a short time in the house of Dr. William Alexander Greenhill, then physician to the Radcliffe Infirmary. Here, he met John Henry Newman, whose churchwarden was Dr. Greenhill. Despite his intelligence and ability, Burton was antagonised by his teachers and peers. During his first term, he is said to have challenged another student to a duel after the latter mocked Burton's moustache. Burton continued to gratify his love of languages by studying Arabic; he also spent his time learning falconry and fencing. In April 1842, he attended a steeplechase in deliberate violation of college rules and subsequently dared to tell the college authorities that students should be allowed to attend such events. Hoping to be merely \\"rusticated\\" - that is, suspended with the possibility of reinstatement, the punishment received by some less provocative students who had also visited the steeplechase - he was instead permanently expelled from Trinity College. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: where was burton educated?","completion":"Burton's early education was provided by various tutors employed by his parents.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Lydia Warren. PUBLISHED:. 13:42 EST, 5 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 14:08 EST, 5 August 2013. Gina DeJesus, one of the three women who was snatched from the streets and held captive in a Cleveland house for a decade, has made her first public appearance since her dramatic escape. The 23-year-old looked relaxed as she waved a flag and threw treats to the crowd during the annual Puerto Rican Parade and Latino Fest on Sunday. Although Gina thanked her supporters in a video released by the three survivors a month ago, it is the first time she has been seen in public since just her escape from the house on May 6. Her smiling, relaxed appearance came in stark contrast with the gaunt, shaky figure that appeared in police interview footage shortly after her escape three months ago. Scroll down for video. Free: Gina DeJesus laughed and waved as she took part in a parade on Sunday - in her first public appearance since she escaped the house of horrors where she was held captive for a decade. Support: Gina, right, took part in the Puerto Rican Parade and Latino Fest for a city council candidate. The other survivors, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight, have also stepped out in public in remarkable shows of courage. Berry, 27, was pictured dancing at a Nelly concert last. month, while 32-year-old Knight faced her captor, Ariel. Castro, at his sentencing in court last week before returning to the. home on Seymour Avenue on Friday to thank neighbors for their support. Members of the community who attended the parade on Sunday said they became emotional when they saw DeJesus, whose family is Puerto Rican. She was riding with relatives as part of the Janet Garcia for City Council group. 'It was very beautiful. I got chills when I saw her on top of the car,' Vivian Prez, who watched the parade, told Fox8. Happy to be there: Gina seemed at ease as she rode atop the car and waved to the crowds. Joy: DeJesus gave a 'thumbs-up' - an echo of the sign she gave as she arrived home after her escape. Parade: She took part in the annual parade where local groups raised awareness of missing people. Aida Cruz added: 'I got emotional when. I saw her. I got a granddaughter back there, looked like she was about. to cry. It was just very emotional.' The. theme of the parade was 'a celebration of renewed hope and community. healing', and many taking part in the festival held posters bearing the. faces of people missing from the area. DeJesus' father Felix also spoke at the Latino Fest with his wife by his side as he pleaded with the crowd to keep their ears and eyes open to help find other missing children in the state. 'I want to tell you Gina, Amanda and Michelle are doing beautiful,' he said. 'I got to tell you something. Our work is not done. We have more beautiful children out there that need our help.' Fighter: DeJesus was gaunt in a video of her interview with police shortly after her escape on May 6, left, while a video taken a month ago shows her smiling and looking healthy. Home: Gina poses with her mother, Nancy Ruiz, after a company donated a privacy fence last month. Community activist Angel Arroyo added:. 'On Friday, there were still 95 people in this city missing. Fifty. people from the list are children, 45 people are adults and so we still. have a lot right here.' The three survivors released a video last month thanking people for their support and donations. After. their escape from Ariel Castro's house, The Cleveland Courage Fund was. set up to help them rebuild their lives and has so far raised more than. 1.2 million. 'I would like to say thank you for the. support,' DeJesus said in the video, while the other two women spoke. out at greater length. The. three women and a six-year-old girl fathered by Castro were saved from. the house in Cleveland in May after Amanda Berry managed to escape,. alert neighbors and call 911. Having fun: Amanda Berry, second left, made her first public appearance on stage with rapper Nelly on July 27. Appearance: Michelle Knight, pictured right, stepped out in public on Friday to thank neighbors near the home she had been held captive for a decade with the other girls. They had been kidnapped between 2002 and 2004 and held captive at the home for more than a decade, where they were subjected to sexual, physical and emotional violence. Castro pleaded guilty to more than 900 counts and last week and he was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years for the sick crimes. He has started his prison term in isolation due to the high profile of the case. Graphic and disturbing evidence was heard during the four-and-a-half-hour hearing on Thursday, with Castro himself giving a deluded version of events in which he denied raping his victims. Standing in an orange jumpsuit, Castro. shocked the packed courtroom by stating there was 'a lot of harmony' in. the house where he trapped and abused the three women. Sick: Ariel Castro was given a life sentence plus 1,000 years behind bars for kidnapping and raping the girls. The detective in charge of the case described how Castro abducted the three women, took them to his home and immediately tied them in chains in the basement and raped them. He put a motorbike helmet on each girl and left them in the dark basement overnight, Detective Harasimchuk said. 'Each woman told me they were repeatedly sexually, physically and emotionally abused by Ariel Castro during the entire time they were in captivity,' he said. The women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 20 years. But at the hearing on Thursday,. Michelle Knight bravely faced him and said: 'You took 11 years of my. life away, but now I have it back. I spent 11 years in hell. Now your. hell is just beginning.' See below for video.

Vic read more about reptile reproduction, while Fox read more about fish reproduction. Which student learned more about male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water? Hint: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier.

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. (1996 Almanac, p. 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs Question: \\"What organization did Congress approve restriction on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take?\\" Response: \\"Michigan\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

Write a question about the following article: On 22 August, nearly two months after the main uprisings had been defeated, about 1,000 French soldiers under General Humbert landed in the north-west of the country, at Kilcummin in County Mayo. Joined by up to 5,000 local rebels, they had some initial success, inflicting a humiliating defeat on the British in Castlebar and setting up a short-lived \\"Irish Republic\\" with John Moore as president of one of its provinces, Connacht. This sparked some supportive uprisings in Longford and Westmeath which were quickly defeated, and the main force was defeated at the battle of Ballinamuck, in County Longford, on 8 September 1798. The Irish Republic had only lasted twelve days from its declaration of independence to its collapse. The French troops who surrendered were repatriated to France in exchange for British prisoners of war, but hundreds of the captured Irish rebels were executed. This episode of the 1798 Rebellion became a major event in the heritage and collective memory of the West of Ireland and was commonly known in Irish as Bliain na bhFrancach and in English as \\"The Year of the French\\". On 12 October 1798, a larger French force consisting of 3,000 men, and including Wolfe Tone himself, attempted to land in County Donegal near Lough Swilly. They were intercepted by a larger Royal Navy squadron, and finally surrendered after a three-hour battle without ever landing in Ireland. Wolfe Tone was tried by court-martial in Dublin and found guilty.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Sabine for the following movie plot: D'Artagnan (Michael York) and his father (Joss Ackland) engage in an exhausting sparring duel. The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson). As he makes his way through the indoor training ground, he sees Porthos (Frank Finlay) having his portrait done while Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) watches; outside Treville's office, Athos (Oliver Reed) has a shoulder wound attended to. Treville reads D'Artagnan's letter and asks to see the familiar sword, which D'Artagnan sheepishly produces; the commander knows the weapon, realizes what has happened and lets him borrow a new one. Unfortunately there is no place in the musketeers for him, Treville says, until he has established his reputation on campaign or in killing, but a place in the guard might be suited...

Translate to German","completion":"Im Jahr 1989, als der Kalte Krieg endete, hatte die Rote Armee das Land bereits verlassen und damit ihre Niederlage zugegeben. Nachdem die Welt fast fünf Jahrzehnte lang unter der stetigen Bedrohung eines nuklearen Dritten Weltkriegs gestanden hatte, endete der \\"Krieg\\" im Jahr 1989. Es handelte sich natürlich um keinen traditionellen Krieg, sondern vielmehr um einen ideologischen, wirtschaftlichen und politischen Kampf zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und ihren westlichen Verbündeten auf der einen Seite und der Sowjetunion und ihren ostöstlichen Verbündeten auf der anderen Seite. Mit dem Fall der Berliner Mauer und der darauf folgenden Wiedervereinigung Deutschlands begann der Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion, der letztendlich zum Ende des Kalten Krieges führte, sich abzuzeichnen. In diesem historischen und weltverändernden Jahr 1989 hatte die Rote Armee, die sowjetische Streitmacht, bereits eine entscheidende Niederlage eingestanden und war aus den Ländern abgezogen, die sie seit dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs besetzt hatte. Die Rote Armee war nicht nur eine militärische Macht, sondern auch ein Symbol der sowjetischen Kontrolle und Autorität. Daher standen ihre Bewegungen und Aktionen stets im Mittelpunkt der Weltbühne. Der Abzug der Roten Armee aus den besetzten Ländern war daher ein klares Zeichen für alle - Verbündete, Feinde und neutrale Beobachter - dass die Sowjetunion ihre Niederlage eingestanden hatte. Dies war jedoch kein plötzlicher Rückzug. Vielmehr war es das Ergebnis einer langen und schmerzhaften Auseinandersetzung, die sowohl auf politischer als auch auf militärischer Ebene geführt wurde. Mit der Zeit wurde jedoch immer deutlicher, dass die Sowjetunion trotz ihrer enormen militärischen Macht und ihrer riesigen atomaren Arsenal nicht in der Lage war, die westlichen Mächte zu besiegen. Die Niederlage der Sowjetunion im Kalten Krieg war natürlich nicht allein auf den Einsatz der Streitkräfte zurückzuführen. Es spielten auch viele andere Faktoren eine Rolle, wie die wirtschaftlichen Probleme, die die Sowjetunion plagten, der Wunsch nach größerer Freiheit und Menschenrechten in vielen der von ihr kontrollierten Ländern und nicht zuletzt der Wille und die Entschlossenheit der Vereinigten Staaten und ihrer Verbündeten, die Ausbreitung des Kommunismus zu stoppen. So, im Jahr 1989, stand die Welt am Ende einer Ära. Es war das Ende des Kalten Krieges, das Ende der sowjetischen Kontrolle und Hegemonie und das Beginn einer neuen Weltordnung. Und mitten in all diesen tiefgreifenden Veränderungen zog die Rote Armee sich zurück und gab auf diese Art und Weise ihre Niederlage zu."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Judith at the Banquet of Holofernes - the lady in the picture had. previously been thought to have been Artemisia, Queen of Pergamon, about. to drink the ashes of her dead husband. The app ‘Second Canvas Museo del Prado’ brings together ancient paintings with modern technology to explore 14 of the famous gallery’s most celebrated masterpieces. It aims to do away with the velvet rope holding people back in galleries allowing anyone peer into the depths of a canvas and see details that would otherwise go unnoticed. An X-ray function reveals the layers of paint and the construction of the canvases, while infrared vision exposes the artists’ sketches beneath, which can often be drastically different to the final painting. An infrared view shows there was originally another figure in Judith at the Banquet of Holofernes waiting to with a sack to put the enemy general's head into. The X-ray vision function reveals Velázquez originally painted María Agustina de Sarmiento, handmaiden of the Infanta Margarita in Las Meninas with a much larger nose.

For instance, zooming into the face of Saint John the Evangelist from Rogier van der Weyden’s 'Descent from the Cross' reveals tears rolling down his cheeks. Looking at the painting through the infrared function shows a splash of blood across his throat that van der Weyden later removed.

In 'Descent from the Cross', painted for the chapel of the crossbowmen’s guild in Leuven, Belgium, zooming in to the highest level reveals tiny crossbows in the very top left and right corners. People have often thought that the shape of Christ’s body in the painting is positioned like a crossbow too, revealing intriguing hidden symbolism. The incredible skill of this painting is also evident when you zoom in, the tears on the Virgin Mary’s face look like water on the canvas. Meanwhile, 'Judith at the Banquet of Holofernes' had at one time been thought to picture Artemisia, Queen of Pergamon, about to drink the ashes of her dead husband. However, the infrared view reveals that there was originally another figure in the painting, waiting with a sack to for the enemy general’s head, identifying the main figure as Judith. The museum created giga-pixel images of the paintings five years ago including the Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch and Self-Portrait by Dürer. To do this they combined thousands of high-resolution images to create one giant image of 1,000,000,000 or more pixels. This means the user can see the image in unprecedented detail. The app lets users zoom in and out to read the explanations of the key symbolic details of each painting. As well as exploring the works of art, users can interact with them, choosing their favourite detail to share with friends online. Gabriele Finaldi, deputy director of the museum, believes it provides a new level of understanding of the artwork, but that the app is not intended to replace looking at the original. ‘What we're presenting with this app is the opportunity to get right up close, taking you by the hand to show you details you might never notice,’ he said. ‘Visitors in the gallery can spend a minute, even just half a minute, looking at a picture. With the app you can explore every centimetre of the work of art in your own time on your iPad, leading to a deeper understanding of how it was created and every detail the artist included.’ Madpixel, the developers behind the app, hope to work with further galleries and museums to roll the technology out globally.

Options: - bookstore - supermarket - toy store - candy store - shop Explain why a human would choose \\"supermarket\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"supermarket\\" to answer the question above because among the given options, supermarkets typically deal with the widest variety and highest volume of products, which would require a cash register with an efficient system to manage a limited items line. Furthermore, supermarkets cater to shoppers who require basic necessities such as groceries, toiletries, and household items, making them a place of frequent and potentially high-volume purchases. Here's a detailed explanation for each of the options: 1. Bookstore - While a bookstore does offer a substantial variety of items, including books of different genres, magazines, stationery, and gift items, the range of products may not be as extensive as the ones available at a supermarket. Additionally, customers usually spend more time browsing in bookstores before making their purchase, thus, the checkout lines might not need to specialize in limited item lines to ensure efficiency. 2. Supermarket - As mentioned earlier, supermarkets carry a vast array of products, from fresh food to personal and household goods. The sheer volume and variety of items can lead to a high number of small-quantity transactions. In response, supermarkets often have designated cash registers for limited items lines in order to optimize customer flow and ensure a quick and efficient checkout experience for shoppers with fewer items to purchase. 3. Toy store - Toy stores do carry a wide selection of toys and children's items. However, the volume of transactions may not be as high as supermarkets, as people tend to purchase toys less frequently and on specific occasions like birthdays or holidays. Therefore, the need for a limited items line is not as pivotal for toy stores compared to supermarkets. 4. Candy store - Candy stores, while offering a delightful assortment of sweet treats, generally focus on a specific product category – candy. As customers usually buy candy in bulk or a few selected pieces, there is less necessity for a limited items line at the cash register in candy stores. 5. Shop - Depending on the type of shop, the range of products may vary. Smaller shops that are focused on a single product category may not require a cash register with a limited items line, as their inventory is less compared to a supermarket. However, larger, multi-category shops may still utilize a limited items line to manage customer flows during high-volume shopping periods. Overall, a human would choose \\"supermarket\\" as the answer because supermarkets deal with the most extensive variety and highest volume of products, requiring a cash register capable of efficiently handling a limited items line to ensure a smooth and prompt checkout experience. This allows customers with fewer items to not have to wait behind those with full carts, which optimizes the overall shopping experience for all supermarket patrons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What happened with the Ninentedo system? Context: The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor, and although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well-established rivals. The inexpensive Nintendo Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years, and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012. The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality titles, making it far less dominant than its predecessor, the PlayStation 2, and it took until late in the PlayStation 3's lifespan for its sales and game titles to reach parity with the Xbox 360. TechRadar proclaimed that \\"Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill – a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor, Xbox One\\".

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It is important to make sure that your patch matches the fabric in your item. Otherwise, it will stand out from the rest of the material. Look for a patch that matches the fabric of your item as closely as possible. If you do not want to buy a patch, then you can also use a scrap of fabric. Visit a local craft store to find fabric that matches your item, or visit a thrift shop and find something that you can cut up. You can even cut a scrap of fabric off of an old item that you no longer need or want. Frayed edges will get in the way when you are trying to sew the patch in place. They will also cause the patch to stand out more. Use a pair of scissors to snip away any frayed edges on your item. Try to make the edges of the hole as even as possible. You may need to cut your patch material down a bit depending on the size of the hole. Cut the patch so that it is large enough to cover the hole and any weakened areas of the item. The patch should extend beyond the borders of the hole on all sides by about 1” (2.5 cm). Cut the patch so that it is the same shape as the hole as well. For example, if the hole is rectangular, then cut the patch into a similar rectangle. The item needs to be inside out when you sew on the patch so that the edges of the patch will be hidden. Turn your item inside out. Next, identify where the patch needs to go and lay it over the hole. Make sure that all of the edges are completely covering the hole and that the front side of the patch is facing down. Insert pins through the patch and item fabric along each of the edges to secure the patch in place. If your patch has fusing on the back of it, then you may want to iron the patch to secure it in place until you sew it. Apply even pressure to the edges of the patch to secure the patch to the fabric. Do not use steam. You can also use some adhesive, such as fabric glue, or double-sided tape to hold the patch in place until you are ready to sew. or needle. You can either use a sewing machine or hand sew your patch in place. Thread your sewing machine or needle with a thread that matches or will blend in with your fabric. If you cannot find an exact match for your fabric, then try using invisible thread. Depending on the thickness of your patch and item, you may want to use a heavy duty needle in your sewing machine or for hand sewing. For example, if you are sewing a denim patch onto a pair of jeans, then a heavy duty needle will work best. You may also need to adjust the stitch length. Use a straight stitch on your sewing machine or sew a straight stitch by hand using a needle and thread. Sew about ½” (1.3 cm) from the raw edge of the patch to ensure that it is going through the fabric of your item. Sew around the edges of the patch three times to ensure that it is secure. Remove the pins as you sew. Sewing over a pin may damage the needle and possibly even damage the machine. Trim the excess threads when you are finished.","completion":"The article provides step-by-step instructions on how to properly choose, prepare, and sew a patch onto fabric, ensuring it matches and stays securely in place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When he assumed the position as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig in 1723, he began the project to write church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year – Sundays and feast days – a project that he pursued for three years.Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral. In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the Hofkapelle, (\\"court capelle\\" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger, Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias: the so-called Hunting Cantata, BWV 208, as a homage cantata for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima (the second Sunday before Lent) Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18, on a text by Erdmann Neumeister.In 1713, he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the Marktkirche in Halle, succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow.

No. The two questions imply different things. The first question, \\"What is it like to have a tantric massage?\\" is asking about the specific experience or the nature of getting a tantric massage. This could be referencing the sensations a person feels during the massage, the process of the massage, or what emotions or thoughts one might have during this experience.

Tantric massage is a type of massage that utilizes tantric techniques for relaxation and healing.

This massage has deeper connotations, as it is related to certain philosophical and spiritual belief systems originating from ancient India.

The mention of \\"London\\" suggests this is an inquiry about a specific service, location, or business that exists in London which offers tantric massages.

They may be seeking operational details such as the location, operation hours, what specific services they provide, the cost, or how to schedule an appointment.

(June 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) When North Carolina secedes from the Union on May 20, 1861, the young men of a rural, provincial, North Carolina backwater known only as Cold Mountain hurry to enlist in the Confederate military. Among them is W.P. Inman (Jude Law), a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada (Nicole Kidman), a minister's daughter, and finds their whirlwind courtship interrupted by the American Civil War. Three years later, Inman finds himself in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, during the Battle of the Crater. Union soldiers tunneling beneath Confederate fortifications detonate over 300 kegs of gunpowder, in a futile attempt to undermine the position prior to their assault. As the ill-fated attack begins, Oakley (Lucas Black) an old acquaintance of Inman's from Cold Mountain, is impaled on a bayonet and mortally wounded. Inman rescues him from the fighting and takes him to a field hospital. Later that day Oakley dies in the hospital, with Inman and Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson) beside him. The next night, Inman, along with his Cherokee friend Swimmer (Jay Tavare), are sent to flush out surviving Union troops trapped behind their lines. During the raid, a burst of friendly fire kills Swimmer and seriously injures Inman. As Inman lies in the hospital near death, he has a letter from Ada read to him in which she pleads with him to stop fighting, stop marching, and come back to her. Inman recovers, andâwith the war drawing ever closer to an inevitable Confederate defeatâdecides to go home to Cold Mountain. On his journey he meets the corrupt preacher Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who is about to drown his pregnant slave lover. Inman stops Veasey, and leaves him tied up to face the town's justice. Exiled from his parish, Veasey later rejoins Inman on his journey. They help a young man named...

Answer the above question based on the context below: Shackleton's first task, on arriving at the Stromness station, was to arrange for his three companions at Peggoty Camp to be picked up. A whaler was sent round the coast, with Worsley aboard to show the way, and by the evening of 21 May all six of the James Caird party were safe.It took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness, after securing the use of a large whaler, The Southern Sky, which was laid up in Husvik Harbour. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel approached Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some 70 miles (110 km) from their destination. The Southern Sky was not built for ice breaking, and retreated to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.On reaching Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts, and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was informed by the Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. Then, with the help of the British Minister in Montevideo, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to Punta Arenas, where they met Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner Emma. McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again. Shackleton later named a glacier after McDonald on the Brunt Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea. After problems arose in identifying this glacier, a nearby ice rise was renamed the McDonald Ice Rumples.By now it was mid-August, more than three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island.

He is later shown joyriding with two others on a motorbike, harassing and shooting dead a mother walking her child, and then fleeing only to be killed by an oncoming lorry.The eponymous Harry Brown (Michael Caine), an elderly former Royal Marine and Northern Ireland veteran, tries his best to be indifferent about his violent neighbourhood. He lives in a small flat at Heygate Estate in Walworth, London. He often pays visits to his hospitalized and comatose wife, but avoids cutting through a noisy public underpass under a local motorway, which is a gathering spot at all hours for a local street gang. Otherwise, he spends his days drinking and playing chess with his best friend, Leonard Attwell (David Bradley), at a pub run by Sid (Liam Cunningham), a shady Irishman who takes kickbacks from a pair of black marketeers, Kenny (Joseph Gilgun) and Stretch (Sean Harris).Harry is awakened in the middle of the night by a phone call where he is informed that his wife is dying, but in order to reach the hospital before she passes away he must go through the underpass, but he is too scared to do so and arrives too late. After the funeral, Leonard confides that he is being bullied by some youths and shows him an old bayonet he now carries to defend himself, citing that the police would not heed his complaints. Leonard later wakes in his flat to find someone had pushed burning dog faeces through his mail slot. He goes on his balcony and curses loudly.The next day, Harry is visited by detectives Alice Frampton (Emily Mortimer) and Terry Hicock (Charlie Creed-Miles), who tell him that Leonard had been murdered. Members of a local gang, including the gang's leader Noel Winters (Ben Drew), are arrested, but they refuse to answer questions about the murder and are all released due to lack of evidence. Noel is very abusive to the cops and refers to his jailed father...

He kills several gang members, including their leader, Noel Winters. Detective Frampton becomes suspicious of Harry's involvement in the vigilante crimes, but sympathizes with his motives. Harry's actions lead to chaos among the gang members as they turn against one another, resulting in more deaths. Eventually, Harry confronts the corrupt pub owner, Sid, who is in league with the gang. Harry kills Sid after learning that he played a role in Leonard's murder.

In the aftermath, the neighborhood begins experiencing a positive change as crime rates drop, and the police ramp up their efforts to make the area safer, essentially fulfilling Harry's ultimate mission.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Images of repression and brutality against peaceful protesters demanding democracy and the elimination of corruption are not limited to Ukraine. In our hemisphere, Venezuelans are suffering at the hands of their own government. Violence and systematic human rights abuses have resulted in 41 dead, hundreds injured, and thousands detained. These rights violations in Venezuela were chronicled this month by Human Rights Watch in a 103-page report, entitled \\"Punished for Protesting: Rights Violations in Venezuela's Streets, Detention Centers, and Justice System.\\" The study pulls back the veil of President Nicolas Maduro's administration and shows its willingness to go to dangerous extremes to silence political dissent. It depicts an unraveling situation in Venezuela far worse than suspected. The litany of rights violations is illustrated in graphic fashion: the unlawful use of force, violent mass arrests, crackdowns on free speech and press freedom, blanket denial of due process, and abuses in detention facilities, including electric shock torture. Employing tactics perfected by the Cuban regime, marauding Venezuelan security forces are shown teaming up with armed gangs known as colectivos to beat unarmed demonstrators, firing live ammunition and tear gas canisters indiscriminately into crowds. In one instance, according to the report, a member of the National Guard \\"stepped on (a young protester's) head and fired rubber bullets at point-blank range in his thigh. The shot struck a set of keys in his pocket, dispersing metal shards as well as rubber pellets into his leg.\\" He was then taken to a military detention facility, denied medical treatment for hours, and lost so much blood that he was near death when finally permitted to see a doctor. While pro-democracy protesters are not fault-free in the use of violence, the primary responsibility for the horrifying, unjustified use of force rests with Maduro and his band of apparatchiks. Venezuela's alleged socialist paradise has morphed into a verifiable real-life nightmare. At a time when many countries in the Americas are experiencing an economic ascent underpinned by growing middle classes, every indicator reveals that Venezuela is regressing at an alarming rate. Frightening levels of criminal violence are coupled with economic freefall, punctuated by sky-high inflation and a scarcity of basic food items. In Venezuela today, the rule of law is abandoned, the judiciary is hollowed out, freedom of the press is nonexistent, and corruption runs rampant. Drug traffickers collude regularly with government officials and the free flow of narcotics out of the country poses a threat to hemispheric security, as well as to the United States. Last month, Maduro pleaded in The New York Times that \\"Venezuela needs peace and dialogue to move forward\\" -- but instead, he has delivered discord and suffering. With no alternative recourse against the crisis consuming their country, Venezuelan citizens young and old have been turning out in mass demonstrations since early February. Their courage has been met with repression, and the images flooding social media networks induce an outpouring of sympathy, mixed with terror and grief. Attempts by South American governments and the Vatican to mediate talks between the Venezuelan government and political opposition have collapsed and mass arrests continue. The Organization of American States must take a forceful position and demand respect for human rights and democratic inclusion in Venezuela. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, playing the role of a bystander to this chaos is unacceptable. My response to Maduro-inspired mayhem is authoring bipartisan legislation imposing targeted sanctions on those individuals responsible for violating the rights of peaceful demonstrators. While designed to avoid hurting the Venezuelan people, these hard-hitting penalties include asset freezes and visa bans for high-ranking members of the Maduro administration who have terrorized large segments of the population with unflinching impunity. The legislation also authorizes 15 million to defend human rights, support democratic civil society, and strengthen the rule of law. The moment of action is upon us. On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will pass this legislation. As a nation of the Americas guided by principles of liberty and democracy, we are duty bound to respond when the light of freedom is threatened. #SOSVenezuela is a constant refrain on social media networks, galvanizing international attention to the deteriorating situation in Venezuela.

Kamorudeen Abidogun said he received two rejection letters from Navarro College, near Dallas, saying that the school is not accepting international students from countries with confirmed Ebola cases. The mechanical engineer, who is originally from Nigeria but now lives in Richmond, has five relatives in Nigeria who were applying to the school using his home mailing address. Scroll down for video. Kamorudeen Abidogun said he received two rejection letters from Navarro College, near Dallas, saying that the school is not accepting international students from countries with confirmed Ebola cases. A letter Mr Abidogun provided to CNBC, and that has been posted on Twitter, carries the signature of Navarro College's international programs director, Elizabeth Pillans. After stating that the two-year community college is unable to offer the recipient acceptance for the Spring 2015 term, it quite clearly reads: 'Navarro College is not accepting international students from countries with confirmed Ebola cases.' 'I received, last weekend, two rejection letters...saying the reason why they were not giving admission was...Ebola,' Mr Abidogun told the news channel. He said he was 'disappointed' in the school's stated policy. Navarro's vice president for Access and Accountability, Dewayne Gragg, sent an email to CNBC after repeated requests from the station for comments on the situation. 'Our college values its diverse population of international students,' it read. 'This fall we have almost 100 students from Africa. Unfortunately, some students received incorrect information regarding their applications to the institution.' A letter Mr Abidogun provided to CNBC, and that has been posted on Twitter, carries the signature of Navarro College's international programs director, Elizabeth Pillans.

'Our focus for 2014-15 is on China and Indonesia. Other countries will be identified and recruitment efforts put in place once we launch our new honors program fall 2015. 'We apologize for any misinformation that may have been shared with students. Additional information regarding our progress with this new initiative will be posted on our website.' When CNBC asked for further clarification and whether there is or had been a policy to reject students based on the presence of Ebola in their countries, Mr Gragg said in an email: 'The prior email speaks for the college.'

Translate to Russian","completion":"Но предыдущие попытки создания глобального порядка имели свою долю тщетности. Однако прошлые попытки построить глобальный порядок столкнулись с немалым количеством бесполезных усилий. В истории было множество попыток создания универсального мирового порядка, основанного на определенных принципах и ценностях, и многие из них окончились потерпевшие неудачи. Среди самых известных примеров таких попыток можно отметить стремление к мировому господству различных империй, таких как Римская империя, Александра Македонского, империя Чингисхана, колониальные империи Великобритании и других европейских держав. Все эти проекты были построены на основе экспансии, завоевания и доминирования, и в результате не обеспечили долгосрочное существование глобального порядка. Кроме того, мировая история свидетельствует о множестве попыток создания международного порядка на основе более «мягких» принципов, таких как дипломатия и экономическое сотрудничество. Примером такого порядка может служить Вестфальская система 17-18 века, Лига Наций после Первой мировой войны или система коллективной безопасности, воплощенная в Организации Объединенных Наций после Второй мировой войны. Несмотря на успехи некоторых из этих моделей, особенно в послевоенный период, они также столкнулись с рядом ограничений и проблем. Нередко глобальный порядок оказывался заложником противостояния между ведущими державами, экономическими кризисами, неравномерным распределением ресурсов и развитием новых исключений. Можно сделать вывод о том, что построение стабильного и устойчивого глобального порядка остается весьма трудной задачей. Она требует разработки эффективных механизмов сотрудничества и функционирования на международном уровне, а также преодоления многообразных проблем, связанных с конфликтами интересов, глобальным неравенством и изменением геополитической обстановки. В этом контексте предыдущие попытки создания глобального порядка можно рассматривать как источник уроков и опыта, который можно использовать для улучшения будущих моделей международных отношений."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One possibility is generating replacement for a dying . All such possibilities, however, raise the concern that the clone would be treated as less than a complete individual, because he or she would likely suffer from limitations and expectations based on the family's knowledge of the genetic \\"twin.\\" Those expectations might be false, because human personality is only partly determined by genes. The clone of an extrovert could have a quite different way of behavior. Clones of athletes, movie stars, or scientists might well choose different careers because of chance events in early life. Some people have also put forward the belief that couples in which one member is infertile might choose to make a copy of one or the other partner. But society ought to be concerned that a couple might not treat naturally a child who is a copy of just one of them. Because other methods are available for the treatment of all known types of infertility, the traditional choice seems more appropriate. None of the suggested uses of cloning for making copies of existing people is ethically acceptable to my way of thinking, because they are not in the interests of the resulting child.

In the first quarter, Indianapolis scored first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark, along with a 48-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne. In the second quarter, the Jaguars got on the board with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 2-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Colts replied with Manning and Clark hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. In the third quarter, Jacksonville tried to come back as QB David Garrard completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Mercedes Lewis for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars drew closer as kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 47-yard field goal. However, the Colts responded with Manning completing a 1-yard TD pass to RB Luke Lawton. Afterwards, Jacksonville tried to come back as Garrard completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Dennis Northcutt (along with getting the 2-point conversion run). Indianapolis' defense managed to seal the deal. With their season-sweep over the Jaguars, the Colts improved to 10-2.

They were all happy at first but type B ovens started to short circuit. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which type of oven had fewer instances of voltage pushing a huge amount of charge through the wires? Hint: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat. A:","completion":"Type A oven had fewer instances of voltage pushing a huge amount of charge through the wires. Given the information in the paragraph, customers purchased two types of electrical ovens, type A and type B. Initially, they were satisfied with both types. However, type B ovens started experiencing short circuits, which are known for causing a sudden and significant drop in resistance. This drop in resistance leads to an enormous amount of current passing through the wires, causing them to overheat, and may result in damage to the circuits or even pose a fire risk. Since type A ovens did not mention any issues with short circuits, they can be inferred as having stable circuits that maintained their intended resistance. As a result, the voltage in type A ovens did not push a huge amount of charge through its wires, making it the oven type with fewer instances of such an occurrence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Identify the question The question asks for the type of cell division that produces gametes. Step 2: Define key terms Gametes: These are reproductive cells that are involved in sexual reproduction. They include sperm and egg cells in animals, and pollen and ovules in plants. Cell division: The process by which cells divide to create new cells. There are two main types of cell division - mitosis and meiosis. Step 3: Analyze the question Since the question is asking about producing gametes, we know we need to focus on the type of cell division responsible for sexual reproduction. Step 4: Provide the answer The correct answer is meiosis. Meiosis is a special type of cell division that produces gametes, which are necessary for sexual reproduction. During meiosis, the parent cell divides twice, resulting in four nonidentical daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes of the original parent cell. This allows for genetic variation and the formation of unique offspring in sexually reproducing organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,...

Hypothesis: Several kids are standing outside near the stairway. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"The given premise describes a scene where five children are sitting on a set of steps located outside, and we are asked to determine if we can conclude the hypothesis, which states that several kids are standing outside near the stairway. In order to examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let us analyze the differences and similarities between the two statements. First, let's break down the premise: - Five children: The number of children is specified as five. - Sitting: The position of the children is explicitly mentioned as sitting. - On a set of steps: The location where the children are sitting is on a set of steps. - Located outside: The steps are situated in an outdoor setting. Now, let's break down the hypothesis: - Several kids: The number of children mentioned in the hypothesis is not specific but implies more than one. The term \\"several\\" generally indicates an unspecified quantity, typically greater than two or three. - Standing: The position of the children in the hypothesis is standing, which is different from the position in the premise. - Outside: Both premise and hypothesis mention the outdoor setting. - Near the stairway: The hypothesis mentions the proximity of children to the stairway, but not necessarily on it. There are similarities and differences between the premise and the hypothesis. Both statements describe children outdoors, but the number and position of the children differ in both statements. In the premise, we know there are five children sitting on the steps, while in the hypothesis, it is unclear how many kids are involved, and they are indicated to be standing. To conclude, based on the discrepancies between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot confirm that the hypothesis conclusively follows from the given premise. The premise provides a specific description of the children's position (sitting on the steps) that is not consistent with the hypothesis (standing near the stairway). Additionally, the number of children involved varies between the two statements as well. It is possible that both scenarios occur simultaneously, with a distinct group of children standing near the stairway apart from the five children sitting on the steps. However, without additional information, we cannot conclusively derive the hypothesis from the given premise alone."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving. The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go. Answer:","completion":"Anning"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - They expand to take the air in - The cells of the lung hold the air - They take in the air and remove the Oxygen - They inflate and all the bad air leaves through the mouth - They do it all over again. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the lung is healthy enough to inhale happens, how will it affect there is no air available to breath. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyzing the process The process describes the functioning of the lungs when breathing: - Lungs expand to take in air. - Lung cells hold the air. - Lungs extract oxygen from the air and store it. - Lungs inflate, and the bad air (carbon dioxide) is expelled through the mouth. - This process is repeated continuously. Step 2: Analyzing the perturbation hypothesis The given situation involves a healthy lung facing a scenario where no air is available to breathe. Step 3: Evaluate the effect of the perturbation on the process 1. Lungs expand to take in air: - If there is no air available, the lungs will still expand in an attempt to intake air, but they will not be successful in doing so. Thus, this step is directly affected by the perturbation. 2. Lung cells hold the air: - Since no air is being taken in, the lung cells would not have any air to hold. This step is directly impacted by the perturbation. 3. Lungs extract oxygen and store it: - In the absence of air, there is no oxygen to extract and store. As a result, this step is also directly affected by the perturbation. 4. Lungs inflate, and bad air (carbon dioxide) is expelled through the mouth: - Even though there is no air to intake, the lungs might still attempt to inflate and expel carbon dioxide that's already inside. However, the absence of new air to replace the expelled air will lead to a reduced ability to clean the lungs, causing an indirect effect on this step. 5. The process repeats: - Without air, the process of breathing is essentially impeded, and the steps cannot be executed properly. The perturbation has a direct effect on the overall process. Answer: Yes, the supposed perturbation has both direct and indirect effects on the breathing process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","completion":"To provide the answer, I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Research the history of celibacy in the Catholic Church. Step 2: Identify the period when celibacy was introduced. Step 3: Share the knowledge I discovered with the user. Step 1: Researching the history of celibacy in the Catholic Church. Celibacy has a long and complex history within the Catholic Church. It is considered an important aspect of the lives of Catholic clergy, as it allows them to fully dedicate themselves to their religious duties. Step 2: Identifying the period when celibacy was introduced. The introduction of celibacy in the Catholic Church can be traced back to the early days of Christianity. However, it didn't become a strict requirement for clergy until the Lateran Councils. The First Lateran Council took place in 1123, while the Second Lateran Council occurred in 1139. These councils enforced the rule of celibacy for all Catholic clergy. Step 3: Sharing the knowledge with the user. Celibacy was introduced in the Catholic Church gradually, but it became a strict requirement for all clergy members after the Lateran Councils in the 12th century, specifically during the First Lateran Council in 1123 and the Second Lateran Council in 1139."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Afghanistan Ground War We believe plans are progressing for ground action in Afghanistan to begin over the next week. Rumsfeld and Bush are both overseas and it is unlikely that the attack would commence prior to their return. Forces earmarked for deployment include US Marines, US Rangers and British Marines. The Pentagon has reportedly suggested to London that it reclassify its marine commandos and paratroopers as \\"special forces\\" so the operation may still be depicted as an SF one. The tactical aims of such operations - which will see troops inserted by helicopter from Pakistan and then extracted via the same route - will be to destroy identified Al Qaeda targets in areas theoretically under Taleban control. Anthrax More incidents today with media outlets and politicians being the primary targets. There is a wide variety of media reporting on this, most of it unreliable. We reiterate that the U.S. government is equipped to handle isolated incidents of cutaneous anthrax exposures, but is not equipped to handle air-dispersed anthrax attacks on a wider scale, or more contagious biological weapons such as smallpox. The main impact of the current incidents (aside from those directly affected) is psychological; a further escalation of the sense of worry, which increases both political and economic pressure on the Bush Administration. Politically, there will be increased pressure \\"to do something\\" not only against the bin Laden network, but possibly Iraq. Economically, the anthrax incidents are simply another serious blow to consumer confidence. The Congressional incidents also are delaying passage of the fiscal stimulus package. Terrorist Sophistication Targeting Critical Infrastructure Not to be Overlooked The anthrax incidents also represent yet another attack against US critical infrastructure. Just as the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks represented attacks on our transportation infrastructure, financial infrastructure, and government infrastructure, so too do the anthrax attacks target our government infrastructure (Congress, Gov. Pataki) and our communications infrastructure (Fox/CBS/ABC/NBC & mail delivery). Both the September l1th attacks and the anthrax incidents have hit targets that are significant both as critical infrastructure and as symbols of American power. The threat at Three Mile Island reported last night suggests that the possibility of attacks against energy infrastructure should certainly not be ignored and should probably be expected.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Don't drive your kids to school. Let them ride a bike to school. In England 8.3 million children travel to school every day. It is reported that only a small number of pupils cycle to school (under 2%), although one in three children would actually like to. Experts say that to stay healthy, children need at least one hour of moderate exercise every day. But only six out of ten boys and four out of ten girls get that. One of the reasons is that parents have developed a habit of driving their children to school when they could just walk or ride a bike to school. Teachers often say that children who walk or ride a bike to school are more ready to listen to their classes, ask and answer questions in class than those driven by car, and the school journey is a good chance for children to learn about road safety and other life skills. Also, for many children, riding a bike is more fun than going to school by car. Most parents know the benefits . Then what's stopping them from letting their kids ride a bike? Safety is the number one worry for them. But actually riding a bike is not as dangerous as parents think it is. When you decide to buy a bike, you should be aware that a bike that is too big or too small is dangerous. Don't try to get a bike that your child will \\"grow into\\". Get the right size in good working order. Generally, 20-inch wheels are on bikes for 5-8 year olds; 24-inch wheels are for 9-11 year olds; 26-inch wheels are suitable for those over 11, and some older children should even take bikes with 28-inch wheels, but the main thing is that the bike fits your child.

The question asks about a requirement before someone can adopt. The possible answers are biological child, give away, birth, abandon, and orphan. Step 2: Eliminate the irrelevant options. 1) \\"biological child\\" - This is not a requirement before adoption, as the adopted child is not biologically related to the adoptive parent. 2) \\"birth\\" - This is also irrelevant because it refers to the origin of the child, not something a parent must do before adoption can occur. 3) \\"abandon\\" - This option, although it can lead to a child being eligible for adoption, is not a requirement for adoptive parents and doesn't answer the question. 4) \\"orphan\\" - This answer also deals with the child's status but does not address what the parent must do before adoption can take place. Step 3: Identify the correct answer.

Translate this to English?","completion":"In addition to this, I would like to thank Member Medina Ortega for his insights, which are based on his experiences of what it is like to fish in the Comoros and the Indian Ocean. The given text is in Finnish, and after translating it to English, it shows an expression of gratitude towards Member Medina Ortega for sharing his knowledge and experiences of fishing in the Comoros and the Indian Ocean. The Comoros is an island nation situated in the Indian Ocean, located between the eastern coast of Africa and Madagascar. Fishing is a vital industry for the economy of the Comoros and plays an essential role in providing food and livelihoods for local communities. Meanwhile, the Indian Ocean, being the third-largest ocean in the world, supports a diverse array of marine life and is home to many different commercial and recreational fisheries. Member Medina Ortega's experiences fishing in these areas provide valuable firsthand knowledge about the various challenges, opportunities, and nuances associated with fishing in these unique environments. Such insights can be helpful to inform decision-making and management strategies for sustainable fisheries in these regions and beyond. By acknowledging and thanking Member Medina Ortega for his contributions, the speaker highlights the significance of incorporating local knowledge and experiences in understanding complex issues related to fishing and ocean conservation. Fishing in the Comoros and the Indian Ocean presents a wide range of challenges and opportunities. For one, overfishing is a significant concern in many parts of the Indian Ocean, as some fish stocks are severely depleted due to unsustainable fishing practices, such as illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Climate change has further exacerbated these issues, as rising ocean temperatures and acidification affect fish stocks and their habitats. To ensure the long-term sustainability and viability of these ecosystems, it is crucial to establish and enforce appropriate fishing policies and regulations, conduct research on specific fish populations and their dynamics, and invest in eco-friendly fishing technologies and practices. On the other hand, the fishing industry also presents numerous opportunities for growth and development. For instance, by implementing sustainable and innovative fishing practices in alignment with ecosystem-based approaches, fisheries can maintain the integrity of marine ecosystems and continue providing food and livelihoods for coastal communities. Enhancements in technology, such as the use of monitoring and traceability tools, can support better enforcement of fishing regulations and combat IUU fishing. Moreover, promoting collaboration and partnerships among countries, as well as involving various stakeholders within the fishing industry, including local fishermen, can help ensure that policies are well-informed and tailored to the specific needs of the different regions. In summary, recognizing and appreciating the experiences and perspectives of people directly involved in fishing, like Member Medina Ortega, is essential in understanding the various complexities and challenges associated with this industry in unique areas such as the Comoros and the Indian Ocean. This appreciation emphasizes the importance of combining scientific knowledge, policy frameworks, and local expertise in addressing and managing sustainable fisheries and preserving marine ecosystems for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Gather your tools and ingredients: Tools: - A sharp knife - A cutting board - A spoon for scooping out seeds and pulp - A baking sheet or roasting pan - Aluminum foil or parchment paper for lining (optional) - Oven mitts - A fork to test for doneness Ingredients: - One whole pumpkin (choose a baking pumpkin, such as a sugar pumpkin or pie pumpkin, not the large carving pumpkins) - Vegetable oil or melted butter for brushing (optional) - Salt and pepper to taste (optional) - Additional spices, herbs, or sweeteners as desired (such as cinnamon, nutmeg, rosemary, or brown sugar) 2. Preheat your oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This is a suitable temperature for baking a pumpkin. 3. Prepare the pumpkin: First, wash the pumpkin thoroughly to remove any dirt. On a stable cutting board, carefully cut off the stem of the pumpkin with a sharp knife. Then, cut the pumpkin in half, from top to bottom. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and stringy pulp from the pumpkin's interior. You can save the seeds for roasting later if you wish. 4. Season the pumpkin (optional): If you'd like to add some flavor to your baked pumpkin, you can brush the cut side of the pumpkin with a thin layer of vegetable oil or melted butter. Then, sprinkle a dash each of salt and pepper, or any desired spices and herbs, onto the oiled surfaces. You can also drizzle the pumpkin with a sweetener like maple syrup or honey for added sweetness. 5. Arrange the pumpkin on a baking sheet: Line a baking sheet or roasting pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper if you'd like to make clean-up easier. Place the pumpkin halves, cut-side-down, onto the prepared baking sheet. This will help the pumpkin cook evenly and prevent it from drying out. 6. Bake the pumpkin: Place the baking sheet with the pumpkin halves into the preheated oven. Bake for approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the pumpkin's flesh is tender when pierced with a fork. The baking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of the pumpkin, so keep an eye on it and adjust the time as necessary. 7. Remove the pumpkin from the oven: Wearing oven mitts, carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven. Allow the pumpkin halves to cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet, then flip them over to fully cool. You may choose to serve the baked pumpkin as a side dish or continue by using the cooked flesh in other recipes, like pumpkin puree, soups, or pies. 8. Scoop out the baked pumpkin flesh: Once the pumpkin has cooled enough to handle, use a spoon to scoop out the tender flesh from the skin. You can discard the skin or save it for another purpose, like composting. 9. Use or store the baked pumpkin: You can now use the baked pumpkin in a variety of recipes, such as pumpkin pie, pumpkin soup, pumpkin ravioli, or pumpkin bread. If you don't plan to use the pumpkin right away, you can store the cooked, cooled flesh in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or freeze it for longer-term storage. With these detailed steps, you'll be on your way to baking a delicious, tender pumpkin that can be used in various dishes or enjoyed as a simple, seasonal side dish.

It presents an enriching tale of a man's struggle with a speech impediment and subsequent rise to leadership at a time when his country needed a voice. The film, [II] structured around King George VI and his speech therapy sessions with Lionel Logue, radiates a positive sentiment, echoing the resilience of human spirit and the power of unwavering friendship amidst extraordinary circumstances. The one aspect that immediately stands out in this film is the phenomenal performances by the leading actors. Colin Firth, as King George VI, stunningly captures the frustrations, doubts, and fears of a reluctant king with a debilitating stutter. His nuanced and heartfelt performance creates an immediate empathetic bond with viewers. Geoffrey Rush, stepping into the shoes of Lionel Logue, gives an equally impressive performance. His witty, eccentric, yet compassionate Logue builds a comradery with King George VI that serves as the backbone of the film's narrative. Helena Bonham Carter, playing the supportive queen, Elizabeth, adds another layer of warmth and strength to the film. Director Tom Hooper adeptly handles the historical narrative, piercing into the psychological dimensions of his characters. He meticulously creates an atmosphere of palpable tension interspersed with moments of sheer human emotions that make the audience feel the stakes. The Oscar-winning script by David Seidler brilliantly encapsulates the human drama woven into the fabric of a significant historical event. Another feature that deserves special mention is the film's cinematography. With astute use of visuals and meticulous camera directions, it adds to the narrative's tone, enhancing the emotional intensity and depth. With an all-encompassing soundtrack that evokes the perfect mood, The King's Speech sets an excellent backdrop that reflects the narrative's spirit.

In conclusion, The King's Speech is an inspiring piece of cinema that resounds with purity and authenticity. It is a mesmerizing amalgamation of impressive performances, intuitive direction, remarkable script and impactful music. The positive sentiment of determination, courage, friendship, and unfaltering optimism that it encompasses empowers and motivates, making this cinematic experience unforgettable.

To break down the sentence further, let's look at the individual Finnish words and their English counterparts: - \\"Tämä\\" translates to \\"this,\\" a pronoun used to point forward to something that will be mentioned, or to something already mentioned when used with the past participle. - \\"ei\\" is a negation verb, equivalent to \\"not\\" in English, and it is used to negate a verb or action in a sentence. - \\"todellakaan\\" means \\"definitely not\\" or \\"not at all\\" and is used to emphasize the negation. - \\"ole\\" is the present tense form of the verb \\"olla,\\" which means \\"to be\\" in English. In this sentence, it is negated by \\"ei.\\" - \\"yksittäistapaus\\" is a compound noun created from \\"yksittäinen\\" (single or individual) and \\"tapaus\\" (case or instance). It translates to \\"isolated case\\" in English. When these words are combined, the Finnish sentence \\"Tämä ei todellakaan ole yksittäistapaus\\" clearly conveys the message of a broader issue rather than a single, isolated event, and it emphasizes the importance of understanding and possibly addressing this issue."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Having heard several complimentary comments about the organization and efficiency of the place, I decided to see for myself. In spite of arriving early, I found that there were already long queues at the reception desks. While I was waiting, I looked around and had to admit that it is an impressive building: large and light with marble everywhere. Eventually my turn came and I presented my doctor's letters to the receptionist, who informed me that I was in the X-ray queue and I'd have to go to another queue and start again! I couldn't believe it and asked her if it might be possible to give me an appointment card anyway without making me queue up again. She informed me it was no good arguing with her and I should have read the sign, an almost invisible piece of card saying \\"X-rays\\" just in front of her where very few people can have seen it. No matter how hard I tried to persuade her, she wouldn't give me an appointment card for a blood test, so I started queuing again and finally got the card at 8: 30! I then set off for the blood test room, following the nice new signs until they suddenly stopped and I realized that I was in a part of the hospital that hasn't been finished yet! When I got to the door I saw a notice saying \\"Back in 10 minutes\\". I sat down and waited for 30 minutes before a doctor appeared and told me to come in without, of course, apologizing for keeping me waiting. I asked him why I'd had to wait and he explained he'd had to help out in another ward which was understaffed as a result of a flu epidemic among the doctors! I got out of the hospital at 9:45 a.m. and breathed a sigh of relief. I'm now waiting for the results. So, Mrs. Culley, a far from rosy picture.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Two men rappel down to retrieve the fallen hound, but they are killed. The third, hearing screams down below, rappels down to investigate where he finds his teammates dead and is killed by an unseen creature. Dr. Robert Verne (Robert Foxworth) is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements, where he feels he isn't making a difference.

Given the question: Question: She needed a new night table, what does she need to visit to get one legally? Choices: - furniture store - homes - hotel - hallway - grocery The rationale to choose \\"furniture store\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"She needs to visit a furniture store to get a new night table legally. A detailed rationale for choosing the answer \\"furniture store\\" can be explained as follows: 1. Appropriate source of desired product: A furniture store is the most appropriate place to shop for a new night table since they specialize in offering a variety of furniture items, including night tables. These stores typically carry a large range of styles, sizes, and colors and are specifically geared towards selling such items. This means she will have a plethora of options available to her, thus increasing the likelihood of finding the perfect night table for her needs. 2. Legal acquisition of property: Purchasing a night table from a furniture store ensures that the item is acquired legally. The transaction will involve a formal exchange of money for goods, and she will receive a receipt or invoice to prove her ownership of the night table. This way, she has a clear, legal right to the item and avoids any possible complications that may arise from acquiring an item through illegitimate means. 3. Safety and quality assurance: Furniture stores take responsibility for the quality and safety of the items they sell. Buying a night table from a reputable furniture store guarantees that it has undergone quality checks, adheres to safety standards, and is in good, functional condition. If she encounters any problems with her purchase, she can easily access customer service or return policies that the store provides, thus securing her investment. 4. Expert assistance and advice: When shopping for a night table in a furniture store, she can tap into the knowledge of experienced sales associates who can provide valuable insights, suggestions, and advice about the different night tables available. This expertise can help her make an informed decision and select the best night table to suit her needs, preferences, and budget. 5. Better options for comparison and customization: If she wants to compare different night tables or select specific features, materials, or colors, a furniture store is the ideal place to do so. She can see firsthand how the night tables look, feel, and function, which will enable her to make a more confident decision. Additionally, some furniture stores may provide options for customization, enabling her to create a unique piece that suits her personal tastes. In contrast, the other choices listed may not offer the same legal and satisfactory experience. Visiting homes or hotels to acquire a night table could involve theft, as it would not be a legal purchase, putting her in potential legal trouble. Hallways are not typically where furniture is sold, and it would be peculiar to find a night table for sale in such a location. Lastly, grocery stores rarely, if ever, carry items like night tables since they are primarily focused on selling food and everyday household items. Therefore, the most logical, safe, and legal option for her to acquire a new night table is to visit a furniture store."},{"prompt":"Q:Build a movie plot around this: Becca will no onger pay for her move to?

Article: Honey is an effective way to suppress a cough and soothe a sore throat. If you can, add ginger powder for quick relief. Several studies have found that honey is at least as effective at reducing cough than over-the-counter drugs, and is sometimes more effective. Honey helps coat and soothe mucous membranes. It can be very helpful right before going to bed if the cough is making it hard to sleep. It's good for adults and children, but do not give honey to children under the age of 1 since it could increase the risk of infant botulism. You can take the honey directly. Try 1 tablespoon every few hours while your cough persists. Another option is to add 1 tablespoon or more to a glass of warm tea with lemon. Some studies suggest that honey is as effective as a cough suppressant as dextromethorphan, an ingredient commonly used in many over-the-counter cough suppressants. Licorice root tea soothes your airways, helps ease inflammation, and loosens mucus. To make it, place 2 tablespoons of dried licorice root in a mug and pour 8 ounces of boiling water into the mug. Steep for 10-15 minutes. Drink twice daily. Don't drink licorice root tea if you are on steroids or have kidney problems. The active ingredient, Glycyrrhiza, can cause negative side effects for some people, especially those with high blood pressure. Look for DGL, or deglycyrrhizinated licorice, at your health food or drug store. It is just as effective. Thyme is used in some countries, like Germany, for a variety of respiratory ailments. Thyme helps relax throat muscles and reduce inflammation. Boil water and place the water and 2 teaspoons of crushed thyme in a cup for 10 minutes. Strain before drinking. Add honey and lemon for extra soothing properties. It may also help make the taste more pleasant. Do not use thyme oil internally. Use dried or fresh thyme. If you do not have any cough drops on hand or would prefer to stay away from medicated lozenges, you can usually soothe and stop a cough by sucking on a piece of hard candy. A dry cough that produces no phlegm can be halted by nearly any piece of hard candy. Hard candy causes you to produce more saliva and to swallow more, thereby suppressing your cough. If you have a wet cough that does produce phlegm, lemon drops tend to work well. Hard candy is an effective cough remedy for children ages 6 and older. Don't give hard candy or lozenges to children under 3, as they could choke. Turmeric is a traditional cough remedy that many people have found effective for coughs. Try mixing half a teaspoon of turmeric powder in a glass of warm milk. You can also try turmeric powder and a teaspoon of honey for dry cough. To make turmeric tea, add a tablespoon of turmeric powder into 4 cups of boiling water. Let it steep, then strain. Mix with some lemon and honey for additional cough-relieving properties. Ginger helps loosen mucus. Both ginger and peppermint can suppress the irritation in the back of your throat that triggers coughs. Add honey to this mixture for an even more effective remedy. Add 3 tablespoons of chopped ginger and 1 tablespoon of dried peppermint to 4 cups of water. Boil the water, then reduce the heat. Simmer until it has been reduced, then strain. Let it cool for a few minutes, then add a cup of honey, stirring until completely dissolved. Take 1 tablespoon every few hours. This can be refrigerated up to 3 weeks. You can drop a piece of peppermint candy into lemon juice. Heat it in a small saucepan until the candy dissolves. Try adding honey, too. Add 1 tablespoon 15 ml) honey to this mixture and stir to combine. Combining essential oils with steam can help you inhale the oils and reap the benefits. Try tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil, both of which are known to soothe airways and open passages. They also contain anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties which helps fight bacteria and viruses. Boil water and place it in a bowl. Let it cool for about a minute. Add 3 drops of tea tree oil and 1-2 drops of eucalyptus oil. Stir. Lean over and cover your head with a towel to trap the steam. Breathe deeply for 5-10 minutes 2-3 times daily. Just make sure not to lean close enough to the water to burn your face on the steam. Do not take tea tree oil internally. It is toxic when ingested. If you're interested in an effective cough syrup that is strictly for adults only, you can mix a little whiskey into your mug of warm lemon water. While the alcohol is not likely to have any effect on your cough, it can help you relax. Mix 2 ounces (60 ml) of bourbon whiskey, 2 ounces (60 ml) of lemon juice, and 2 to 4 ounces (60 to 125 ml) of water in a microwave-safe mug. Heat in the microwave for 45 seconds. Whisk 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of honey into the mixture and microwave for another 45 seconds. If you have a cough caused by the cold or flu, you could try making a batch of this traditional Korean cold remedy. It combines dried jujubes with spices, honey, and several other beneficial ingredients. Combine 25 dried jujubes (sliced), 1 large Asian pear (quartered and seeded), a 3-inch (7.6-cm) piece of ginger (sliced), 2 to 3 cinnamon sticks, and 3 quart (2.8 L) of water in a large saucepan. Cover and heat on medium-high until it begins to boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer for 1 hour. Strain the juice and discard the other ingredients. Add 1 to 2 tablespoon (15 to 30 ml) of honey to sweeten the tea. Enjoy a warm mug of this remedy to soothe your throat and stop your cough within minutes. One of the most simple things you can do is try to relax your body and take deep breaths. Salt water is used to help relieve sore throats, but can also help with coughs by helping the swelling go down and dislodge phlegm. Mix 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water, dissolve completely, and then gargle for 15 seconds. Spit out the gargle, and repeat until all the water is gone. Apple cider vinegar is a good way to get rid of a cough without drugs. You can heat it and drink it like tea with an added teaspoon of honey, or drink it cold with apple juice.

Mercury is a toxic element that poses health risks to all humans, but it is more harmful to children and the fetuses of pregnant women.

Several scenarios could result in reduced risks for women and children while those related to men remain constant, have also been reduced, or even increased. 1. The intervention was specifically targeted towards women and children, and there was no effort to reduce mercury exposure for others, including men. 2. The intervention was not specifically targeted at women and children, but they happened to have a more significant benefit due to their heightened vulnerability. 3.

In order to determine the validity of the hypothesis \\"the harmful effects of mercury on men have stayed the same,\\" additional information would be needed, such as data on overall mercury exposure levels, implementation of mitigation efforts, and any changes in exposure risks specifically affecting men.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Shortly after five, the hospital called. More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable.

To elaborate on this answer choice, QQ is an important chat tool that offers various benefits to its users. One of its advantages is the ability to connect easily with people who share similar interests, thus broadening one's sphere of connections and fostering enjoyable conversations with like-minded individuals. Additionally, QQ groups cater specifically to particular interests, such as language learning or hobby-related activities, which provide users with valuable information on their desired subject matter. Joining these groups not only aids in knowledge acquisition but also allows for more profound connections with fellow enthusiasts. However, it is essential to recognize the potential dangers associated with excessive use of QQ, as well as divulging personal information to strangers. Spending too much time chatting online can be detrimental to one's studies, physical health, and overall well-being. As a precaution, sharing one's telephone number, address, and ID number with unknown individuals can lead to serious privacy and security issues. In summary, QQ is a beneficial tool if used responsibly and for productive purposes, such as information gathering and connecting with others in meaningful ways. It is crucial to exercise caution, maintain personal boundaries, and practice time management to ensure that the use of QQ remains helpful rather than harmful."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Rediscovering Style: Embrace Bootcut Jeans and Corduroys for a Trendy Look Introduction: Fashion trends are constantly evolving, and keeping up with the latest styles can be a daunting task. However, sometimes the best way to embrace new fashion trends is to rediscover and transform existing classic styles to fit the times. Two such timeless wardrobe staples are bootcut jeans and corduroys. And, this season, it's time to rediscover them and dress them up for a chic and trendy look. Step 1: Choose the Right Bootcut Jeans: Bootcut jeans are a versatile and classic piece that flatters various body types and can be easily incorporated into different outfits. To achieve the perfect look, it's essential to choose the right fit, length, and wash of jeans. Opt for a pair that fits comfortably at the waist, with just the right amount of flare at the bottom to create a balanced silhouette. Additionally, consider selecting jeans in a darker wash, as this is generally more flattering and versatile for dressing up the look. Step 2: Pair Bootcut Jeans with the Right Top: Once you've found the perfect pair of bootcut jeans, it's time to select the perfect top to complete the outfit. A fitted blouse or a chic turtleneck sweater can create an elegant and polished look that can be easily dressed up or down. Alternatively, you can choose a stylish blazer or cozy cardigan for versatility and comfort—a key aspect of dressing up any outfit. Step 3: Trade Your Jeans for Corduroys: Corduroys are another wardrobe staple that can elevate your style without compromising comfort. Available in various styles, colors, and thicknesses, corduroys can be a fashionable alternative to traditional denim jeans. The classic wide-wale corduroy has a more pronounced texture, making it perfect for dressing up any outfit. For a modern twist, consider opting for slim-fit corduroy pants, paired with a sleek blouse or fitted sweater. Step 4: Accessorize Your Outfit: To dress up your bootcut jeans or corduroys, select accessories that will add a touch of sophistication and style. Statement belts, bold necklaces, and elegant timepieces can elevate your outfit, bringing a refined touch to your classic wardrobe staples. Consider pairing your jeans or corduroys with heeled booties or pumps for that extra lift and a polished finishing touch. Step 5: Confidence is Key: The most important aspect of dressing up any outfit is confidence. Bootcut jeans and corduroys are timeless pieces that have the potential to make you look and feel great, but it's essential to wear them with confidence. Embrace your style, showcase your personality, and strut your stuff in your revamped, trendy outfit. Conclusion: Rediscovering classic wardrobe staples, such as bootcut jeans and corduroys, can breathe new life into your wardrobe and enhance your overall style. By choosing the right fit, pairing them with elegant tops and accessories, and wearing them confidently, you can dress up these versatile pieces to create a chic and trendy look that's perfect for any occasion. So, why not give bootcut jeans and corduroys another chance and see how they can transform your style this season?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: who played mulder in the x files? A:","completion":"David Duchovny played the role of Fox Mulder in the highly popular science fiction television series, The X-Files. The show, created by Chris Carter, originally aired from September 10, 1993, to May 19, 2002, and then was revived for a shorter run spanning from January 24, 2016, to March 21, 2018. The X-Files revolved around two FBI special agents, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who were assigned to investigate unsolved cases involving paranormal phenomena. Agent Mulder is a believer in the existence of extraterrestrial life and government conspiracies, while Agent Scully, a medical doctor by training, often takes a more skeptical and scientific approach to their investigations. David Duchovny's portrayal of Mulder, with his dry wit and dogged pursuit of the truth, made the character iconic and contributed to the show's success. Over the years, Duchovny won numerous awards for his performance as Mulder, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series Drama in 1997. His chemistry with Gillian Anderson was a significant factor in the show's popularity, with fans often speculating about a romantic relationship between their characters. Duchovny appeared as Fox Mulder in various spin-offs and adaptations of The X-Files, including the feature films The X-Files: Fight the Future (1998) and The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008). In addition to his work on The X-Files, David Duchovny has enjoyed a successful career in television, film, and even as a novelist and musician.

Information: - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Melanie Clare Sophie \\"Mel\\" Giedroyc (born 5 June 1968) is an English presenter, actress and comedian, best known for her comedy work with Sue Perkins, co-hosting series including \\"Light Lunch\\" for Channel 4, \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" for the BBC and chat show \\"Mel and Sue\\" for ITV. - BBC One is the flagship television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands. It was launched on 2 November 1936 as the BBC Television Service, and was the world's first regular television service with a high level of image resolution. It was renamed BBC TV in 1960, using this name until the launch of sister channel BBC2 in 1964, whereupon the BBC TV channel became known as BBC1, with the current spelling adopted in 1997. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402. - Light Lunch was a Channel 4 lunch-time comedy chatshow broadcast on weekdays at 12:30 between March 1997 and February 1998. It starred Mel and Sue (Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc). The show was a huge success initially but audience figures declined slowly eventually resulting in low viewer figures and was deemed \\"unsatisfactory\\" by Channel 4. - Susan Elizabeth \\"Sue\\" Perkins (born 22 September 1969) is an English comedian, broadcaster, actress and writer, born in East Dulwich, London. Originally coming to prominence through her comedy partnership with Mel Giedroyc in \\"Mel and Sue\\", she has since become best known as a radio broadcaster and TV presenter, notably of \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" (20102016) and \\"Insert Name Here\\" (2016present). - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection. - Channel 4 is a British public-service television broadcaster that began transmission on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public corporation of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport, which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time. - The Channel Islands (Norman: \\"Îles d'la Manche\\", French: \\"Îles Anglo-Normandes\\" or \\"Îles de la Manche\\") are an archipelago in the English Channel, off the French coast of Normandy.

They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and although they are not part of the United Kingdom, it is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands. The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations nor of the European Union. They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively. The total area of the islands is 198 km. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912 January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century. - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden. - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government. - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. - A double act, also known as a comedy duo, is a comic pairing in which humor is derived from the uneven relationship between two partners, usually of the same gender, age, ethnic origin and profession but drastically different in terms of personality or behavior. Often one of the members of the duothe straight man, feed, dead wood, or stoogeis portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other onethe funny man, banana man or comicis portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent, silly, or unorthodox. If the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other will often be referred to as a comic foil. The term \\"feed\\" comes from the way a straight man is wont to set up jokes and \\"feed\\" them to his partner. - A television channel is a physical or virtual channel over which a television station or television network is distributed.

Yes Based on the provided context, it is reasonable to draw the hypothesis that the music industry is an industry that benefits from protection. The formation of the Featured Artists Coalition (FAC) as a nonprofit organization suggests that stakeholders within the industry have identified the need to protect the rights of featured musical artists in a constantly evolving digital landscape. This allows us to infer that protection plays a significant role in ensuring the fair treatment of artists and fostering a healthier, more sustainable industry overall. Furthermore, the goals and objectives of the FAC point to challenges that the music industry currently faces, particularly surrounding transparency, artist rights, and the connection between fans and artists. By addressing these issues, the FAC aims to create a more ethical and artist-centric ecosystem. This further supports the idea that the music industry benefits from protection, as efforts like these contribute positively to the artists' welfare, the relationship between fans and artists, and the overall growth of the industry. In conclusion, based on the context provided, it is appropriate to hypothesize that the music industry is indeed an industry that benefits from protection. By promoting transparency, protecting artists' rights, and fostering a closer connection between fans and artists, initiatives like the Featured Artists Coalition serve to create a more sustainable and equitable industry, ultimately benefiting all parties involved."},{"prompt":"- instrument is piano - years active is 1998 -- present - caption is olga culture at audi '' on november 11 , 2012 at the anniversary ceremony \`\` 50 years of - label is rca red seal -lrb- sony music -rrb- - genre is classical - birth date is 04 january 1986 - background is non_vocal_instrumentalist - image is olga scheps @ 50 years of culture at audi.jpg - birth place is moscow , russia - occupation is pianist Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Chicago is an American rock band formed in 1967 in Chicago, Illinois as The Chicago Transit Authority before shortening the name in 1970. The self-described \\"rock and roll band with horns\\" began as a politically charged, sometimes experimental, rock band and later moved to a predominantly softer sound, generating several hit ballads. The group had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Since at least 2008, Billboard has shown Chicago to be the \\"greatest of all time\\" American band in singles chart success, and since 2015, the \\"greatest of all time\\" American band in album chart success as well. The original band membership consisted of saxophonist Walter Parazaider, guitarist Terry Kath, drummer Danny Seraphine, trombonist James Pankow, trumpet player Lee Loughnane, and keyboardist/singer Robert Lamm. Parazaider, Kath, Seraphine, Pankow and Loughnane met in 1967 while students at DePaul University. Lamm was recruited from Roosevelt University. The group of six called themselves \\"The Big Thing\\", and played top 40 hits. Realizing the need for both a tenor to complement baritones Lamm and Kath, and a bass player because Lamm's use of organ bass pedals did not provide \\"adequate bass sound\\", they added local tenor and bassist Peter Cetera. While gaining some success as a cover band, the group began working on original songs. In June 1968, at manager James William Guercio's request, The Big Thing moved to Los Angeles, California, and signed with Columbia Records. The band changed its name to \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\". It was while performing on a regular basis at the Whisky a Go Go nightclub in West Hollywood that the band got exposure to more famous musical artists of the time. Subsequently, they were the opening act for Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. As related to group biographer, William James Ruhlmann, by Walt Parazaider, Jimi Hendrix once told Parazaider, \\"'Jeez, your horn players are like one set of lungs and your guitar player is better than me.'\\" Their first record (April 1969), the eponymous Chicago Transit Authority, is a double album, which is rare for a band's first release. The album made it to No. 17 on the Billboard 200 album chart, sold over one million copies by 1970, and was awarded a platinum disc. The album included a number of pop-rock songs - \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\", \\"Beginnings\\", \\"Questions 67 and 68\\", and \\"I'm a Man\\" - which were later released as singles. For this inaugural recording effort the group was nominated for a Grammy Award for 1969 Best New Artist of the Year. According to Peter Cetera, the band was booked to perform at Woodstock in 1969, but promoter Bill Graham, with whom they had a contract, exercised his right to reschedule them to play at the Fillmore West on a date of his choosing, and he scheduled them for the Woodstock dates. Santana, which Graham also managed, took Chicago's place at Woodstock, and that performance is considered to be Santana's \\"breakthrough\\" gig. A year later, in 1970, when he needed to replace headliner Joe Cocker, and then Cocker's intended replacement, Jimi Hendrix, Graham booked Chicago to perform at Tanglewood which is considered by some to be a \\"pinnacle\\" performance. After the release of their first album, the band's name was shortened to Chicago to avoid legal action being threatened by the actual mass-transit company of the same name.","completion":"This text is about the American rock band, Chicago."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] Now, I have a new situation: The marine biologists studied two areas of the Black Sea. Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated. Answer this question please: Which of the two areas had more phytoplankton? A:","completion":"Area B, situated 35 miles south where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated, likely had more phytoplankton. This is because lower stratification allows for more mixing of nutrients between layers, which can lead to higher primary production and an increased abundance of phytoplankton. In contrast, the high levels of water stratification in Area A hamper nutrient mixing, potentially limiting the growth of phytoplankton due to nutrient availability."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What organism did Mendel study? Context: The existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.

It ran OK (if somewhat underpowered) until about October of 2007, then quit. The manufacturer won't do anything about it - I believe that a ninety-nine dollar fan should last longer than this one did, or have a robust enough warranty to cover it when it doesn't. Don't waste your money - it's a piece of junk. Is this product review negative? Select from: A). Yes. B). No. A:","completion":"This product review is indeed negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the Windchaser Wall/Ceiling fan they purchased in 2006. They have outlined several reasons for their negative review, such as the fan being underpowered, not lasting as long as they believe it should have, and the manufacturer's refusal to provide assistance or support when the fan stopped working. Additionally, the reviewer specifically advises potential customers not to waste their money on this product, as they perceive it to be of low quality. Firstly, the reviewer states that the fan was underpowered, which suggests that it did not meet their performance expectations. This can be considered a negative aspect of the product since it may have been unable to provide adequate airflow or cooling for the reviewer's needs. Secondly, the lifespan of the product is a significant area of concern for the reviewer. The fan they purchased stopped functioning after just over a year of usage, which the reviewer considers to be insufficient for a product in this price range. Had the fan lasted longer, the reviewer might have been more forgiving and rated the product more favorably. Lastly, the manufacturer's lack of support or willingness to address the issue adds to the negative tone of the review. The reviewer had hoped for a warranty or some form of assistance from the manufacturer when their fan stopped working, but they were left disappointed. This sheds a negative light not only on the product but also on the company that produced it. In conclusion, the reviewer's experience with the Windchaser Wall/Ceiling fan was thoroughly negative, marked by subpar performance, a short lifespan, and inadequate customer support from the manufacturer. Potential customers reading this review may be strongly dissuaded from purchasing this product based on the reviewer's experience and clear disappointment. Therefore, the correct answer is A). Yes, this product review is negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The tweet begins with the user expressing the physical warmth in their room, which can be interpreted as a way to share their current state of comfort or discomfort, potentially impacting their mood. This warmth could also be metaphorical, signifying that the tweeter feels a positive, welcoming atmosphere, befitting the context of a birthday celebration. The mention of the birthday in 8 hours reveals a sense of excitement, as birthdays are typically associated with joy, celebration, and an appreciation for life. The user is looking forward to this milestone and is likely anticipating the well-wishes, gifts, and company of friends and family. This sense of anticipation is further strengthened by the specific mention of the time remaining until their birthday, suggesting that the user is eager for the event to arrive. In contrast to the excitement surrounding their birthday, the mention of an exam in approximately 22 hours introduces a mildly concerning undertone. Exams are often associated with stress, hard work, and evaluation, which can trigger anxiety and pressure to perform well. The user's casual approach to mentioning the exam amidst their birthday excitement could signify a desire to keep things in perspective and not allow the upcoming exam to overshadow their special day. The combination of the upcoming birthday and exam presents a sense of feeling overwhelmed, as the user may face the challenge of striking a balance between celebrating their birthday and preparing for the exam.

The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \\"Best Bed Chamber\\".

The number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the beginning of the 1900s. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance. Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals. An important question is, \\"do invasive species cause extinctions?\\" Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives, but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: alpha diversity) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: beta diversity). Overall gamma diversity may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes, but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. Extirpation, population decline, and homogenization of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers, by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What invaders are causing changes in the Great Lakes region?","completion":"The question can be answered: Some of the invaders causing changes in the Great Lakes region include zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), and sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: To tell if you experience frustration that falls outside the normal range, answer these questions. You might find that your frustration is extreme, and if that’s the case, seeking therapy or anger management classes might be a valuable option. Are you usually irritable? Do you normally respond to frustration by blaming or snapping at others? Do you self-medicate letdowns with alcohol, drugs and excessive eating? Do you often hurt others’ feelings when you are responding to frustration? Do you tend to feel misunderstood after a bout of frustration has passed? Do you often lose your cool in the middle of a hard day of work or school? When you get disappointed, do you feel as though life is impossible or that you are unworthy? Spend some time thinking or writing about the potential sources of frustration in your life. Be as specific as possible about what triggers your frustration--maybe it's a co-worker or classmate you find frustrating or even the way that someone says or does something. Try to consider whether or not this source of frustration is something that you want to control and cannot. For example, you cannot control another person's point of view. But, you can control whether or not you engage this person in conversation. Doing this will help you understand and accept these things in the long-term, making you more capable of handling them with patience. Alternately, you might find that you can avoid certain frustrations entirely. For example, if you take a slow, traffic-heavy route home from work, you could opt for a slightly longer route that allows you to avoid it. Frustration is not always misplaced, and it may be a reasonable response to a very real and difficult issue or issues in your life. However, frustration can build if you believe that every problem has a clear solution and there's something wrong with you or with your life for not being able to arrive at it. Instead of trying to solve a difficulty once and for all, try to focus on cultivating a helpful attitude toward it. Understand why it exists in your life and be open to facing and learning from it. Understanding that the source of frustration may not be clear-cut will keep you open to handling your frustration without acting from it. For example, you might think twice before quitting your office job just because the printer keeps jamming. Timing is everything, especially when it comes to warding off frustration. It’s often the case that we are faced with something that you’re capable of handling—just not right now. Spend time noticing your energy shifts throughout the day. You might notice, for example, that most mornings tend to be a great time to handle serious issues, but in the afternoons you feel too tired to face bills or make big decisions. Avoid frustration by only doing these things when you know you have the energy level to conquer the task. Having several routines that you can use to make daily life less impacted with in-the-moment decisions. This reduces frustration by eliminating how much newness you must cope with regularly. Especially if your usual sources of frustration are managing daily tasks, running late, or not having enough time in your day, try sticking to a schedule. Use the things that you must \\"show up\\" for, like coming into the office or picking up your child from school as anchors. Then, you can plan things like paying bills, buying groceries, and enjoying a morning workout routine around these commitments. Don't stress yourself out trying to schedule everything. Instead, organize few hour blocks of the day that are normally unstructured to make these times run more smoothly. You will be less frustrated by little inconveniences like traffic or hassle at the bank knowing that you are making efforts to allot time for these duties. Frustration is also caused by trying to manipulate and change things that don’t matter much in the first place. When you are about to fly off the handle or request or make a change to get things a little more “how you prefer it”, ask yourself if it will matter tomorrow (or next week, or next year). Chances are the situation is something you can let go of and forget about. You may want to also ask yourself if you care deeply about the frustrating situation. If it is not somehow linked to your deeper values, you may be trying to get your way just for the sake of it. When this is the case, have a little laugh at yourself and let it go. In moments of frustration, remember it is not just you who are bearing the brunt of the negative thoughts and judgments; those around you also risk getting caught in the middle of your mood. If you're in a conversation in a moment of frustration, try slowing down and thinking through your words. Ask yourself if the first thing that comes to mind, for example, \\"why are you so incompetent?\\", is a helpful thing to say. Remarks like these only make frustration mount and spread. Listen closely to what the other person is saying, and try to get a sense of where they are coming from. Take this into account when you answer, choosing to be understanding rather than making a quick judgment. For example, if you are frustrated that your roommates never wash the dishes, approach them wondering, without judgment, whether or not they are aware of this shared responsibility and whether or not something is blocking their ability to help. This will make negotiation much more peaceful than accusing them of being lazy slobs (as your frustration may tell you they are). If the peace of acceptance does not come easily—and this does take time to cultivate—go ahead and release your frustration in a way that will not harm yourself or others. Yell into your pillow or punch it until you get tired. Sometimes frustration is more effectively dealt with by expressing anger instead of trying to soothe it. So, trust that your frustration will pass by simply letting it out rather than trying to manipulate or intervene on the frustrating situation itself. Do this when the frustration is ongoing, or there's little you can do to change the frustrating situation. Make sure that you are in a place where others won't be intimidated or frightened by your release.

Possible A: sound well, fly, become broken, gain speed, fall into hole Why is \\"gain speed\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Gain speed\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense due to several factors rooted in our understanding of the physical world and the laws that govern it. When examining the given scenario, a round object rolling down a ramp, we can analyze different aspects, such as the object's shape, as well as the incline and surface of the ramp, which all contribute to the object gaining speed. The basic principles of motion, gravity, and friction can help elucidate why \\"gain speed\\" is the most logical and sensible answer when compared to the other options provided. 1. Principles of motion: According to Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion, particularly the first law (the law of inertia), an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move in a straight line with constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. In this case, gravity and the inclined plane provide the external forces necessary to set the round object into motion and alter its velocity. 2. Gravity: Gravity is a natural force that attracts two objects with mass toward each other. In the context of our scenario, gravity pulls the round object downwards, causing it to accelerate along the incline of the ramp. The gravitational force provides the means for the object to change its velocity (i.e., gain speed) as it rolls down the ramp. 3. Round shape: A round object, such as a ball or a wheel, has a property called rotational inertia that allows it to roll smoothly and easily along surfaces. This property minimizes friction and other resistive forces, allowing the object to maintain or increase its speed as it moves. Additionally, round objects have no corners or edges that would create drag or limit the effectiveness of the motion down the ramp. 4. Inclined plane: The inclined plane of the ramp serves as a key factor in the round object gaining speed. From a human common sense standpoint, a ramp provides a slope that makes it easier for objects to move downwards due to gravity. This is in contrast to a flat or uphill surface, which does not facilitate the same acceleration effect. The steeper the incline, the greater the rate at which the round object will gain speed. 5. Friction: The natural force of friction interacts between the round object and the ramp's surface, opposing the object's motion. However, the object's round shape and the inclined plane typically allow it to overcome this resistive force and gain speed more effectively than if it had a different shape or were on a flat surface. Comparing this to the other given answers, \\"sound well\\" is not relevant to the situation, as it pertains to audio, not movement. \\"Fly\\" suggests that the round object would become airborne, which isn't a typical or expected outcome in this scenario. \\"Become broken\\" implies that the rolling movement would damage the object, which, unless the object is extremely fragile or there is some external force, is not necessarily true in all circumstances, while \\"fall into a hole\\" assumes the presence of a hole, which is not explicitly mentioned in the scenario. Hence, taking into account the principles of motion, gravity, the object's shape, and the inclined plane, \\"gain speed\\" is the answer most closely aligned with human common sense. It corresponds to our everyday experience and understanding of how round objects behave when they roll down inclined surfaces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira’s origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. Question: \\"Who was fortunate enough to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around?\\" Answer: \\"Genovese\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Options are: A. no B. yes","completion":"Answer: A. no The answer \\"Genovese\\" is incorrect because it was not Genovese who was fortunate enough to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Instead, it was João Gonçalves Zarco who managed to land on the beach of Porto Santo, which he later named Porto Santo (Holy Port). The Genovese maps mentioned in the paragraph depict Madeira and Porto Santo but do not directly relate to the event of landing on the beach."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Facts: - death place: new york city , new york , u.s. - relatives: george the yale university press benjamin henry day , jr. -lrb- parmly uncle -rrb- benjamin day -lrb- grandfather -rrb- day -lrb- brother -rrb- , founder of - other names: b. h. arkwright - known for: '' -lrb- 1920 -rrb- the story of the yale university press '' - birth name: clarence shepard day , jr. . - death date: 28 december 1935 - children: wendy day - birth date: 18 november 1874 - name: clarence day - nationality: american - parents: clarence shepard day -lrb- 1844-1927 -rrb- - birth place: new york city , new york , u.s.

Article: Two men dressed as police officers stole about 200 million worth of art from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum early this morning. The two burglars knocked on a side door of the museum at about 1:15 am. They told the two security guards on duty that there was a disturbance in the area. The guards then made the very serious mistake of allowing the two men to go into the building. After they went in, the two burglars tied the guards up with tape. The two men stole 11 paintings and an ancient Chinese vase. The stolen works included three paintings by Rembrandt. A maintenance worker discovered the two guards at about 7 am and called police. One of the greatest losses was Rembrandt's works, \\"The Storm on the Sea of Galilee.\\" It was a very popular attraction at the museum and was one of the most valuable works stolen. Museum officials said that the value of the stolen art is at least 200 million dollars, and may in fact be much more. The true value of the paintings is unknown, because they have not been on the market for nearly a century. This is considered to be the biggest theft ever in the United States. Officials are waiting to see whether the burglars will or try to sell them to a private collector. Museum officials and police are not sure why the burglars chose certain works and not others. There are other paintings in the museum that are even more valuable than the ones that were stolen. Special investigators are looking into the theft and the museum's security system. They believe that this is a \\"professional job,\\" because the people involved were well prepared and knew what they wanted.

Q: Review: This is one of the worst movies i've ever encountered, but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be unwarranted..As far as pure film-making technique goes, this director is competent. He's held back by the limited budget and the VHS camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional. i've seen many movies where the \\"directing\\" was much worse. At least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there. Also, the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere. There is only so much you can do with a VHS camera, and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go. As far as artistic merit, there is none. The scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film. This is pure trash... Total garbage.The gore is decent for a film in this budget range. , it's obviously fake but there's lot's of it, and it's very outlandish..I saw the American version with the intentionally campy dubbing. This was a good idea (and it's the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film)...

In the first sentence, we learn that Lucy has a dream of flying over the ocean. In order to fulfill her dream, she decides to take a plane. However, the paragraph mentions that she \\"couldn't feel the wind and was disappointed.\\" Since disappointment is a negative emotion, it can be inferred that Lucy didn't enjoy her time in the plane. To address her disappointment, Lucy chooses to go to the beach and try parasailing instead. When she finally experiences the sensation of being five hundred feet above the ocean and feeling the wind, she becomes \\"very happy.\\" This happiness suggests that her dream of flying has been fulfilled in a way that the plane experience did not provide, further confirming that Lucy did not enjoy her time in the plane.

The best way to avoid sexually transmitted infections and/or pregnancy is by delaying or avoiding sexual activity. But if you do not want to wait, be safe and use a condom every time that you have sex. It is a common myth that you cannot become pregnant or contract an STI the first time you have sex. You can become pregnant or infected with an STI any time that you have sex, so it is crucial to protect yourself. When used every time and in the right way, condoms are very effective in preventing STIs. If your partner protests using condoms, do not give in to the pressure. Make it clear that you are not interested in a sexual relationship unless it is a safe one. You may also consider getting a vaccine to prevent HPV, which is the virus that causes genital warts and cervical cancer. Talk to your doctor about HPV vaccines like Gardasil and Cervarix. Birth control pills alone will not prevent against sexually transmitted infection, but using birth control pills as well as a condom can reduce your risk of pregnancy even further. Condoms are 82% effective against pregnancy, while birth control pills are 91% effective against pregnancy. Therefore, using condoms and birth control pills together can reduce your chances of becoming pregnant even further while still helping to protect you from STIs. The first time can be very stressful, so you might benefit from doing some stress reduction exercises before you get started. Try taking long, deep breaths to calm yourself before you have sex. Remember that everyone is a little nervous the first time, so there is nothing abnormal about feeling this way. Part of what makes sex fun is the foreplay and romance. Take your time and enjoy the moment. Don’t feel like you need to race to finish. Just take your time and enjoy the experience. Try setting a romantic mood by playing some soft music, dimming the lights, and talking for a bit before you start. If you are not enjoying the experience at any point, you should tell your partner. Likewise, if your partner asks you to stop at any time, stop. Sometimes sex can be painful the first time, which is normal. But if you are just not enjoying yourself, it is important to let your partner know so that you can adjust your position or decide to try again some other time. Although movies and TV might make sex seem like a glamorous, romantic experience, it can actually be very awkward. The first time may be especially awkward because it is such a new experience for you. Just keep in mind that this awkwardness is normal and you should not feel embarrassed or ashamed about it. After the sex is over and you have time to think and process the experience, you might begin to feel some emotions that are new to you. It is normal to feel strange after your first sexual experience with someone. If you have trouble coping with these emotions, discuss them with someone you trust, such as a parent, counselor, or close friend. There are a lot of steps between holding hands and having sex. If it feels like your relationship with your partner is progressing too quickly, try to slow it down with other intimate acts first that don't require sex, such as kissing, petting around, and hugging intimately. You can also talk about sex, marriage, or children, which can stimulate some people. Be affectionate in a way that makes both of you feel more comfortable with the another.","completion":"To ensure a safe and enjoyable first-time sexual experience, use condoms and birth control to protect against STIs and pregnancy, communicate with your partner, set a romantic mood, and take your time, while also seeking guidance, discussing feelings, and exploring other intimate acts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If turbines are used to producing electricity, then turbines are used to what? Answer choices: - direct energy - Metling snow - run a car - produce electricity - kinetic energy - chop trees - lift heavy objects - enormous damage to homes Answer:","completion":"Turbines are primarily used to produce electricity. A turbine is a mechanical device that converts kinetic energy from a moving fluid, such as water, steam, or wind, into mechanical energy which can then be used to generate electrical energy when connected to a generator. The energy conversion is based on the principles of fluid dynamics and the laws of thermodynamics. While some of the other options provided are not directly related to the primary purpose of a turbine, they are indirectly related in the sense that the energy produced by a turbine can be used in various applications. Here is a breakdown of how turbines relate to the other options presented: - Direct energy: Turbines can be considered as devices that facilitate the direct conversion of kinetic energy from a moving fluid into electricity. This electrical energy can then be used for various purposes, such as powering homes, businesses, and industries. - Melting snow: Although turbines are not specifically designed to melt snow, the electricity generated by them can be used to power devices that can melt snow, such as heated pavement systems or electric snow-melting mats. - Run a car: Although turbines themselves do not directly run a car, the electricity produced by turbines can be used to charge electric vehicles. Additionally, gas turbines engines, also known as jet engines, are used to power certain types of high-performance vehicles and military aircraft. - Kinetic energy: As previously mentioned, turbines work by converting kinetic energy from a moving fluid into mechanical energy, which is then used to generate electrical energy. - Chop trees: Turbines are not designed to chop trees. However, the electricity generated by a turbine could be used to power devices that can chop trees, such as electric saws or other wood-processing equipment. - Lift heavy objects: Turbines are not used to lift heavy objects. However, the electrical energy produced by turbines can power devices that lift heavy objects, such as cranes or other heavy machinery. - Enormous damage to homes: Turbines themselves do not cause any direct damage to homes. However, there have been instances where turbines' improper installations or extreme weather events, such as tornadoes or hurricanes, have resulted in turbine-related damage. In summary, the primary purpose of turbines is to produce electricity by converting kinetic energy from a moving fluid into mechanical and eventually electrical energy. Although they are not directly involved in the other presented options, the electrical energy they produce can be utilized across a wide range of applications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: New York City police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is investigating the murder of a beautiful and highly successful advertising executive, Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). Laura has apparently been killed by a shotgun blast to the face, just inside the doorway of her apartment. He first interviews charismatic newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), an imperious, effete dandy, who relates how he met Laura and became her mentor. She had become his platonic friend and steady companion and he used his considerable fame, influence, and connections to advance her career. McPherson also questions Laura's parasitic playboy fiancÃ©, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a \\"kept man\\" and companion of her wealthy socialite aunt, Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson). Treadwell is tolerant of her niece's infatuation with Shelby, which appears to be out of her practical acceptance of Shelby's need for the affection of a woman who is his own age. All the while, Treadwell is carrying on with Carpenter and giving him money. Detective McPherson finally questions Laura's loyal housekeeper, Bessie Clary (Dorothy Adams). Through the testimony of her friends, and the reading of her letters and diary, McPherson becomes obsessed with Laura, so much so that Lydecker finally accuses him of falling in love with the dead woman. He also learns that Lydecker was jealous of Laura's suitors, using his newspaper column and influence to keep them at bay. One night, the detective falls asleep in Laura's apartment, under her portrait, and is awakened by the sound of someone entering the apartment. He is shocked to discover it is Laura, who finds a dress in her closet belonging to one of her models, Diane Redfern.

Next question: who has the longest sellout streak in sports?","completion":"The team with the longest sellout streak in sports is the Boston Red Sox, a Major League Baseball (MLB) team based in Boston, Massachusetts. This legendary sellout streak took place at Fenway Park, one of the most iconic and oldest ballparks in the United States. The Boston Red Sox's sellout streak began on May 15, 2003, and lasted for a remarkable 820 consecutive home games. This phenomenal streak persisted for nearly a decade before it eventually came to an end on April 10, 2013. During this impressive period, the Red Sox managed to secure three World Series championships (in 2004, 2007, and 2013), contributing to the team's popularity and fan support. Fenway Park itself is an intimate and historic venue with a seating capacity of around 37,700 spectators, which has been consistently expanded and developed since it first opened in 1912. The charm and unique atmosphere of the ballpark played a significant role in maintaining the sellout streak, as fans eagerly filled the park game after game. Fenway is well-known for its idiosyncrasies, such as the Green Monster, a 37-foot-tall left-field wall, and the Pesky Pole, a right-field foul pole positioned unusually close to the plate. The sellout streak was a testament to the dedication and loyalty of the Red Sox fans, who consistently supported their team through both triumphant and challenging seasons. Throughout this streak, the fans welcomed star players such as David Ortiz, Pedro Martinez, Manny Ramirez, and Dustin Pedroia. The Red Sox players, in turn, rose to the occasion by performing at a high level, which contributed to the sustained interest in the games and the fans' eagerness to pack the stands. Various promotional events and activities further contributed to the high attendance during the sellout streak. These included themed nights, bobblehead giveaways, and special event days, as well as the increased adoption of dynamic ticket pricing strategies, which allowed the organization to maximize revenue and incentivize attendance even for less popular games. In conclusion, the Boston Red Sox boast the longest sellout streak in sports history, spanning 820 consecutive home games from May 15, 2003, to April 10, 2013. This remarkable achievement is greatly attributed to the loyal fanbase, the exceptional performance of star players, the intimate and historic Fenway Park, and the dynamic ticket pricing and promotional strategies employed by the Red Sox organization. The streak will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the most impressive and enduring records in professional sports."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Image copyright Moscow District Military Court/TASS Image caption Sergei Skripal was exposed to a nerve agent from the Novichok group in Salisbury Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal has been discharged from hospital, two months after being poisoned with a nerve agent in Salisbury. The 66-year-old was found slumped on a park bench in the city on 4 March, with his daughter Yulia. They were taken to Salisbury District Hospital's intensive care unit, where they were stabilised after being exposed to Novichok. Ms Skripal was released on 9 April and was moved to a secure location. It is not known whether Mr Skripal has been taken to the same location as his daughter. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said he understood that Mr Skripal is able to walk, and has talked to police at length, but is not completely recovered. He said police sources indicated that the investigation could take months of carefully piecing together movements of people and cars from mobile phone records, CCTV, automatic number plate recognition and passenger flight records. The Metropolitan Police said its investigation into the attack continued and it would not \\"be discussing any protective or security arrangements that are in place\\". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC Rewind looks back at cases of high-profile Russians targeted on foreign soil Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said treating the Skripals had been \\"a huge and unprecedented challenge\\". She added: \\"This is an important stage in his recovery, which will now take place away from the hospital.\\" Russian ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenko welcomed the news that Mr Skripal had been discharged, and repeated his demand for consular access to the former spy and his daughter. At a news conference at his official residence in London, Mr Yakovenko said: \\"We are happy that he is all right.\\" The Russian ambassador has previously claimed the UK is violating international law by not granting access to the Skripals. \\"If they don't want our assistance, that's fine, but we want to see them physically,\\" he said. Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats in response to the attack in Salisbury, but Mr Yakovenko and others remain. DS Nick Bailey - the police officer who first attended the Skripals on the day of the poisoning - was also treated for exposure to the nerve agent, but was discharged in March. Clinicians at the hospital had to keep the Skripals alive while their bodies could produce more enzymes to replace those that had been poisoned. Analysis By Leila Nathoo, BBC News home affairs correspondent When Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were left in a critical condition, it seemed improbable that the two would survive. Now, less than three months on, both have been discharged from hospital. Their personal safety will be a priority for the police - the two have been taken to a secure location. Detectives are continuing to investigate the attempted murder of the Skripals, though so far no suspects have been named. They will have spoken at length to both Sergei and Yulia about what happened and why they may have been targeted. But police say they are still working to establish the full facts of the attack. The UK government has blamed Russia for the attack, with Prime Minister Theresa May describing the incident as \\"brazen\\" and \\"despicable\\". But the Russian government denied any involvement and has accused the UK of inventing a \\"fake story\\". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is due to speak at a conference in Paris on Friday intended to fight against impunity for the use of chemical weapons. Speaking before the conference, he said: \\"Assad's brutality in Syria and the attempted murders in Salisbury pose a grave threat to the Chemical Weapons Convention and to the rules-based order that keeps us all safe.\\" Image caption Yulia and Sergei Skripal were taken to Salisbury District Hospital after being found slumped on a bench In 2006 Mr Skripal, a former Russian colonel, was jailed in Russia for 13 years for passing on the identities of Russian spies in Europe to the UK intelligence services. But in 2010 he was part of a prisoner swap between Moscow and the United States. He eventually settled in Salisbury. When Ms Skripal was released she refused assistance from the Russian embassy, who claim they had been denied consular access to a Russian national. Recently the director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, publicly blamed Russia for the \\"reckless\\" poisoning, accusing the Kremlin of \\"flagrant breaches of international rules\\". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Specialist officers in protective suits retrieved samples from multiple sites in Salisbury The investigation into the nerve agent attack saw the closure of areas of Salisbury, as police and specialist investigators identified where the Skripals were poisoned. The highest concentration of the Novichok was found at the Skripals' front door. A multimillion pound operation to decontaminate nine locations in the city is under way. Two places that the Skripals visited - the Mill pub and a Zizzi restaurant - are among the places deemed to be still at risk. ||||| Russia demands access to poisoned former spy and daughter to ensure they do not want help Moscow has demanded a meeting with Sergei Skripal, the Russian former spy poisoned by a nerve agent in Salisbury, following his discharge from hospital. Vladimir Putin said he was pleased Skripal had been released from hospital on Friday, more than 10 weeks after the poisoning, and wished him well. “God grant him good health,” the Russian president said. “If a military-grade poison had been used, the man would have died on the spot. Thank God he recovered and that he left [hospital].” Russia’s ambassador to London, Alexander Yakovenko, also welcomed Skripal’s release, but claimed the UK would be breaking international law if it did not allow access to him and his daughter, Yulia, who was also poisoned and was discharged last month. Almost 100 police have received psychological help after Salisbury attack Read more Yakovenko said nobody actually knew if the pair were alive and suggested that, if they were, they may have already left the country. Scotland Yard made clear that no details of the security arrangements for the pair would be given. Salisbury district hospital announced on Friday morning that Skripal had been discharged. The chief executive, Cara Charles-Barks, said it was good news that Skripal was well enough to be discharged. “That he, Yulia and DS [Nick] Bailey have been able to leave us so soon after coming into contact with this nerve agent is thanks to the hard work, skill and professionalism of our clinicians, who provide outstanding care to all our patients, day in and day out,” she said. “This has been a difficult time for those caught up in this incident: the patients, our staff and the people of Salisbury. I want to thank the public for their support, and I want to pay a special tribute to both the clinical staff here at the trust and those who work so hard behind the scenes. They’ve demonstrated the very best of the NHS.” Quick guide What is novichok? Show Hide Novichok refers to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 80s to elude international restrictions on chemical weapons. Like other nerve agents, they are organophosphate compounds, but the chemicals used to make them, and their final structures, are considered classified in the UK, the US and other countries. The most potent of the novichok substances are considered to be more lethal than VX, the most deadly of the familiar nerve agents, which include sarin, tabun and soman. While the novichok agents work in a similar way, by massively over-stimulating muscles and glands, one chemical weapons expert said the agents did not degrade fast in the environment and had 'an additional toxicity that was not well understood. Treatment for novichok exposure would be the same as for other nerve agents, namely with atropine, diazepam and potentially drugs called oximes. The chemical structures of novichok agents were made public in 2008 by Vil Mirzayanov, a former Russian scientist living in the US, but the structures have never been publicly confirmed. It is thought they can be made in different forms, including as a dust aerosol. The novichoks are known as binary agents because they only become lethal after mixing two otherwise harmless components. According to Mirzayanov, they are 10 to 100 times more toxic than conventional nerve agents. While laboratories that are used to police chemical weapons incidents have databases of nerve agents, few outside Russia are believed to have full details of the novichok compounds and the chemicals needed to make them. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images Europe The hospital added: “While these patients have now been discharged, their right to patient confidentiality remains and limits us from giving detailed accounts of the treatment these individuals received. “However, treating people who are so acutely unwell, having been poisoned by nerve agents, requires stabilising them, keeping them alive until their bodies could produce more enzymes to replace those that had been poisoned.” At a press conference at his official residence in London, Yakovenko said Russia wanted access to the Skripals “just to understand how they feel and for them to say personally what they want. We are not asking for anything extraordinary. We are asking for the UK to comply with the law.” He said: “It is not just a question of our bilateral relations but international law through the Vienna convention 1965. “Nobody has seen their pictures, heard their voice and whether they are alive. It is fine for us if they say they do not want our services.” He said he had the impression, based on conversations with UK security services “that we will never see them”, and called on the British press “to be a bit more active and ask to see them. They may not be in this country.” Yakovenko said the reputations of both the UK and Russia were at stake due to the British allegation that Moscow was responsible for the poisonings. “We do not have any official version of what happened. We do not have any access to the investigation. We have to rely on press leaks,” he said. Russia has requested consular access to Yulia Skripal twice since her recovery. Britain told Russia formally she had chosen not to take up its offer of help, but Yakovenko said she was isolated, and Russia required personal assurances from her that she did not want its help. The ambassador said he had never heard of Sergei Skripal prior to his poisoning. A UK government spokesman said it was very welcome news that hospital staff have deemed Sergei Skripal well enough to be discharged from hospital. “As medical experts have been clear, Mr Skripal will need ongoing care,” he added. “Mr Skripal, his daughter Yulia and DS Nick Bailey all received outstanding care at Salisbury district hospital. “Their ongoing recovery is testament to the hardworking and talented NHS staff, who have also continued to serve their community so well during this period - and will carry on doing so. “But let’s not forget, the fact that all three victims of this incident have been discharged from hospital does not alter the fact this was a brazen and reckless attack - attempted murder - using an illegal chemical weapon.” Counter-terrorism police, who continue to lead the criminal investigation, said they would not be discussing the security arrangements for the Skripals. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: “This is a complex investigation and detectives continue to gather and piece together all the evidence to establish the full facts and circumstances behind this dreadful attack. In the interests of Sergei and Yulia’s safety, we will not be discussing any protective or security arrangements that are in place.” The Skripals collapsed on a park bench in Salisbury on 4 March after being exposed to novichok, most likely at Sergei’s home on the outskirts of the city. Later that month, a high court judgment emerged suggesting they had little chance of recovery. The judgment from Mr Justice Williams said: “… medical tests indicate that their mental capacity might be compromised to an unknown and so far unascertained degree”. Williams said Sergei Skripal was unable to communicate at all and his daughter could not communicate in any meaningful way. “It is not possible to say when or to what extent Mr or Ms Skripal may regain capacity. Both are currently in a physically stable condition which is not expected to change in the immediate or near future.” However, their recovery appears to have been helped by the proximity of the hospital to the defence research laboratory at Porton Down. Yulia Skripal’s faster recovery could have been because she suffered less exposure to the nerve agent or because she is younger and fitter than her father. Bailey, who was poisoned when attending the pair, was released three weeks before Yulia Skripal. He said at the time that he did not expect “normal life” to resume. It will be the same for the Skripals, who will be offered protection for the rest of their lives. There have been reports that they may be granted settled status in another country, such as the US or Australia, though the Russian embassy has claimed this would amount to abduction or forced isolation. Meanwhile, Skripal’s home remains a sealed-off crime scene and decontamination work at sites linked to the attack is continuing. ||||| PRAGUE — The aging Russian spy had been a free man for only a few years when he turned up in Prague for a secret meeting with his former adversaries. He looked ill, but acted jovial, drinking with his Czech hosts and joking that his doctor had prescribed whiskey for high blood pressure. Then he got down to business, rattling off information about Russian spycraft and the activities of former colleagues that might give the Czechs an edge over their foes. This was Sergei V. Skripal, the former Russian spy who along with his daughter was nearly poisoned to death with a rare and toxic nerve agent 10 weeks ago, touching off a furious confrontation between Russia and the West that has played out like a Cold War thriller and led to the expulsion of more than 150 Russian diplomats from more than two dozen countries. The British authorities have accused Russia of trying to assassinate Mr. Skripal, a charge the Russians angrily deny. One of Britain’s highest ranking spymasters, the MI5 chief, Andrew Parker, lambasted Russia on Monday in a speech to security chiefs in Berlin, accusing the Kremlin of “barefaced lying” and “criminal thuggery,” and warning Russia that it risked becoming a “more isolated pariah.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a dangerous nerve agent called Novichok. They were found on a park bench in Salisbury, England and taken to a hospital. Both Sergei and Yulia have now been released from the hospital, but they're still recovering. This event caused a big argument between Russia and other countries like the United Kingdom and the United States. Many people think Russia tried to hurt Sergei Skripal on purpose, but Russia says it didn't do it. So far, nobody knows exactly what happened or who did it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Some Skin Cancer Survivors Still Use Tanning Beds Say it isn’t so. A recent survey found that even people who have survived melanoma — the deadliest form of skin cancer — fail to protect themselves from the sun, and even continue to tan. Fortunately, they do protect themselves more than the average person, but researchers from Yale University found that among people with a history of melanoma, 27.3% reported never using sunscreen when in the sun, despite the fact that these lotions can protect against ultraviolet rays that increase the risk of cancer. MORE: In Young Tanners, Fear of Wrinkling Is Worse than Cancer Additionally, 15.4% melanoma survivors said they never or rarely stayed in the shade and 2.1% had even been to a tanning salon in the previous year. “That blew my mind,” said study author Dr. Anees Chagpar of Yale University to the Los Angeles Times. Chagpar presented the data at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Washington, D.C. The researchers looked at data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey, which asked 27,000 participants a variety of questions related to health practices, like sun care. Among the volunteers, 171 had a history of melanoma. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, the skin cancer kills about 8,790 people each year, and The National Cancer Institute estimates there will be 76,690 new cases and 9,480 deaths from the disease in 2013. (MORE: Study Finds Dramatic Rise in Skin Cancer Among Young Adults) Melanoma survivors did take better care of their skin compared to the general population; more of the cancer patients than those not affected by the disease stayed in the shade and used sunscreen. But Chagpar says that isn’t enough to properly protect these survivors from recurrent growths. “Overall, melanoma survivors did take more precautions against melanoma than the general population,” Chagpar told MedPage Today. ”Still, these results are really depressing. So much more could be done to protect against a recurrence of this deadly skin cancer.” The results are especially worrisome given recent studies that documented rising rates of melanoma, especially among teens, who are also most likely to engage in behaviors that put them at risk of the cancer. Last spring, a Mayo Clinic study reported that between 1970 and 2009, the incidence of melanoma increased eightfold among young women and fourfold among young men ages 18 to 39. Driving some of the rise is the popularity of indoor tanning, despite the fact that in 2009 the International Agency of Research on Cancer declared tanning beds a human carcinogen, and moved them into the top cancer-risk category, along with cigarettes. (MORE: Fake Tans Help Keep Women Out of the Sun) Although the study found that skin cancer survivors may be more vigilant about their skin health than those not affected by melanoma, the findings highlight the importance of keeping cancer survivors compliant in protecting their skin, even long after the scare of the cancer has faded. As experts noted in USA Today: Several previous studies have suggested such vigilance is hard to maintain, though some studies do find better compliance than the latest survey does, says Mary Tripp, a behavior researcher at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. A possible weakness of the new survey, which has not yet been published, is that it relies on self-reported medical histories, which are sometimes inaccurate, she says. But she says she has interviewed melanoma survivors who have let down their guard. “When someone is first diagnosed, they are practicing sun protection, but as the years go by, maybe they tend to fall back on their old habits,” she says. “A lot of melanoma survivors have told me that it is very important for them to maintain a normal outdoor lifestyle.” Remaining vigilant about protecting skin is critical to improving survival from melanoma. The good news is that while melanoma rates have been increasing over recent years, mortality rates have improved. More early-detection methods as well and quick and efficient medical treatments are likely responsible. But reducing exposure to cancer triggers can also contribute to the trend. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"A recent survey found that some skin cancer survivors continue to use tanning beds and fail to protect themselves from the sun, despite the increased risk of cancer recurrence.

The hurricane was first reported on September 8 off the coast of Mexico. It slowly moved northwestward while intensifying. After peaking in intensity, it entered the Gulf of California, and weakened rapidly. It dissipated on September 13. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The 1941 Cabo San Lucas hurricane was a category 4 storm","completion":"Yes, given the information provided about the 1941 Cabo San Lucas hurricane being one of the worst tropical cyclones on record to affect the region, it would follow that it was a powerful storm. While the original text does not explicitly mention the storm's category, it does imply that the hurricane was strong and destructive. A Category 4 hurricane, on the Saffir-Simpson scale, is considered a major hurricane, with sustained wind speeds between 130-156 mph (209-251 km/h). This level of intensity typically results in catastrophic damage to the areas it impacts, such as Cabo San Lucas in 1941. The fact that the hurricane intensified as it moved slowly northwestward further supports the likelihood that it reached Category 4 status. The hurricane's lifespan from September 8 to 13 also demonstrates its ability to maintain its power for an extended period, which aligns with a storm of higher classification. In addition, its rapid weakening as it entered the Gulf of California suggests that it had reached its peak intensity beforehand, which could have been at a Category 4 level. Although the statement \\"The 1941 Cabo San Lucas hurricane was a Category 4 storm\\" is not directly taken from the provided text, it is a reasonable inference based on the information given about the hurricane's intensity, trajectory, and consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules.

He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create.

Q:The answer to the question: What was the full name of the man who was arrested after the Yeomanry charged into a crowd, killing a child? is inside the article: The Peterloo Massacre took place at St Peter's Field, Manchester, England, on 16 August 1819, when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000–80,000 who had gathered to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated by the introduction of the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt. Shortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with him. The Yeomanry charged into the crowd, knocking down a woman and killing a child, and finally apprehending Hunt. The 15th Hussars were then summoned by the magistrate, Mr Hulton, to disperse the crowd. They charged with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 18 people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier. Historian Robert Poole has called the Peterloo Massacre one of the defining moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government to crack down on reform, with the passing of what became known as the Six Acts. It also led directly to the foundation of the Manchester Guardian, but had little other effect on the pace of reform. In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial.

Here are possible answers to this question: - wilderness - encyclopedia - magazine - commercial - countryside I believe the correct choice is \\"encyclopedia\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"You are correct in choosing \\"encyclopedia\\" as the best source to look up information about a sloth. Below, I will provide a detailed explanation as to why an encyclopedia is the most appropriate choice from the given options and why the other alternatives are not as suitable for this purpose. 1. Encyclopedia: Encyclopedias are comprehensive, organized collections of information on a broad range of subjects. They are designed to provide detailed, reliable, and up-to-date information that can help users gain a solid understanding of various topics. Since sloths are a specific animal species that fall under the category of biological science, utilizing an encyclopedia would be the most effective and accurate way to obtain information about them. Encyclopedias often include both general knowledge about sloths - such as their appearance, habitat, diet, and behavior - as well as more specialized information on their anatomy, biology, and conservation status. 2. Wilderness: This option refers to a natural environment that has not been significantly altered or influenced by human activity. While it is true that sloths can be found in their natural habitat - which may be classified as the wilderness - this is not a type of written material that can be consulted to learn about these animals. To study sloths in the wilderness, one would have to engage in field research activities such as observations and data collection, which is a completely different method that does not involve consulting written resources. 3. Magazine: Magazines are periodical publications that typically focus on a specific subject or theme. Some magazines may feature articles about sloths; however, these publications are unlikely to provide the depth of information required for a comprehensive understanding of this species. Moreover, content published in magazines is usually less authoritative and less subject to rigorous peer review than that found in encyclopedias, thus making the information found in magazines potentially less accurate. 4. Commercial: This term generally pertains to business and trade activities, including advertising and promotion of products or services. It is not related to written works or informational resources, and as such, would not be a relevant answer to the question in the context provided. 5. Countryside: The term \\"countryside\\" refers to the land and scenery of rural areas, which are typically characterized by farms, small towns, and natural landscapes. While it is possible that sloths might be mentioned or discussed in written materials about the countryside (particularly if it pertains to areas where they are native, such as Central and South America), the term itself does not directly refer to a collection of writings or a specific text where one would expect to find comprehensive information about these animals. In conclusion, given the available choices, an encyclopedia is the most appropriate and reliable resource if you want to look up detailed information about a sloth. Encyclopedias provide comprehensive, accurate, and well-organized information on a wide range of subjects, making them the ideal choice for gaining a thorough understanding of the topic at hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains - This inner core is known as a white dwarf. Question: suppose The inner gets divided into more pieces happens, how will it affect the size of the dwarf star is smaller. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If the inner core of a red giant, known as a white dwarf, were to be divided into smaller pieces, the effect on the size of the dwarf star would depend on the manner in which the division occurs. To address the question, let's consider the key factors and perturbations involved. First, it is essential to understand the nature of a white dwarf. A white dwarf is the remnant of a stellar core left behind after a star has exhausted its nuclear fuel and expelled its outer layers as a planetary nebula. These objects are characterized by their high density and degenerate electron gas providing the pressure to counteract gravitational collapse. White dwarfs are composed primarily of carbon and oxygen, with a thin outer layer of helium and/or hydrogen. With this in mind, we can analyze the supposed perturbation and its influence on the second effect mentioned - the size of the dwarf star. 1. If the inner core were to be divided into smaller pieces but remained gravitationally bound and retained their overall density, there would be no effect on the size of the dwarf star. Although the inner core would now consist of multiple smaller pieces, the combined mass and characteristics would remain unchanged. 2. If the division of the inner core led to the ejection or dispersal of some material, thereby reducing the overall mass, it would likely cause the white dwarf to become smaller in size. In this case, there would be a reduction in the gravitational force holding the core together, and the ensuing decrease in electron degeneracy pressure would lessen the effective outward pressure. Overall, this would contribute to a smaller white dwarf size. 3. On the other hand, if the division of the inner core were to trigger a physical or chemical change within the core leading to a reduced density or a change in electron degeneracy pressure, it could potentially result in either a larger or smaller white dwarf size. The specific outcome would depend on the nature of the change and the balance between gravitational and internal pressures. In summary, the effect of dividing the inner core of a white dwarf into smaller pieces on the size of the dwarf star would depend on the specific circumstances and the resulting changes in mass, density, and pressure within the core. The size of the dwarf star could be more, less, or remain unchanged depending on the details of the perturbation and the subsequent response of the core."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what destroyed the Palace of Westminster? Context: Remodelling of the structure began in 1762. After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834.

The red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. It also causes the red color of the planet Mars. The red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering, which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye. The color of autumn leaves is caused by pigments called anthocyanins, which are produced towards the end of summer, when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced. One to two percent of the human population has red hair; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin.\\"?

Firstly, the passage mentions that some people are currently finding themselves in relationship triangles, which suggests that these relationships involve at least three individuals interconnected in some way. These triangles may not necessarily be problematic; rather, they can sometimes produce good results and, as the example suggests, even positive outcomes. A notable example in the passage is \\"the soldier, his son, and I,\\" which indicates that a harmonious relationship can exist within this triad. Instead of causing issues or tensions, this particular triangle can function in a beneficial manner. Another unique aspect of these relationships is that the \\"other entity\\" mentioned within the context could be any person or even a non-human entity. The passage highlights that it does not have to be another woman, opening up a broader perspective on what these relationship triangles can entail. This aspect underscores the varied and complex nature of human interactions and relationships. In summary, the relationships described in the passage are unique due to 1) the presence of triangles, which involve at least three interconnected individuals, 2) the possibility of positive and harmonious outcomes within these triangles, and 3) the fact that the other entity involved in the triangles is not necessarily another woman, thus expanding the possibilities of who or what can be part of these unique relationship configurations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As she lay on the ground, reeling from the impact, she made the conscious decision to disengage and allow the situation to deescalate. In situations like these, it's important to prioritize personal safety and the well-being of everyone involved, which is why it's reasonable for Jessica to quit the fight after being knocked down. Thoughts of retaliation crossed Jessica's mind for a brief moment, but she knew it would not help mend their relationship or resolve the underlying issue.

Answer:","completion":"The best answer choice for the question \\"Behaviors that improve fitness improve through what\\" is evolution. This is because behaviors that improve fitness increase through the process of natural selection. Natural selection is the mechanism by which organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing on those traits to their offspring. Over time, these advantageous traits become more prevalent in the population, resulting in the species adapting to its environment and improving its overall fitness. This gradual process of change in species over time is known as evolution. While some of the other answer choices, such as riding a bike, sleep, and energy, can indeed contribute to one's personal fitness, they are not mechanisms through which behaviors that improve fitness propagate within a population or species. Similarly, factors like environment, reduced heat, competition, and summer could play a role in shaping an organism's fitness or the fitness of a specific behavior, but they are not the process through which those behaviors improve across generations. Therefore, the best answer choice for this question is evolution, as it describes the inherent mechanism by which organisms' behaviors that improve fitness increase over time in response to natural selection pressures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By 2050, the world's population could grow from 6.7 billion to more than 9 billion. All of those people will need water to drink. But the bad news is that some areas of the world are growing drier because of climate change. The total area of the Earth's surface classified as very dry has doubled since the 1970s. Sadly, the precious resource is still misused in industry, in farming and at homes. Therefore, the world is facing a crisis over water. \\"You do the math, and it gets a little scary,\\" says Stuart Minchin, a water expert in Australia. \\"We're waking up,\\" he says. \\"But not fast enough.\\" In southern Australia, farmers have been hit hard. They can't irrigate their fields well enough. The Australian government has launched a 1.3 billion project to improve Australia's irrigation system to stop the crop production dropping further. Australians have serious water worries, but it could be worse. They don't have to fear that when they turn on the tap, nothing will come out. That's the case in India. Many people in New Delhi, the capital, go without clean water for days. City leaders have taken stricter measures to save water. Users pay a very high but affordable price for it. Homeowners who waste water are given large fines. There are 1.9 million people who live in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now it has grown by more than 300,000 people since 2002.

His cellmate, Gerry, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. The two men get to know each other and we see them living within the cell. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina. Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Lohan is then seen smoking a cigarette, as in the opening scenes, his hand bloodied. Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards are seen snickering as they are handed to the prisoners who respond, after Sands' initial action, by tearing up the clothes and wrecking their cells. For the next interaction with the prisoners, a large number of riot police are seen coming into the prison on a truck.

Question What was it they figured out from watching the live feed footage ? Answer:","completion":"From the information provided, it seems that they figured out the identity of the person with long black and blue hair from watching the live feed footage. Although it's not explicitly mentioned what specific detail or action led to this realization, it can be inferred that something in the footage revealed the true identity of the individual, despite the initial confusion due to the presence of different hair colors. There could be several factors that contributed to this identification. It might be that the person in question displayed recognizable mannerisms or behaviors that were familiar to those watching the live feed. Additionally, the individual could have been wearing clothing or accessories that were unique to them or associated with their identity. Another possibility is that the camera captured a clear view of the person's face, allowing those analyzing the footage to make a positive identification despite the difference in hair color. Furthermore, the statement \\"You almost got away from us\\" suggests that the individual had attempted to evade or escape detection from others, perhaps as part of some sort of operation or event. The live feed footage ultimately foiled this attempt, and the group was able to identify the person with long black and blue hair, even though they initially failed to recognize them. They were then able to promptly inform others about the situation and the person's true identity, thwarting any plan to elude them. In any case, the live feed footage served as a crucial piece of evidence that allowed the group to figure out the true identity of the individual with long black and blue hair.

Q: Text: so i've been needing to confess this for awhile... years ago as a young plumber i got an afternoon emergency call to a pretty rough section of town for a flooded/stopped up sewer for an apartment building. i had never been to this building before, so i had to investigate the best way to clean the sewer when i arrived. when i began looking it appeared that every apartment had their own 'end of the line' clean out in the alley behind the units, so i stretched an extension cord, grabbed my sewer machine and started hustling. i began feeding the cable and soon i was hitting a few spots that felt rough and were giving me issues, but after passing those, i got to a spot that my cable was simply not passing. it was giving me pure hell. i fought it and fought it (my younger self didn't realize that this was unnatural and i needed to stop and reevaluate) until finally, success!!! i busted through the spot... but the water was not going down (bad sign) so i ran some more cable through and when i still didn't have any luck, i began pulling the cable back. now the real fight began!!! i started pulling... and tugging... and cussing... then i took a break for a few seconds before continuing... then i picked it back up and started pulling it back inch by inch. (there are machines with power feeds that help with the pushing and pulling, my boss doesn't care for those) when i finally pulled the cable out of the sewer, i could see that it had something wrapped all around it. i began unraveling it off of the end of my cable and realized it was a pink shower curtain. i had recently been doing work in the local holding facility for our city and had heard all sorts of horror stories about what the inmates had been flushing down the toilets, so my gut reaction was, 'what the hell kind of animal flushes a shower curtain down his own damn toilet???' well it was about 90 degrees out, over a hundred with the humidity/heat index, so after this fight, i wasn't totally putting together the clues... until: \\"oh my gosh, mister, are you the plumber??? something happened in my bathroom, my toilet exploded!!!! please, you've gotta help me, my bathroom is flooding out!!!\\" it was in that moment that perfect clarity hit me like a ton of bricks and i had an incredible sinking feeling. i ran around to find his toilet obliterated, his bowl and his toilet tank shattered, the water flooding out of the tank, his bathroom floor flooding into his hallway, aaaaand his shower curtain ripped off of the rod. the 'end of the line' cleanout in the flooded alleyway was actually a 2-way cleanout that i was unable to see due to the flood and the sewer was actually going out the rear to the street behind. so i shut off the water, sucked up the flood with a shop-vac, replaced his toilet that evening, cleaned the sewer the correct way this time and still 10 years later still get reminded by my boss about that day from time to time. oh, the gentleman wanted his shower curtain back, i pointed out that i had swabbed the sewer with it. he said he would hose it down. i pointed out that it now had holes in it from the blade on the sewer machine and then he decided he could get a new one.... additionally, he also called our shop the next day and said his wife's 3 carat diamond ring must have fallen off the toilet tank when my machine busted into the room. we informed his landlord that we didn't see a ring while inside cleaning and that judging from the contents of his apartment, we doubted that a ring had been there. the landlord hung up with us and 5 minutes later the tenant called us back and said he found the ring. i'm not sure if the landlord threatened him with eviction or what, but we didn't ask.

Q:Process: - Kidneys filter waste out of blood - Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells - Calcium levels are maintained. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose volume of water in blood is kept more constant happens, how will it affect kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells less. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this situation explores the possible effects of maintaining the volume of water in the blood at a more constant level and its impact on the kidney's ability to stimulate the production of red blood cells. The relationship between these two functions is complex and interconnected, involving various factors, feedback mechanisms, and hormones within the body. To understand the potential effects of this perturbation on the process, let's examine the individual roles and factors involved in these functions. The kidneys play a vital role in filtering the blood, balancing fluid and electrolyte levels, regulating blood pressure, and overall, maintaining a stable internal environment. One primary regulatory mechanism is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is crucial for controlling blood pressure and fluid balance. When the kidneys detect low blood pressure or decreased blood flow, they release the enzyme renin, which activates the RAAS, leading to the production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, narrows blood vessels and increases blood pressure, while aldosterone aids in the retention of sodium and water to expand blood volume and enhance the blood pressure. As for the production of red blood cells, the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) in response to low oxygen levels in the blood. Red blood cells (erythrocytes) contain hemoglobin, a protein responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and organs while also carrying carbon dioxide back to the lungs for exhalation. As the kidneys monitor blood oxygen levels, they adjust EPO release accordingly to stimulate red blood cell production in the bone marrow and ensure adequate oxygen supply. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the volume of water in the blood is kept more constant, it could potentially impact the kidney's ability to stimulate red blood cell production. On one hand, consistently maintaining the volume of water in the blood may have indirect effects on EPO production. Since the blood volume influences blood pressure, constantly regulating blood water content may lead to relatively stable blood pressure levels, ensuring that the renal arterial blood flow remains constant. The kidneys may then not need to release EPO as frequently to maintain oxygen delivery to the tissues, leading to a reduced stimulus for red blood cell production. However, it is essential to note that other factors also influence EPO production and red blood cell generation. These include anemia, blood loss, pregnancy, high altitude, and certain pathological conditions. Hence, although the perturbation hypothesis proposed might have an indirect impact on red blood cell production, it is unlikely that it alone would result in significant alterations. Several other factors can counteract or contribute to the overall regulation of red blood cell formation. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have a potential indirect effect on the process of red blood cell production stimulated by the kidneys. However, this effect appears to be relatively minor, considering the contributions of numerous factors and feedback mechanisms involved in the process. Therefore, while the hypothesis suggests an interesting influence of blood water content on red blood cell production, it is crucial to acknowledge the complex and multifactorial nature of these physiological processes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What two people were killed inside the store? Is \\"During the incident, Culver City gang members David \\"Puppet\\" Robles and Jesse \\"Psycho\\" Garcia entered the store masked and began opening fire, killing Anthony and Michael Juarez.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, your statement accurately answers the question. During the incident, David \\"Puppet\\" Robles and Jesse \\"Psycho\\" Garcia, who were members of the Culver City gang, entered the store wearing masks and opened fire. The two victims, Anthony Juarez and Michael Juarez, were killed inside the store as a result of the gunfire. This specific event highlights the devastating impact of gang violence on local communities and the innocent lives that can be tragically disrupted as a result. The actions taken by David Robles and Jesse Garcia represent the dangerous and hostile nature of gang activities and serve as a reminder of the importance of addressing and combating gang-related crime. Efforts to prevent and mitigate gang violence typically involve a combination of targeted law enforcement actions, community-based prevention initiatives, and improved access to social services and opportunities for at-risk individuals. Research has demonstrated that comprehensive, multi-faceted approaches to addressing gang violence can be more effective than solely relying on traditional law enforcement tactics. By understanding the complex social, economic, and psychological factors that contribute to the development and persistence of gangs, communities can develop more effective strategies to prevent gang violence and promote public safety. In conclusion, the incident in which David \\"Puppet\\" Robles and Jesse \\"Psycho\\" Garcia killed Anthony Juarez and Michael Juarez inside the store provides a tragic example of the consequences of gang violence and underscores the importance of implementing multi-faceted strategies to address this critical issue. As communities and law enforcement agencies work together to combat gang-related crime, it is essential to consider the diverse range of factors that contribute to the problem and to develop holistic solutions that promote long-term change."},{"prompt":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

Syntactically, this sentence follows the Subject-Verb-Indirect Object-Direct Object (S-V-IO-DO) structure, which is common in English sentences. In this case: - Subject (S): Smith - Verb (V): threw - Indirect Object (IO): the first baseman - Direct Object (DO): the ball This structure demonstrates a proper syntax as English sentences can be formed with S-V-IO-DO order when the verb transfers its action through an indirect object to a direct object. Semantically, the sentence is also acceptable: - The subject, \\"Smith,\\" is the one performing the action of throwing. - The verb, \\"threw,\\" indicates the action being taken. - The indirect object, \\"the first baseman,\\" is the receiver of the direct object. - The direct object, \\"the ball,\\" is the item being thrown by Smith and caught by the first baseman.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the place with the iron overshot wheel? The newest bridge across the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a pedestrian footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill has been the subject of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper's cottage still exist. Further south the river flows under the A303 near Norton-sub-Hamdon and the A356 near Chedington.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name that Watts objected to? ? Although Watts's plans for the memorial had envisaged names inscribed on the wall, in the event the memorial was designed to hold panels of hand-painted and glazed ceramic tiles. Watts was an acquaintance of William De Morgan, at that time one of the world's leading tile designers, and consequently found them easier and cheaper to obtain than engraved stone. The four initial memorial tablets, installed for the unveiling, each consisted of two large custom-made tiles, with each tablet costing £3 5s (about £360 as of 2019) to produce. Only four tablets were installed by the time of the unveiling ceremony, and Watts already had concerns about the potential costs of installing the 120 tablets envisaged in the memorial's design.Costs were allayed by using standard 6-inch (15 cm) tiles for the next set of tablets, reducing the costs to a more manageable £2 per tablet. In 1902, nine further tablets were installed, intermittently spaced along the central of the five rows, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had lobbied. The subjects of the 13 initial tiles had been personally selected by Watts, who had for many years maintained a list of newspaper reports of heroic actions potentially worthy of recognition. However, by this time he was in his eighties and in increasingly poor health, and in January 1904 the vicar and churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate formed the Humble Heroes Memorial Committee to oversee the completion of the project, agreeing to defer to Watts regarding additions to the memorial. Watts strenuously objected to the name, as \\"not being applicable to anything as splendid as heroic self-sacrifice\\", and the committee was renamed the \\"Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee\\".On 1 July 1904 George Frederic Watts died at New Little Holland House, aged 87. He was hailed \\"The last great Victorian\\", and a memorial service was held in St Paul's Cathedral, 300 yards (270 m) south of Postman's Park, on 7 July 1904.On 11 July 1904 Mary Watts wrote to the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial...

Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction.

The Home Affairs Select Committee said responsibility for counter-terrorism should move from the Met Police to the six-month-old National Crime Agency. It said intelligence agencies required better oversight and accountability. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said MPs had misunderstood the Met's role. The UK's Counter-Terrorism Command currently sits within the Metropolitan Police, with the force working with both the security and intelligence agencies as well as regional police units. The government has already considered and dropped a proposal to move counter-terrorism to the National Crime Agency (NCA) - although it has not ruled out making the switch once the new agency is bedded in. In the report, MPs said the Met had argued there needed to be a link between neighbourhood and counter-terrorism policing because of the role police officers had in both detecting plots and seeking to win the trust of communities. However, MPs said it was now time for a major change, adding that the current system belonged in the \\"pre-internet age\\". \\"The current difficulties faced by the [Metropolitan Police] lead us to believe that the responsibility for counter-terrorism ought to be moved to the NCA in order to allow the Met to focus on the basics of policing London,\\" said the MPs. \\"The work to transfer the command ought to begin immediately with a view to a full transfer of responsibility for counter-terrorism operations taking place, for example within five years after the NCA became operational, in 2018. \\"When this takes place, it should finally complete the jigsaw of the new landscape of policing.\\" The report comes in the wake of the Edward Snowden leaks about mass surveillance capabilities which, in turn, prompted a debate among MPs over who is best placed to scrutinise the UK's agencies. The committee had asked for MI5's director general Andrew Parker to give evidence, but Home Secretary Theresa May blocked the request. The MPs attacked the \\"weak nature\\" of oversight of the intelligence and security agencies and said it was \\"hyperbole\\" to suggest that public engagement risked national security. Members of the Intelligence and Security Committee - which is appointed to oversee the work of the intelligence agencies in the UK - should be elected, said the MPs. They also said in future the chair should always be a member of the opposition party in the House of Commons and should be subject to a vote. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: \\"The current system of oversight is designed to scrutinise the work of George Smiley not the 21st Century reality of the security and intelligence services. \\"The agencies are at the cutting edge of sophistication and are owed an equally refined system of democratic scrutiny.\\" \\"It is an embarrassing indictment of our system that some in the media felt compelled to publish leaked information to ensure that matters were heard in Parliament. \\"The Intelligence and Security Committee should be given a democratic mandate in the same way as other select committees. We will then be able to robustly defend our methods of scrutiny and better serve those who protect us, and the public.\\" However, in a statement, Acpo said it was \\"concerned\\" at the prospect of the move, which was \\"a decision that does not appear to supported by the evidence and is based on an apparent misunderstanding of the role played by the Metropolitan Police Service\\". \\"Counter-terrorism policing is not directed through a single lead force but rather has responsibility vested in nine chief constables across the UK in areas where the threat is considered to be the greatest. \\"These chief constables act collaboratively and effectively on behalf of all forces, while at the same time maintaining close and critical links into local policing.\\" It said the current system was \\"admired and respected by other countries\\".

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. It was a dream, then a place, then a memory. My father built it near the Suwannee River. I like to think it was in the heart of Florida, because it was, and is, in my heart. Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes. And then Grandma Bette wouldn't say a word for half an hour or more, a very long time for Grandma Bette to be quiet. Her father built the place: - not enough information - When they were living in Holland - After the Nixes moved to North America - While they were indentured servants Answer:","completion":"Dogland, the place situated near the Suwannee River in the heart of Florida, holds a special place in my heart as it evokes cherished memories of my father and the stories he used to tell. The name itself remains etched in the core of my being, as it represents not only the physical location my father built but also the emotional connection our family shared with it. To comprehend the significance and the true essence of Dogland, it is essential to delve into the personal history of the Nix family. The understanding of our past and the events leading up to the establishment of Dogland begins with the stories my father shared, although admittedly, their veracity was often questioned by my grandmother, Grandma Bette. Nonetheless, these seemingly embellished accounts remain the only source of information about our family's history, and as such, they are integral to our collective identity. According to my father's stories, our ancestors arrived in North America as indentured servants, working tirelessly to clear themselves of debts incurred in debtor's prisons. This claim, as my grandmother would point out, lacked concrete evidence; however, our family's resilience and determination to overcome obstacles resonated throughout the generations. My father also mentioned our mixed ancestry, with both Lakota and Ojibwe blood coursing through our veins - another statement challenged by Grandma Bette. Whether our roots trace back to indigenous tribes or to the Black Dutch, the fact remains that the Nixes carried an unmistakable air of mystery and pride about them. The idea of Dogland began as a dream, conceived by my father when he was a mere indentured servant seeking solace amidst the constant toil required of him. As the years passed, the concept took shape – first in his mind, then on paper, and finally as an actual physical space. Nestled within the lush greenery adjacent to the Suwannee River, Dogland stood as a testament to my father's vision and unyielding determination. Dogland soon became a memory etched in the hearts of everyone who stepped foot in it. A microcosm of our family's history, it was a space where stories were passed down, truths were revealed, and connections were forged. Our home, both literally and metaphorically, it was where we solidified our roots and built our identity. However, I must admit that my recollection of those days is akin to that of a spectral figure, with poor vision and a fragmented memory. The river that maps our history is often obscured by the fog of time or the glare of future uncertainties. There are moments when all that remains are shadows and vague impressions, as I struggle to grasp the details of our shared past and the characters that shaped it. In conclusion, the story of Dogland serves as a reminder of the importance of our family's history and the sacrifices that led to the creation of this cherished place. It is a blend of truths and fictions, as any story would be, relayed by my father through his tales. Simultaneously, it compels us to ponder where fact ends and fabrication begins, demonstrating the power of stories in shaping our identities and our understanding of the past. Ultimately, all we can do is embrace the fragments of history that make up the tapestry of our lives, as it is through these anecdotes that the essence of our family – and Dogland – endures forever."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \\"Cougars\\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code violations. Beginning in the 2011 season, BYU football competes in college football as an independent. In addition, most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference. Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. For outdoor track and field, the Cougars became an Independent. Softball returned to the Western Athletic Conference, but spent only one season in the WAC; the team moved to the Pacific Coast Softball Conference after the 2012 season. The softball program may move again after the 2013 season; the July 2013 return of Pacific to the WCC will enable that conference to add softball as an official sport. When does BYU refuse to play athletic games that got the attention of the sports networks?","completion":"BYU refuses to play athletic games on Sundays, which has received attention from sports networks.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

What were the causes for demonetization in India? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"1. Define species: Step 1: In order to define \\"species,\\" I will look for a reputable source like a dictionary or a scientific article that provides a clear definition. Step 2: Upon researching, I found the following definition: \\"A species is a group of living organisms consisting of similar individuals capable of exchanging genes or interbreeding. The species is the principal natural taxonomic unit, ranking below a genus and denoted by a Latin binomial, e.g., Homo sapiens.\\" (Source: Oxford Languages) Step 3: Evaluate the definition to ensure its accuracy from a reputable source, which it is, as it comes from Oxford Languages. Final outcome: The definition of species is a group of living organisms consisting of similar individuals capable of exchanging genes or interbreeding, and they are the principal natural taxonomic unit, ranking below a genus and denoted by a Latin binomial. 2. Causes for demonetization in India: Step 1: Research the topic to determine the reasons behind demonetization in India. Step 2: Gather information from reputable sources to find evidence on the causes of demonetization. Step 3: Analyze the information and summarize the findings. The main causes for demonetization in India, which took place on November 8, 2016, were: a. To combat corruption and black money b. To curb counterfeit currency circulation c. To promote a cashless economy and transition to digital transactions d. To reduce terrorist funding and illegal activities funded by cash 3. Check if the two questions have the same meaning: The two questions ask about different topics. The first question asks for the definition of species, while the second question asks about the causes for demonetization in India.

An admiral in command.","completion":"Yes, in both sentences, the word \\"command\\" fundamentally conveys the same meaning. However, the nuances can slightly differ depending on the context of the sentence, the structure, or the military role mentioned. In the military context, the term \\"command\\" implies authority, leadership, or control over a group of people, usually soldiers, a division, a unit, or an operation. It involves making decisions, crafting strategies, and ensuring that people under the person's authority follow the directives and operate efficiently. In both sentences: 1) \\"General Smith was placed in command,\\" and 2) \\"An admiral in command,\\" \\"Command\\" refers to the administrative power, leadership, and control bestowed upon an individual – here, General Smith, and an unnamed Admiral, respectively. The individual in command often has the final say on decisions related to military or naval operations. In the first sentence, there is an additional context - General Smith was assigned or given the leadership role. It does not provide specifics about what he was commanding, whether it was a specific military operation, an army regiment, or any other unit of the military. The focus is not just on the fact that he has authority, but also that someone (likely a higher authority) placed him into that position. In the second sentence, the fact that an admiral is in command is more a statement of the individual's role or status. An \\"admiral in command\\" implies the individual is actively exercising authority within the naval forces but doesn't necessarily imply a recent change in the state of affairs. The sentence doesn't indicate who placed the admiral in this position, only that they are currently in a commanding role. Other details, like what, precisely, the admiral is commanding, aren't given here — we just know they have authority. In summation, while the basic meaning of \\"command\\" remains similar in both sentences relating to a person's leadership, authority, and control, the emphasis in each sentence is slightly different due to the overall structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: \\"Teenager\\" is the new term being used in the UK to describe kids at either 8--12 or 10--13 years old. More and more companies are beginning to create products and services for teenagers. The Disney Company sells music and film to teenagers and their parents. You can get everything from lunchboxes and mobile phone covers, to monthly fan magazines and clothing. It's all about sales, which suggests that teenagers must have more money, freedom and influence upon their parents than they've ever had before. Most kids in the UK today get more pocket money than kids did ten years ago. Parents have more money to give their kids than before, since parents are having fewer children. In addition, the divorce rate in the UK is continually rising and parents spend less time with their children than they used to, so many parents try to please their children by buying them presents. It's a bad habit for both parents and kids to get into, but parents are under pressure from commercial marketing and the pleas of their children. UK kids today are very media and computer-literate. A lot of kids have a TV, if not a computer, in their bedrooms. They have easy access to much more information about life and the world. They may have experienced a lot in life as well, since 24% of UK kids live in single-parent families, so people now say that \\"kids are getting older younger\\". With such maturity at such a young age, it's no wonder teenagers are able to influence their parents and have more freedom than previous generations. UK teenagers never used to be worried about spending money on clothes. That's changed. Now, they are much more fashion conscious and concerned about their image . Many of them outgrow the bright colors and fashions of kids years ago and go for something darker and more rebellious . Surely none of the above is a good thing. The UK government is certainly concerned, and for that reason has strict laws preventing companies from marketing their products and services at children. Question: Why are more products and services created for teenagers? Options: A: Because companies are creating better products and services. B: Because children education is becoming more important. C: Because it is better to study music from an early age. D: .Because children have more money to buy them. Answer:","completion":"D: Because children have more money to buy them. The article indicates that more products and services are being created for the \\"teenager\\" demographic, kids ranging from 8-13 years old in the UK, because these children have more disposable income than previous generations. They have this money due to their parents giving them more pocket money, as parents now generally have fewer children and thus more money to share with the kids they do have. It's also suggested that parents are trying to compensate for spending less time with their kids, which is a result of the rising divorce rate, by buying them gifts more frequently. Furthermore, these kids have considerable influence over their parents' spending, which is also funneling more money toward purchases for this age group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Santamental, released in October 2003, is a collaborative project featuring several prominent musicians such as guitarists Eddie Van Halen, Slash, Steve Vai, and drummer Gregg Bissonette. When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he responded with a quip about his suitability for the project. The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures. He said of the album, \\"But I never dreamt in a million years that I'd do a Christmas record.\\"The musicians Lukather chose for Santamental, most of whom were involved in the hard-rock genre, lent a heavy feel to the album. Van Halen recorded guitar tracks for \\"Joy to the World\\" after not having been in the studio for some time but immediately made an impression on Lukather with his level of playing. Vai provided guitar work for \\"Carol of the Bells\\" along with Lukather's son Trevor, then 14 years old. Slash, who recorded his part in one take, played on the Lukather/Stan Lynch composition \\"Broken Heart for Christmas\\".

Burges died, aged 53, in his Red Bed at the Tower House, at 11.45 p.m. on Wednesday 20 April 1881. While on a tour of works at Cardiff, he caught a chill and returned to London, half-paralysed, where he lay dying for some three weeks. Among his last visitors were Oscar Wilde and James Whistler. He was buried in the tomb he designed for his mother at West Norwood, London. On his death, John Starling Chapple, Burges's office manager and close associate for more than twenty years, wrote \\"a constant relationship ... with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe. Thank God his work will live and ... be the admiration of future students. I have hardly got to realize my lonely position yet. He was almost all the world to me.\\" Lady Bute, wife of his greatest patron, wrote, \\"Dear Burges, ugly Burges, who designed such lovely things – what a duck.\\" In Saint Fin Barre's, together with memorials to his mother and sister, there is a memorial plaque to Burges, designed by him, and erected by his father. It shows the King of Heaven presiding over the four apostles, who hold open the Word of God. Under the inscription \\"Architect of this cathedral\\" is a simple shield and a small, worn, plaque with a mosaic surround, bearing Burges's entwined initials and name. Legal complications obstructed Burges's wish to be buried in the cathedral he had built. Burges's own words on Saint Fin Barre's, in his letter of January 1877 to the Bishop of Cork, sum up his career, \\"Fifty years hence, the whole affair will be on its trial and, the elements of time and cost being forgotten, the result only will be looked at.

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.

The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - A correctional facility, detention center, gaol (Australia, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, UK), jail (US, Canada), penitentiary, prison, or remand centre is a facility in which inmates are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state as a form of punishment after being convicted of crimes.

Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

The channel was originally launched as a constant commercial-free music video channel, much like the original MTV channel; but once MTV started to change its focus from music to reality television in the 2000s, MTV2's focus changed as well, thus bringing music video programming away from both MTV and MTV2. Today, MTV2 broadcasts unscripted programming and syndicated television episodes from MTV and other networks. - Adult Swim is a programming block of the American cable network Cartoon Network that operates at night from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., Eastern and Pacific Time.

Does it follow that \\"The basic humanity of a person does not depend on how they came into this world, for example.\\"? Select from: * yes; * it is not possible to tell; * no;","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"The basic humanity of a person does not depend on how they came into this world, for example.\\" is in alignment with the provided claim. Both statements emphasize that an individual's inherent worth as a human being is not determined by the circumstances of their birth or the presence of shared DNA. Rather, the recognition of one's basic humanity depends on other factors, such as their character, behavior, and values. Humanity, defined as the quality of being humane or compassionate, is a complex attribute that encompasses various aspects of human life. These aspects include understanding, empathy, moral responsibility, and the capacity to form social relationships. As such, it is important to acknowledge that each person's humanity is unique and transcends their circumstances of birth or genetic connections. Moreover, emphasizing the importance of character over biological factors encourages a more inclusive and egalitarian society. This perspective ensures that all individuals, regardless of their origins, are recognized as valuable and deserving of human rights and respect. In conclusion, the statement \\"The basic humanity of a person does not depend on how they came into this world, for example.\\" reiterates the belief that one's dignity and worth as a human being are not determined by issues such as their birth or genetic similarities. Instead, one's character, actions, and values are more significant factors in establishing an individual's humanity. Encouraging this viewpoint promotes a more just and inclusive social environment, in which every person is recognized and respected for who they are, and not for how they came into being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: If you don't mind the flare style, look for jeans with a flare around the leg rather than straight-leg varieties. This draws attention to your bottom half, making your legs look longer. Make sure that the flare jeans do not drag on the floor as this can make you look shorter rather than taller. If you like to wear dresses, consider dresses that cinch at the waist just above the hips. This makes your body look well-proportioned, lengthening your frame overall. Avoid dresses that are long and loose as this can make you look like you're drowning in them, drawing attention to your height. For example, go for a dress with a pencil line skirt that cinches at the waist. Take a pass on the baggy maxi dress. A higher waist helps make your legs look longer, stretching out your figure overall. When selecting pants or skirts, look for ones that are meant to be buttoned and zipped at the waist. Bottoms that fall at the hips are much less likely to lengthen your frame. If you are having trouble finding high-waisted garments, look for vintage styles. Many of them tend to have higher waists. If you find your pants sag near the crotch, either have them tailored or find another pair. Saggy pants in general are unfashionable and can be especially un-flattering if you're on the shorter side. If your pants look like they're sagging, this will make you look shorter overall. If you can't get new pants, pull them up so that they don't sag, and wear a belt to keep them up. This is a must if you're trying to look tall, as saggy legs draw attention to your shorter frame. If you really struggle to find a pair, you can always have a pair tailored or cuff the legs yourself.

Answer:","completion":"To determine how Lee would feel after the hug from Aubrey, let's break down the situation step by step: 1. Analyze the situation: Lee had just lost the game and was likely feeling disappointed or upset about their performance. Aubrey came to Lee to provide support and comfort in this difficult moment. 2. Consider Aubrey's action: Aubrey hugged Lee, which is a physical gesture of support and empathy. This can convey a sense of understanding and solace, helping Lee to feel less alone in their disappointment. 3. Understand the impact of Aubrey's action on Lee's emotions: The hug from Aubrey might have made Lee feel comforted and cared for, helping to alleviate some of their emotional distress. It could also help them start processing their feelings in a more positive way, knowing that they have support from their friends or family. 4.

Three weeks after the mission, U.S. President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) attends a diplomatic dinner in Moscow, during which he praises the capture and insists the United States will no longer negotiate with terrorists. Marshall and his entourage, including his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews), and several of his Cabinet and advisers, prepare to return to the United States on Air Force One. In addition, a number of members of the press corps have been invited aboard, including Russian terrorists and Radek loyalists disguised as journalists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman). After takeoff, Secret Service agent Gibbs (Xander Berkeley), who has been a mole, enables Korshunov and his men to obtain weapons and storm the plane, killing many of the other agents and military personnel before taking the civilians hostage. Marshall is raced to an escape pod in the cargo hold while pursued by Korshunov's men but they are too late to capture him as the pod is ejected. Instead, Korshunov storms the cockpit and prevents the plane from making an emergency landing at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany, and secures Grace and Alice separately from the other hostages. Several F-15s escort Air Force One as Korshunov has it piloted towards Radek-loyal airspace. Unknown to Korshunov, Marshall, a Vietnam War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, has remained hidden in the cargo hold instead of using the pod and begins to observe the loyalists using his military training. Marshall manages to kill some of Korshunov's men and then uses a satellite phone to make contact with his Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close), letting his staff know he is alive.

The act begins quietly, with Scarpia musing on the forthcoming downfall of Angelotti and Cavaradossi, while in the background a gavotte is played in a distant quarter of the Farnese Palace. For this music Puccini adapted a fifteen-year-old student exercise by his late brother, Michele, stating that in this way his brother could live again through him. In the dialogue with Spoletta, the \\"torture\\" motif—an \\"ideogram of suffering\\", according to Budden—is heard for the first time as a foretaste of what is to come. As Cavaradossi is brought in for interrogation, Tosca's voice is heard with the offstage chorus singing a cantata, \\"[its] suave strains contrast[ing] dramatically with the increasing tension and ever-darkening colour of the stage action\\". The cantata is most likely the Cantata a Giove, in the literature referred to as a lost work of Puccini's from 1897.Osborne describes the scenes that follow—Cavaradossi's interrogation, his torture, Scarpia's sadistic tormenting of Tosca—as Puccini's musical equivalent of grand guignol to which Cavaradossi's brief \\"Vittoria! Vittoria!\\" on the news of Napoleon's victory gives only partial relief. Scarpia's aria \\"Già, mi dicon venal\\" (\\"Yes, they say I am venal\\") is closely followed by Tosca's \\"Vissi d'arte\\". A lyrical andante based on Tosca's act 1 motif, this is perhaps the opera's best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake; he considered eliminating it since it held up the action. Fisher calls it \\"a Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing a woman who has lived unselfishly and righteously\\". In the act's finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil which follows Tosca's stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. After Tosca's contemptuous \\"E avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!\\" (\\"All Rome trembled before him\\"), sung on a middle C♯ monotone (sometimes spoken), the music gradually...

Q: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb.

When they play for a long time they have to stop because they do what? Options: - feeling happy - get hungry - learning - grow up - injury Explain why a human would choose \\"get hungry\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"get hungry\\" to answer the question above because it best represents the natural response and outcome when two individuals, in this case, Jimmy and Tim, engage in a prolonged activity such as playing together. Among the provided options: 1. Feeling happy - Although playing together can cause happiness, it would not be the reason for them to stop playing after a long time. 2. Get hungry - As humans engage in physical activities, they expend energy, and this energy depletion causes them to feel hungry over time. Hunger is a signal that the body needs to refuel, so they would eventually need to stop playing and eat something. 3. Learning - This option is rather vague and doesn't pertain directly to why they would need to stop playing after a long time. 4. Grow up - Growing up is a gradual process and wouldn't be an immediate reason why they would need to stop playing. 5. Injury - While injuries can occur during play, it is not an inherent outcome just because they have played for a long time. Given the context and the listed options, \\"get hungry\\" is the most reasonable answer because hunger is a natural bodily response to participating in sustained physical activities, such as playing, which deplete the body's energy resources. Therefore, a human would choose \\"get hungry\\" as the answer because it is the most logical option to explain why Jimmy and Tim have to stop playing after doing so for a long time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Who has a higher risk of hypertension? Jerry and George are two roommates who have lived together since college. They have always gotten along well, have similar hobbies and even are the same height. They both enjoy watching sports and playing videogames, but Jerry also rides his bike several miles each week. George can't stand exercising. Instead, he prefers to lay around relaxing and driving his car if he needs to go somewhere. Hint: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, George has a higher risk of hypertension compared to Jerry. The paragraph highlights that obesity, which occurs when the body mass index (BMI) reaches 30.0 kg/m² or greater, increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. While both Jerry and George have similarities such as their height and shared hobbies, their approach to physical activity and exercise is quite different. Jerry is more active, as he rides his bike several miles each week. This regular physical activity helps Jerry expend energy and reduce the likelihood that the unused energy from food will be stored as fat in his body. On the other hand, George prefers to avoid exercise and spends most of his time relaxing or driving his car. This sedentary behavior increases the chances that George will consume more energy from food than he needs, leading to the storage of excess energy as body fat. Over time, this could result in George becoming obese and consequently at a higher risk of developing hypertension. In conclusion, George, who is less active and more prone to obesity due to his sedentary lifestyle, has a higher risk of hypertension compared to Jerry, who engages in regular physical activity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What does Von Waldheim learn after flagging down the Army convoy? Title: The Train Movie plot: In 1944, masterpieces of modern art stolen by the Wehrmacht are being shipped to Germany; the officer in charge of the operation, Colonel Franz von Waldheim (Paul Scofield), is determined to take the paintings to Germany, no matter the cost. After the works chosen by Waldheim are removed from the Jeu de Paume Museum, curator Mademoiselle Villard (Suzanne Flon) seeks help from the French Resistance. Given the imminent liberation of Paris by the Allies, they need only delay the train for a few days, but it is a dangerous operation and must be done in a way that does not risk damaging the priceless cargo. Although Resistance cell leader and SNCF area inspector Paul Labiche (Burt Lancaster) initially rejects the plan, telling Mlle. Villard and senior Resistance leader Spinet (Paul Bonifas), \\"I won't waste lives on paintings,\\" he has a change of heart after a cantankerous elderly engineer, Papa Boule (Michel Simon), is executed for trying to sabotage the train on his own. After that sacrifice, Labiche joins his Resistance teammates Didont (Albert RÃ©my) and Pesquet (Charles Millot), who have been organizing their own plan to stop the train with the help of other SNCF Resistance members. They devise an elaborate ruse to reroute the train, temporarily changing railway station signage to make it appear to the German escort as if they are heading to Germany when they have actually turned back toward Paris. They then arrange a double collision in the small town of Rive-Reine that will block the train without risking the cargo. Labiche, although shot in the leg, escapes on foot with the help of the widowed owner of a Rive-Reine hotel, Christine (Jeanne Moreau), while other Resistance members involved in the plot are executed. The night after the collision, Labiche and Didont meet Spinet again, along with young Robert (the nephew of Jacques, the executed Rive-Reine station master) and plan to paint the tops of three boxcars white to warn off Allied aircraft from bombing the art train.

(CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health.

Question: what effect does anp have on blood pressure?? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question about the effect of ANP (Atrial Natriuretic Peptide) on blood pressure, let's first understand what ANP is and its role in the cardiovascular system. Then, we can discuss its impact on blood pressure. Step 1: Define ANP and its function Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) is a hormone released by the atria of the heart, primarily in response to the stretching of the atrial walls due to increased blood volume. Its main function is to help maintain fluid balance, blood volume, and blood pressure within the body. Step 2: Explain how ANP is involved in the regulation of blood pressure ANP impacts blood pressure by performing several actions, such as: 1. Triggering vasodilation: ANP promotes the relaxation of smooth muscle cells within blood vessel walls, resulting in their widening, a process known as vasodilation. This decreases peripheral vascular resistance, allowing blood to flow more easily and reducing blood pressure. 2. Promoting diuresis and natriuresis: ANP facilitates the excretion of salt (sodium) and water by the kidneys (called natriuresis). Simultaneously, it enhances diuresis, or the production of urine. These actions help to decrease blood volume, leading to a reduction in blood pressure. 3. Inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): ANP inhibits the release of renin, a key enzyme in the RAAS. Consequently, it suppresses the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, and aldosterone, a hormone that promotes sodium and water retention in the kidneys. By doing so, ANP counteracts the effects of RAAS, leading to decreased blood pressure. Step 3: Provide an answer In summary, Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) helps to lower blood pressure through its actions on vasodilation, promoting diuresis and natriuresis, and inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These actions work together to maintain fluid balance, blood volume, and blood pressure within the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Process: - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots - It passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves. Question: suppose less water is absorbed by the roots happens, how will it affect more water passes through vessels. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"less effect Explanation: Step-by-step justification: 1. The hypothesis states that less water is absorbed by the roots, meaning there is a reduction in the amount of water being taken up by the plant. 2. Water passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves, and this process is essential for efficient absorption of carbon dioxide and sunlight by the plant. 3. If less water is absorbed by the roots, it means there will be less water available to pass through the vessels in the stem, ultimately impacting the amount of water that reaches the leaves. 4. Since less water would be available to pass through the vessels in the stem, the overall water transportation system of the plant would be affected negatively. 5. The supposed perturbation (less water absorption) would result in less water passing through the vessels as well, as the two processes are directly linked.

Answer:","completion":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product due to several reasons mentioned by the reviewer. However, it is important to consider various factors when reading a negative review to understand if it would impact your personal experience with the product. Firstly, the reviewer mentioned that they did not experience the leaking problems that some other users had reported. This could indicate that the leakage issue might vary among users and may not be a universal problem with the product. Secondly, the reviewer found the bottles to be too fat, making them less comfortable to feed with and harder for the baby to hold. This is a matter of personal preference. If you share the same preference for slimmer bottles, then this review could impact your decision negatively. If you don't have a specific preference, this aspect might not be as significant for you. Thirdly, the reviewer pointed out that the thicker bottles were not compatible with their existing bottle warmer, which they had used for their first baby. This is an important aspect to consider, especially if you have other baby products or accessories you plan to use in conjunction with the bottles. If compatibility is a concern for you, then this review could strongly influence your decision to look for alternative bottle options.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was on the Mexican supply train Bowie attacked on November 26? from the following article ? By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About 160 miles (260 km) north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner. Urrea's troops then turned southwest by some 26 miles (42 km) to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 attacked a group of the expedition...

Answer the question: If Jim makes his resistor shorter, the resistance is exhibits is smaller or greater? A:","completion":"If Jim makes his resistor shorter, the resistance it exhibits will be smaller. This conclusion is based on the relationship between the length of a resistor and its resistance. Resistance is the measure of how much a resistor resists or opposes the flow of electric current through it. The resistance of a resistor depends on its material, length, and cross-sectional area, which can be described by the following equation: R = ρ * (L / A) In this equation, R is the resistance, ρ (rho) is the resistivity of the material, L is the length of the resistor, and A is the cross-sectional area. The resistivity (ρ) is an inherent property of the material and remains constant. Since we are only changing the length (L) of the resistor and assuming the cross-sectional area (A) remains constant, we can focus on the relationship between R and L. From the equation, it's clear that resistance is directly proportional to the length of the resistor. Therefore, as the length of the resistor decreases, the resistance it exhibits also decreases. In other words, when Jim makes his resistor shorter, it will have a smaller resistance, allowing electric current to flow more easily through it. This relationship can also be intuitively understood by imagining electric current as water flow. A long and narrow pipe offers more resistance to water flow, whereas a short and wide pipe allows water to flow more freely. The same principle applies to electric current passing through a resistor. When a resistor is shorter, electric current encounters less opposition or resistance, resulting in a smaller resistance value for the component."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle), who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment of Faisal's camp, and leave. Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interest.Brighton advises Faisal to retreat to Yenbo after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies.

Derrick Powell, Sr., and Derrick Powell, Jr., have been charged with sexual battery and assault, respectively, while the other five men have been charged with crimes related to the illegal trafficking of the teenager. The survivors of such atrocities are left with severe emotional trauma, highlighting the urgent need to address human trafficking and sexual exploitation in our communities. Trafficking and Abuse against the Teenager Investigators found that the teenager was shuttled from one home to another, forced to engage in sexual acts with multiple men. Prosecutors stated that on two separate occasions, she was forced to have sex with up to eight men at once. The trafficking and sexual abuse of the young girl highlights the appalling realities that countless victims face in the dark world of exploitation and human trafficking. Rescue and Identification Fortunately, the girl was found and rescued by the authorities, leading to a massive crackdown on the criminals involved in her trafficking. With her help, investigators were able to identify and locate the homes where she was held, ultimately leading to the arrest of the seven men involved in her abuse and trafficking. The Significance of the Case The trial of Derrick Powell, Sr., Derrick Powell, Jr., and the other five men has brought this shocking case of trafficking and sexual exploitation into the public eye. As charges are filed and investigations continue, this case serves as a startling reminder of the horrific crimes that are committed against vulnerable individuals in our society, even and especially within our own communities. Combating Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation The arrest of these men is undoubtedly a significant milestone in the ongoing battle against human trafficking and sexual exploitation. However, there is still much work to be done to eradicate this heinous crime and protect the at-risk population within our communities. It is crucial that we collectively raise awareness about the insidious nature of human trafficking and take steps to ensure that those involved in this depraved activity are brought to justice. National and local government agencies, law enforcement, and non-profit organizations must work together to implement preventative measures and provide adequate support services to victims. These may include education campaigns to raise awareness, increased surveillance to detect and disrupt trafficking operations, and comprehensive rehabilitation programs to help survivors of trafficking rebuild their lives. Conclusion This case of the father and son duo and their five accomplices sent a ripple through society, reminding us of the grim reality that human trafficking and sexual exploitation continue to persist in our communities. It is imperative that we remain vigilant in our efforts to stamp out these crimes and provide support for the survivors, who have faced unimaginable trauma. This collaborative effort by the community, law enforcement, and policymakers can ultimately help prevent future cases and enable the identification, arrest, and prosecution of those involved in this reprehensible industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Duchess of Cornwall has hosted a tea party for seriously ill children as part of a week long annual visit to Wales with Prince Charles. Camilla chatted with the youngsters - most of whom were battling life threatening illnesses - as she met with them and their families at the home she shares with Prince Charles while in Wales. The bash, held at a converted barn. on the couple's Llwynywermod estate, was organised by Dreams and Wishes - a voluntary. organisation that makes the dreams and wishes of terminally ill children. come true. Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall visits with Jack Gow and sister Katrionoa as she hosts a tea party for seriously ill young people. The party was held by Prince Charles and Camilla for 'Dreams and Wishes' charity at their home in Llwynywermod, Wales. Camilla chatted with the youngsters- most of whom were battling life threatening illnesses - and their families at the converted barn. Cardiff footballer Nicky Maynard was also invited. Jack Gow, of Cardigan, has a. rare form of cancer called Parameningeal Rhabdomyosarcoma - which causes. tumours behind the eyes. Thanks to Dreams and Wishes, the. 10-year-old had a special treehouse built in his back garden to try and. lift his spirits during a stay in hospital. Mother Sylvie said the generous gift touched her family - and gave Manchester United fan Jack a big boost. 'It meant a great deal especially because he had just a relapse at that point,' she said. 'The treehouse is on 7ft stilts and he loves the view out across the sea. 'And we will treasure days like today. - getting invited into a tea party with the Duchess - as we want to. create as many happy memories for Jack as we can.' Dreams and Wishes founder Tony Curtis said days like today where what his charity lived for. Cardiff-based Mr Curtis, who has. helped more than 120 families over the past two years, said: 'We're. quite a small organisation, and really rely on the goodwill of people to. make youngsters' dreams come true. 'But being small can be to our. advantage as we can get things done very quickly - there's no network of. managers I have to go through to get something done.' As well as being treated to a. performance of Disney songs from Carmarthen Youth Opera, those attending. the bash were also given a special gift - a Welsh Guard teddy bear -. each from the Duchess. The Duchess of Cornwall visits has her picture taken by seven-year-old Neave Ritchie, of Pontypridd. The budding photographer, who has continually battled cancer from the age of three, got some of the best snaps of the tea party with her digital SLR. The young girl reportedly had the Duchess in fits of laughter, after the youngster walked up to her and asked for a close-up photo. And one youngster who definitely made an impression on the Duchess was seven-year-old Neave Ritchie, of Pontypridd. The budding photographer, who has. continually battled cancer from the age of three, got some of the best. snaps of the tea party with her digital SLR. She had the Duchess in fits of laughter, after the youngster walked up to her and asked for a close-up photo. Mother Emma, 33, said her daughter has always had a keen interest in photography. 'We went to a trip to the House of. Commons recently and Neave ended up telling the Speaker of the House to. move further to one side so she could get a better shot,' she added. 'I'll often pick up my camera and. notice there's lots of photos taken on there at knee height - which. means Neave has got the camera. And Ms Ritchie - who also brought. along eldest daughter Leiah, 13 - said the photos from today will be. taking pride of place back at home. She added: 'Neave's an amazing little. girl who's been through so much - so I can't thank everyone enough for. giving us a special day.' And before the Duchess made her. farewell, she was presented with a plaque bearing the name Llwynywermod. as well as a young oak tree. She said: 'Thank you. Every time I look at this tree in years to come I will think the great time we had today.' It comes as Prince Charles began his week-long annual visit to Wales - with locals near his holiday home in Carmarthenshire expressing their pride at his return. The royals visit continues today with a series of engagements in north Wales. And on Wednesday they will visit the. BBC Wales drama studios at Roath Lock in Cardiff Bay to mark the 50th. anniversary of Doctor Who, during which they will meet members of the. cast including departing doctor Matt Smith. Prince Charles began his week-long annual visit to Wales - with locals near his holiday home in Carmarthenshire expressing their pride at his return. Since 2008, the Prince of Wales has called the small rural village of Myddfai home for seven days. But rather than shut the doors and draw the curtains - on what is officially classed as his holiday - the Prince and The Duchess of Cornwall have gone on regular visits to communities and projects across the region. Llandovery town councillor Nigel Burgess said locals now viewed the Prince as of one of their own. He said: 'We're just a small town in the heart of rural Wales, so the fact that our future king chose this neck of the woods to be his home means a great deal to people. 'It's not only put us and local good causes on the map, but it's given us a tremendous sense of pride.'It means all the more because this is supposed to be the Prince's holiday - but he's never put his feet up and locked himself in his holiday home.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the alias of the volcano that has deposits rich in palagonite? , can you please find it? North Sister, also known as \\"Faith\\", is the oldest and most highly eroded of the three, with zigzagging rock pinnacles between glaciers. It is a shield volcano that overlays a more ancient shield volcano named Little Brother. North Sister is 5 miles (8 km) wide, and its summit elevation is 10,090 feet (3,075 m). Consisting primarily of basaltic andesite, it has a more mafic composition than the other two volcanoes. Its deposits are rich in palagonite and red and black cinders, and they are progressively more iron-rich the younger they are. North Sister's lava flows demonstrate similar compositions throughout the mountain's long eruptive history. The oldest lava flows on North Sister have been dated to roughly 311,000 years ago, though the oldest reliably dated deposits are approximately 119,000 years old. Estimates place the volcano's last eruption at 46,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene.North Sister possesses more dikes than any similar Cascade peak, caused by lava intruding into pre-existing rocks. Many of these dikes were pushed aside by the intrusion of a 980-foot (300 m)-wide volcanic plug. The dikes and plug were exposed by centuries of erosion. At one point, the volcano stood more than 11,000 feet (3,400 m) high, but erosion reduced this volume by a quarter to a third. The plug is now exposed and forms North Sister's summits at Prouty Peak and the South Horn.

Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Paragraph: Two neighboring towns used different approaches to agriculture. Big town used pesticides and fertilizers, while Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which town had less growth of algae because of fertilizer? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Small town had less growth of algae because of fertilizer. The reason for this is that Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods, which are more environmentally friendly and do not rely on chemical inputs like synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Instead, they focus on utilizing natural processes and sustainable practices to maintain soil fertility and control pests. As a result, there is less likelihood of nutrient-rich runoff entering water bodies and contributing to the growth of algae. In contrast, Big town used pesticides and fertilizers, which are known to have detrimental effects on the environment when not managed correctly. They can easily be picked up by rainwater and carried as runoff to nearby rivers or lakes, where they can lead to excessive nutrient levels, known as eutrophication. This, in turn, causes an overgrowth of water plants and algae, which can eventually lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. The practice of using chemicals in agriculture not only affects the water bodies but also has the potential to infiltrate groundwater sources. When contaminated water comes up in water wells, it poses a risk to human health, as consuming polluted water can lead to illnesses. Therefore, considering the differences in agricultural practices between the two towns, it is clear that Small town had less growth of algae due to their adoption of permaculture principles and organic farming methods, which are more sustainable and less likely to contribute to pollution in nearby water bodies. This approach also helps in preserving groundwater quality and promoting a healthier ecosystem for both humans and aquatic life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis.

This much-anticipated gathering has drawn the attention of both domestic and international stakeholders, as the decision could have far-reaching consequences for bilateral relations and global security dynamics. The US-India nuclear deal, formally known as the \\"123 Agreement,\\" was initially signed in 2005 to facilitate nuclear cooperation between the two countries. It seeks to provide India with civil nuclear technology, in return for the country placing a majority of its nuclear facilities under international safeguards. However, despite assurances from both governments, the deal has been met with skepticism and opposition by various factions in India, who have raised concerns over the implications for national sovereignty and the potential impact on regional stability. As the Indian Parliament gears up for the confidence vote, politicians from across the political spectrum have been voicing their opinions, with some fiercely opposing the deal while others lend their support. The primary argument against the deal is that it may compromise India's ability to develop its nuclear weapons program, given the inspection requirements that come with accepting international safeguards. Proponents of the agreement, on the other hand, argue that it would serve as a strategic asset for India, helping the country achieve energy security while also unlocking the door to new technological advancements. They maintain that the safeguards would only apply to civilian nuclear facilities, leaving India's defense capabilities and strategic autonomy unscathed. The outcome of the confidence vote is expected to have significant ramifications, both domestically and internationally. If the Indian government successfully secures parliamentary backing for the nuclear deal, it would mark a key milestone in the strengthening of US-India ties. However, if it fails to gather enough support, the deal may be pushed into uncertainty, which could ultimately undermine the broader strategic partnership between the two nations. As the world watches closely, Indian lawmakers now hold the key to a decision that may well determine the future of this landmark nuclear agreement. With regional stability, international security, and the course of US-India relations hanging in the balance, the confidence vote is set to be a pivotal moment in the unfolding saga of the US-India nuclear deal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Queen Gorgo of Sparta tells her men about the Battle of Marathon, in which King Darius of Persia was killed by General Themistocles of Athens ten years earlier. Darius' son, Xerxes, witnesses his father's death, and is advised to not continue the war, since only \\"the gods can defeat the Greeks\\". Darius' naval commander, Artemisia, claims that Darius' last words were in fact a challenge and sends Xerxes on a journey through the desert. Xerxes finally reaches a cave and bathes in an otherworldly liquid, emerging as the 8-feet tall \\"god-King\\". He returns to Persia and declares war on Greece to avenge his father.As Xerxes's forces advance towards Thermopylae, Themistocles meets with the council and convinces them to provide him with a fleet to engage the Persians at the sea. Themistocles (the Athenian general) then travels to Sparta to ask King Leonidas for help, but is informed by Dilios that Leonidas is consulting the Oracle, and Gorgo is reluctant to side with Athens. Themistocles later reunites with his old friend Scyllas, who infiltrated the Persian troops and learned Artemisia was born Greek, but defected to Persia as her family was raped and murdered by Greek hoplites and she was taken as a sex slave, and subsequently left for dead in the streets. She was rescued and adopted by a Persian emissary. Her lust for vengeance gained the attention of King Darius and he made her a naval commander after she killed many of his enemies. Themistocles also learns that Leonidas has marched to fight the Persians with only 300 men.Themistocles leads his fleet of fifty warships and several thousand men, which include Scyllas, Scyllas' son Calisto and Themistocles' right-hand man Aeskylos to the Aegean Sea, starting the Battle of Artemisium. They ram their ships into the Persian ships, charge them, slaughtering several soldiers before retreating from the sinking Persian ships. The following day, the Greeks feign a retreat and lead a group of Persian ships into a crevice, where they become stuck. The Greeks charge the Persian ships from the cliffs above and kill more Persians. Impressed with Themistocles' skills, Artemisia brings him onto her ship where she has sex with him in an attempt to convince him to join the Persians as her second-in-command. He refuses, causing her to push him aside and swear revenge on him.The Persians spill tar into the sea and send suicide bombers to swim to and board the Greek ships with their flame bombs. Artemisia and her men fire flaming arrows and torches to ignite the tar, but an Athenian manages to kill one of the Persians, who falls into the tar carrying a torch, causing ships from both sides to explode. Themistocles is thrown into the sea by an explosion and nearly drowns before being rescued by Aeskylos, and stands by Scyllas' side as he succumbs to his injuries. Believing Themistocles to be dead, Artemisia and her forces withdraw. After recovering from his injuries, Themistocles learns that only a few hundred of his warriors and six of his ships survived the disastrous attack executed by Artemisia.Daxos, an Arcadian general, tells Themistocles that Leonidas and his 300 men have been killed after Ephialtes betrays the Greeks to Xerxes. Themistocles returns to Athens and confronts Ephialtes. The deformed Spartan traitor reveals that Xerxes plans to attack and burn Athens to the ground. Ephialites is regretful of his actions, and is welcoming death. Themistocles spares him instead, so he can warn Xerxes that the Greek forces are gathering at Salamis. He then visits Gorgo in Sparta while she is mourning Leonidas' death to ask for her help, but she is too overcome with grief. Before leaving, Themistocles returns Leonidas' sword, which had been delivered to him by Ephialtes under Xerxes's orders, and urges Gorgo to avenge Leonidas.In Athens, Xerxes' army is laying waste when Ephialtes arrives to deliver Themistocles' message. Upon learning he is alive, Artemisia leaves to ready her entire navy for battle. Xerxes suggests a more cautious plan but she still leaves for battle, ignoring Xerxes' advice. The remaining Greek ships charge into the Persians ships, and the two armies battle, beginning the decisive Battle of Salamis. Themistocles and Artemisia fight, which ends in a stalemate with both receiving severe injuries.At this moment Gorgo, who had been narrating the tale to the Spartans, arrives at the battle along with ships from numerous Greek city states including Delphi, Thebes, Olympia, Arcadia, and Sparta, all of them uniting against the surrounded Persians. Daxos leads the Arcadian army while Themistocles urges Artemisia to surrender. Xerxes, watching the battle from a cliff, turns his back on her, acknowledging his invasion has ended in defeat. Artemisia tries to kill Themistocles one last time but is killed as he stabs her through the stomach. Themistocles and Gorgo take a moment to silently acknowledge one another's alliance as the remaining Persians charge while Dilios leads the assault. The three then charge at the opposing Persians with the whole Greek army., Question: Who is Themistocles? Output:","completion":"the Athenian general"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it is not negative; rather, it is more of a neutral emotion. 3. Context: The context of the tweet is minimal, as it only conveys the person's preparation for a busy day ahead. Due to the lack of additional information, it is difficult to discern the exact context of the tweet. It could be a recurring theme in this person's life, or perhaps it is an exception to their usual routine. 4.

Movie plot: Is everything random \\"or is there a Grand Design?\\" muses Albert Einstein at the opening of the film. And we are left with the ultimate conclusion that where true love is concerned at least, the answer is a resounding \\"Yes\\" to a Grand Design. An easy-going garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins), meets Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), a successful Princeton University mathematics doctoral candidate, as she comes into the garage, accompanied by her resistant and critical English fiancÃ©, acerbic experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). There is an immediate \\"electric\\" connection which Ed recognizes, but she is not yet aware. Ed sees his future, briefly, and Catherine is a major part of it; they are married, and have children together. \\"How long will all of this take?\\" asks Catherine, referring to the car repair, and Ed, thinking about their future life together, replies, \\"That's up to you\\". His life purpose has suddenly been decided by a force of nature greater than himself. Finding a watch she left at the garage, Ed travels to her address and finds himself face to face with Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau), who is Catherine's uncle.[1] Albertâportrayed as a fun-loving geniusâand his mischievous friends, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht (Joseph Maher), Kurt GÃ¶del (Lou Jacobi), and Boris Podolsky (Gene Saks), see Ed as someone who would be better suited for Catherine. The four of them try to help Ed look and sound like a scientist (i.e., a \\"wunderkind\\" in physics) temporarily, in order to garner Catherine's attention for Ed, while at the same time trying to convince Catherine that life is not all about the mind, but is also about the heart. James's heart is virtually non-existent, while Ed's heart is virtually limitless.

A local radio station posted a video of at least 10 rat-infested trailers outside a state elections office Friday (see it here), sparking reactions from officials. \\"I agree, it should have been handed out as soon as possible,\\" says Maj. Paul Dahlen, the National Guard spokesman. But he says some of those donations came after the National Guard's mission ended in May. The head of the elections council, Nicolás Gautier, says he's been calling the National Guard asking when they planned to distribute the much-needed goods. \\"Whatever was left after the National Guard left was put in those containers,\\" says Gautier. \\"In one of these containers was food for dogs and apparently several of the boxes were broken. After the placement in the van, that brings a lot of rats and it infected everything.\\" The find came only a day after Puerto Rican officials acknowledged 1,427 deaths \\"more than normal\\" occurred over four months following Hurricanes Irma and Maria, CBS News reports—a far cry from the previous official Maria death count of 64, notes the Times. Meanwhile, about 300 unidentified bodies await autopsy at a Puerto Rico morgue, some stored in 18-wheeler trucks outside. \\"We were taken to one of the trailers,\\" says a CBS reporter. \\"The door was open.

Some people who were supposed to help pass out the supplies said they didn't know about these trailers or that they came after they stopped helping. The person in charge of the place with the trailers said he kept asking for help to give the stuff away, but no one came. It's very important because a lot of people got hurt or died during the storm, and they really needed food, water, and other things to help them.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) journeys to the remote Hebridean island, Summerisle, to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison (Gerry Cowper), about whom he has received an anonymous letter. Howie, a devout Christian, is disturbed to find the islanders paying homage to the pagan Celtic gods of their ancestors. They copulate openly in the fields, include children as part of the May Day celebrations, teach children of the phallic association of the maypole, and place toads in their mouths to cure sore throats. The Islanders, including Rowan's mother (Irene Sunters), appear to be attempting to thwart his investigation by claiming that Rowan never existed. While staying at the Green Man Inn, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the annual harvest, each featuring a young girl as the May Queen. The photograph of the most recent celebration is suspiciously missing; the landlord tells him it was broken. The landlord's beautiful daughter, Willow (Britt Eklund), attempts to seduce Howie, but he refuses to have premarital sex. After seeing Rowan's burial plot, Howie meets the island's leader, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), grandson of a Victorian agronomist, to obtain permission for an exhumation. Lord Summerisle explains that his grandfather developed strains of fruit trees that would prosper in Scotland's climate, and encouraged the belief that old gods would use the new strains to bring prosperity to the island. Over the next several generations, the island's inhabitants fully embraced the pagan religion. Howie finds the missing harvest photograph, showing Rowan standing amidst empty boxes. His research reveals that when there is a poor harvest, the islanders make a human sacrifice to ensure that the next will be bountiful.

Moreover, the title evokes a sense of danger and urgency, as it suggests that the truth about Summerisle and its pagan rituals involves potentially deadly consequences. This intrigue will likely pique the interest of potential viewers, drawing them into Sergeant Howie's quest for answers and his mission to save Rowan from her impending sacrifice. Overall, the title \\"Pagan's Harvest: The Secret of Summerisle\\" encapsulates the central conflict, themes, and atmosphere of the film, effectively inviting audiences into this maddening and mesmerizing tale of ancient practices, hidden truths, and one man's pursuit to save a young girl from a chilling destiny."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who failed to be convinced that The Planets should be played in full? ? Holst was given a spectacular send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, \\"Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'.\\" There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \\"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\\".

Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Once Upon A Caesar\\" \\"Once Upon A Caesar\\" is a coming-of-age drama film centered around the life of Richard, a teenage boy with a natural aptitude for English literature, particularly in the works of William Shakespeare. The movie opens in a small suburban town in Ohio, where Richard, a high school junior, is reciting lines from Julius Caesar, in his English class. The teacher is astounded by Richard's prodigious understanding of the text, adding a fresh perspective to the class. Isolated as a bookworm by his friends, Richard finds solace in the world of literature. News about his remarkable interpretation of the play spreads around the school, thus attracting the attention of Candida, a popular senior girl who is directing the school's drama production. Candida, recognizing Richard's passion and talent, invites him to participate in the upcoming school's rendition of Julius Caesar. Richard is then embarked on a new journey in his otherwise quiet life. At first, he's hesitant due to stage fear and disdain for the spotlight. However, with Candida's encouragement, he agrees to step out of his comfort zone and joins the drama team, reading for Brutus. Amid his newfound popularity, Richard grapples with his changing social status and starts attracting the disdain of Redmond, the school's leading bully and the drama club's ousted star. The drama rehearsals parallel the plot of Julius Caesar, as behind-the-scenes conflicts, friendships' betrayals, and alliances form. Redmond, similar to Cassius in the play, becomes increasingly bitter and starts plotting against Richard out of jealousy. However, this personal conflict is not the only problem Richard faces. As he delves deeper into the character of Brutus, he perceives a reflection into his own morality, the concept of loyalty and the harsh consequences of betrayal. These themes mirror his real life, as his old friends feel betrayed by his newfound popularity and he also questions his loyalty towards them. As the day of the performance approaches, the tension between Richard, his old friends, and Redmond reaches its peak. Redmond, in an act of desperation, sabotages Richard's final rehearsal which results in Richard suffering a stage accident, echoing the fate of Julius Caesar. Although upset, the incident helps Richard discover his sense of identity and worth. Gallantly, Richard decides not to let the incident dissuade him and overcome his stage fear. He learns to reconcile with fame and stand up to Redmond, just like Brutus mustered the courage to confront Caesar's ghost. His friendships regain stability as he makes amends with his past, letting them know he hasn't forgotten where he came from. \\"Once Upon a Caesar\\" concludes with Richard's riveting performance on the opening night. His compelling and profound interpretation of Brutus leaves the audience, including Redmond, astounded, teaching everyone a lesson about resilience, friendship, and devotion to passion. Thoroughly woven with intricate themes from the characters and plots of Julius Caesar, the movie explores intricacies of teenage dynamics, friendships, jealousy, courage, and self-discovery while subtly interspersing the essence of Shakespeare's works in a contemporary world of high school drama."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them? A little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft.

England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Weardale is a dale, or valley, of the east side of the Pennines in County Durham, England. Large parts of Weardale fall within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) the second largest AONB in England and Wales. The upper valley is surrounded by high fells (up to O.D. at Burnhope Seat) and heather grouse moors. The River Wear flows through Weardale before reaching Bishop Auckland and then Durham, meeting the sea at Sunderland. - County Durham (locally ), occasionally Durhamshire, is a county in North East England. The county town is Durham, a cathedral city, whilst the largest settlement is Darlington. It borders Tyne and Wear to the north east, Northumberland to the north, Cumbria to the west and North Yorkshire to the south. Historically, the county included southern Tyne and Wear, including Gateshead and Sunderland. - Wearside is an area of North East England centred on the continuous urban area of Sunderland by the River Wear, and in the wider sense, including separate neighbouring settlements such as Seaham. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes.

B). wear another longer dress under it.....I think the answer is","completion":"Both A and B can help make a dress more modest, but the answer that might be more reasonable is A) wear leggings underneath it. Now imagine, you have a short dress and you want to make sure it covers more of your legs. Option A – wearing leggings – is like putting on a pair of soft, stretchy pants under your dress. This will cover your legs, make you feel more comfortable, and your short dress will look more modest. Option B works too, but it could be a little tricky, as it might not look as nice or be comfortable. It's like wearing two dresses at the same time, the short dress you have and another longer dress under it. It will cover more of your legs, but it could make you feel too warm or the two dresses might not match or fit well together. So, for many people, wearing leggings underneath the dress (Option A) might be the more reasonable way to make a short dress more modest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In architecture, what name is given to a supporting figure in the form of a draped female figure?","completion":"In architecture, the name given to a supporting figure in the form of a draped female figure is a \\"caryatid\\" (plural: caryatids). Caryatids are sculpted female figures that function both as decorative elements and structural supports, effectively serving as a type of ornamental column or pillar. They can be found in classical Greek and Roman architecture as well as in later architectural styles that borrowed from these traditions, such as Renaissance and Neoclassical architecture. The origin of caryatids can be traced back to ancient Greece, particularly to the city of Karyai (or Caryae) in the Peloponnese. This city was known for its beautiful and skillful dancers who performed at religious ceremonies. The women of Karyai were believed to have special powers, and they were revered and honored as symbols of strength and beauty. Therefore, this explains why the sculpted female figures have a strong connection with the city's name. The most famous example of caryatids can be found on the south porch of the Erechtheion, a temple dedicated to Athena and Poseidon on the Acropolis in Athens, Greece. This remarkable temple, constructed during the 5th century BCE, includes six exquisitely carved female figures that support the entablature and replace the more traditional columns. Their skillful execution and elegant design, characterized by Classical Greek values such as balance, harmony, and naturalism, have made them symbols of Greek architecture and artistic achievement. Other notable examples of caryatids in ancient Greek architecture can be found in the Treasury of the Siphnians in Delphi and the Temple of Apollo in Didyma. Their use in ancient Rome includes the Forum of Augustus in Rome and the Baths of Diocletian. Caryatids have also been incorporated in architectural designs during Italy's Renaissance period, such as the Villa Borghese in Rome, and later in many Neoclassical buildings. When using a Caryatid in an architectural design, several considerations are taken into account. The female figure should be proportionately balanced and aesthetically pleasing, with a natural stance and posture that conveys the impression of supporting the weight above. Often, the figures are shown as elegant and poised, bearing the entablature gracefully. The sculptor must also take care to balance the weight load, ensuring that the figure's positioning and internal structure are secure and appropriately designed to bear the required architectural stress. In summary, a caryatid is a draped female figure used as a supporting element in architecture. They represent an innovative combination of artistry and engineering, blending structural support with visual appeal. Caryatids have been utilized throughout history in various architectural styles, most notably in ancient Greece and Rome, and continue to be an enduring and celebrated feature of artistic architecture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which vehicle needed to less energy to power it bulky vehicle or sleek vehicle? A:","completion":"A: In this scenario, we can break down the steps to determine which vehicle needed less energy: Step 1: Identify the factors affecting energy consumption - Vehicle weight - Aerodynamics - Other factors (such as engine efficiency, tire friction, etc.) Step 2: Compare the given vehicles - The sleek and aerodynamic vehicle is more streamlined and likely lighter. - The bulky vehicle has more resistance against the air due to its shape and possibly a heavier weight. Step 3: Evaluate their energy needs - The sleek vehicle, due to its better aerodynamics and possibly lighter weight, encounters less air resistance and needs less energy to maintain the same speed as the bulky vehicle. - The bulky vehicle, with its less streamlined shape and potentially heavier weight, experiences more air resistance and thus requires more energy to maintain the same speed as the sleek vehicle. Step 4: Determine which vehicle needs less energy Since the sleek and aerodynamic vehicle has less air resistance, it requires less energy to travel the same distance and maintain the same speed as the bulky vehicle.

Options: A. catch cold B. feel lonely C. enter college D. graduate from high school E. finish junior high The answer to this question is:","completion":"D. graduate from high school Before going into tertiary education, a person must first graduate from high school. Tertiary education, also referred to as post-secondary education, includes various levels of study beyond secondary education, such as colleges, universities, trade schools, and other institutions. High school usually provides the necessary foundation and pre-requisites needed to enter these higher education institutions. In most countries, high school or secondary education is a compulsory stage of education that follows primary or elementary schooling. High schools typically offer a range of academic and sometimes technical or vocational subjects to prepare students for tertiary education, the workforce, or other endeavors. Graduating from high school usually requires the successful completion of a defined set of courses and exams, resulting in a diploma or certificate. High school graduation is an essential milestone in a person's educational journey and is often seen as a rite of passage into adulthood. It is a major achievement that signifies the end of one phase of life and the beginning of the next. Graduating from high school increases one's chances of obtaining higher-paying jobs, experiencing personal growth and development, and contributing to society's overall progress. Once a person has graduated from high school, they may begin considering various options for entering tertiary education or post-secondary institutions. This might involve researching and applying to colleges or universities, exploring vocation or technical programs, or considering other options like apprenticeships or military service. Selecting the right path requires careful consideration of one's interests, goals, and resources, as well as any entrance requirements, tuition fees, and financial aid options. By graduating from high school and planning their next steps wisely, individuals build the foundation for a successful future in tertiary education or other pursuits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - pull up covers - fall asleep - brush teeth - remove the covers - get laid The answer is \\"pull up covers\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"pull up covers\\" because this is the most appropriate, respectful and logical action to perform under the circumstances described. One must understand the question from a point of consideration and respect towards the girl. The question states that the boy wants to 'get warm' with the girl. In such a context, this would imply physical nearness in a non-sexual manner to facilitate warmth. And in a situation where they are about to go to bed, the action which makes the most sense is to 'pull up covers'. This action allows both individuals to be in close contact, facilitating the sharing of body heat and thus getting warm. The other options provided are either not applicable or not particularly appropriate. Falling asleep does not directly contribute to getting warmer. Brushing teeth is a personal hygiene activity that is important before going to bed but it does not specifically relate to the main objective. Removing the covers will be contrary to the purpose because it would expose them to the ambient room temperature, which might be cooler. The final option 'get laid' is blatantly about sexual activity. It might be assumed that sexual activity will ensure getting warm due to physical exertion but it's not inherently respectful or considerate to interpret the wanting to 'get warm' as instigating sexual activity, especially without implied or expressed consent. This interpretation may not be in line with fostering an atmosphere of respect and consent and thus it is not the most appropriate answer. It is crucial to prioritize respect and consideration when we interpret ambiguous scenarios. Therefore, in this setting, the most appropriate answer to the question would be 'pull up covers'. This creates a warm, comfortable environment by sharing covers and body heat which can foster intimacy in a respectful and consensual manner without assuming or imposing any sexual undertones. In addition, pulling up covers can also be a polite and caring action that can be appreciated and valued in this context. Thus, when one would like to go to bed with a pretty girl and wishes to get warm, pulling up the covers is the responsible, respectful and logical action to take."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Copper, silver and gold are in group 11 of the periodic table, and they share certain attributes: they have one s-orbital electron on top of a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility and electrical conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements do not contribute much to the interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice, such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): How is copper normally supplied?","completion":"Yes, there is an answer to this question: Copper is normally supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Havoc Movie plot: The film begins in a parking lot in which a teenage filmmaker named Eric is attempting to document the faux-gangsta lifestyle enjoyed by Allison Lang and her boyfriend Toby's gang of white upper-class teenagers living in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. A brawl ensues between Toby's gang and another gang, which ends with both sides fleeing just before police arrive. Later that night, Toby's gang goes to a party at Eric's house, and Allison's relationship with Toby as well her other friends Emily and Sam is further revealed. At the end of the party, Allison performs oral sex on her boyfriend. The next day, Allison meets with her father, Stuart, at work to discuss family problems, the awkward conversation revealing the virtually non-existent relationship Allison has with her parents. Afterwards, she and her friends drive downtown into East LA, intent on buying marijuana, eventually encountering Mexican drug dealer Hector and his crew. Toby and Hector make a deal, but Toby believes that Hector did not sell him enough for what he paid, and attempts to confront Hector, who pulls a gun on him, humiliating him in front of his friends. Allison persuades Hector to leave Toby alone. The next night, Allison and her girlfriends return to the location of the drug deal. There, she and her friends once again meet up with Hector and his crew, who invite them to a party at his house. Before they leave, Hector informs Allison of a motel where his crew regularly party, and invites her to stop by if she wishes. The next day, Eric continues his film project at Allison's home, with Allison turning his interview of her into a bizarre mind-game. That evening, Allison meets up with Hector again in a store, and he shows her around his neighborhood, while talking about his family and lifestyle.

A:","completion":"In the context of the movie \\"Havoc,\\" based on the plot you provided, Allison and Emily rolling a die could be symbolic for the various decisions they're making throughout the film. It showcases the element of chance and the unpredictable nature of the choices they make in their lives. The dice rolling may have a few purposes: 1. Demonstrating a loss of control: Just like rolling dice, Allison and Emily's lives seem to be spiraling out of control due to their involvement in risky situations and poor choices. They feel trapped in their current environment and have no real plan for their future. The implication is that their lives are in the hands of fate, and these risky actions and decisions might lead them further into trouble. 2. Providing contrast: Rolling a die is usually associated with games and fun, but in the context of the movie, it can create a powerful contrast between this seemingly innocent action and the dangerous gang-related activities they engage in. This contrast can make viewers question their own role in their lives and whether their actions are leading them on a positive or negative path. 3. Adding tension: Rolling a die can introduce an element of tension due to its unpredictable nature. Since the result of a dice roll is entirely random, it can heighten the suspense for the viewers by emphasizing that anything could happen next. This uncertainty can mirror the atmosphere that Allison and her friends experience as they navigate the unknown territory of the drug dealers and gang members they encounter. 4. Symbolizing peer pressure and conformity: When Allison and Emily roll a die, they might be following the lead of the gang or friends they're with, in an attempt to fit in and conform to their surroundings. This could be a representation of the challenge many teenagers face when trying to define their identity and figure out their direction in life. The dice roll can symbolize the pressure to conform, even with the knowledge that it might result in negative consequences. 5. A decision-making tool: Allison and Emily may use the die to make decisions, reinforcing the lack of control or direction in their lives. Instead of taking responsibility for their choices, they leave their decisions to chance. This reflects how some young people may feel overwhelmed by the decisions they face and seek relief through external forces. In conclusion, Allison and Emily rolling a die could symbolize the chance, unpredictability, and lack of control that they face in their lives. It can also represent the tension between the desire to conform and finding a unique personal identity in a world filled with pressure and temptation. Finally, using a die to make decisions showcases a level of disconnection from taking responsibility for the actions they take in their lives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

PUBLISHED:. 15:01 EST, 19 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 18:11 EST, 19 December 2012. A NBA star has decided to give up his celebratory six-shooter gesture in the wake of the Sandy Hook school massacre. Joakim Noah, 27, who plays for the Chicago Red Bulls, has not used his trademark move since the attack last Friday where 20 children aged six and seven died along with six teaching staff. The player, who earned 11million this year, had celebrated success on the court by miming guns with his index fingers. Scroll down for video. Respect: Chicago Bulls' Joakim Noah reacts during an NBA basketball game against the Philadelphia 76ers on December 12, prior to the Sandy Hook school shootings. During the Bulls last game against Boston Celtics, which the Chicago team won 100-89, Noah did not once make the gesture - or at two other games in the past week. The player had been performing the celebration since the 2010-11 season. He told the New York Post: 'It was kind of like a funny, comical thing. But I guess we’re in a situation right now where it’s not funny.' He said that the high level of gun violence in Chicago added to his decision. On December 14, the star player tweeted: 'This is so f***** up... There needs to be some kind of gun control.. For real.' Joakim Noah has established a charity called Noah's Arc Foundation which helps underprivileged children through sports and arts programs. Tribute: The Bulls player has used the celebration for several seasons until last week when he said it was no longer a 'funny, comical thing' New York Giants receiver Victor Cruz has visited the home of the six-year-old Connecticut shooting victim who was buried in a replica of his jersey. Jack Pinto was among 20 children shot to death Friday in Newtown. Several elementary school-age children played touch football in the front yard of his family's home on Tuesday. Tribute: Victor Cruz's boots for Jack Pinto. Six-year-old Jack was a huge Giants fan and Cruz his favorite player. Many wore Giants jerseys or Newtown football or wrestling shirts as they laughed, smiled and hugged. The children and their families left after several hours. Young fans carried autographed Giants footballs and jerseys. About 45 minutes later, Cruz left the home in an SUV and an escort of five police cruisers, sirens blaring. He later tweeted that he has 'much love to the entire Pinto family. Great people with huge hearts'. Several people leaving the home confirmed Cruz was there. When the New York Giants took on the Atlanta Falcons this past Sunday, Cruz's boots were inscribed with the words 'Jack Pinto, My Hero', 'R.I.P. Jack Pinto' and 'This one is for you'. Cruz later said: 'There's no words that can describe the type of feeling that you get when a kid idolizes you so much that unfortunately they want to put him in the casket with your jersey on. 'I can't even explain it.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1.

Write some highlights for the following article: Nogales, Arizona, is a small city. Just more than 20,000 people live here, according to the 2005 census. But spend a couple of days here with law enforcement, and your head will spin. Almost half of all illegal drugs seized from Mexico last year were seized in the eastern Arizona region, and Nogales is the largest border city in this U.S. border patrol sector. In the past six months, the Border Patrol has seized about 500,000 pounds of illegal drugs here, which is 15 percent higher than the previous six months. Each day, hundreds of people are arrested, mostly for immigration violations but many for drug and weapons crimes. The temporary jail cells in the Border Patrol station in Nogales are often overflowing. The Border Patrol boss in this sector says his agents were assaulted 260 times within the past year. One night this week, we saw the danger and variety of lawbreaking activity experienced here quite vividly. At the immigration checkpoint set up a half-hour north of Nogales on Interstate 19, a semi truck is pulled over when the drug-sniffing dog detects something. The back of the truck is opened, and inside are thousands of tomatoes, but the dog is still not happy. The truck is taken back to the Border Patrol station, and agents climb over the tomatoes. And that's where they find the stash. Bales and bales of dope. Forty bales of marijuana. Nine hundred eight pounds, to be exact. At a street value of 800 a pound, the authorities estimate they kept 720,000 worth of marijuana off the streets. I interview the man arrested for driving the shipment. The operating theory: that he is doing dirty work for one of the Mexican cartels. But the Mexican man tells me he is not scared, because \\"I was just carrying tomatoes.\\" He claims that he knew nothing about the nearly half-ton of pot. The man will be telling that to the judge and could face significant time in an American prison. Illegal drugs consume the day of all law enforcement people here. We drive with the Border Patrol in the late hours of the night and hear a call over the radio that two men have been spotted jumping the border wall with backpacks. The chase is on, and another dog is brought to the area. The men disappear, but the dog picks up a scent in the heavy, hilly brush. Sarah the drug-sniffing dog is taught to sit when she finds something. She suddenly sits and then jumps on what looks like bushes. It turns out the bushes are actually attached to sacks of marijuana. Two 25-pound sacks full of pot. They were abandoned by the men when they ran away after being spotted. Street value, at least 40,000. Ray Rivera, the agent who works with Sarah, told me that over the past two years, Sarah has found nearly 7,000 pounds of pot. But Rivera also is pretty heroic. Just a couple of weeks ago, he was shot in the leg when a man he was chasing committed suicide. The bullet passed through the man's face and into Rivera's knee. Law enforcement life here is not for the squeamish. Before we leave this area, we go to a rural area west of Nogales where we hear illegal immigrants and drug couriers often try to get into the United States. When we get there, we see why. The tall border fence abruptly ends as it gets close to a small mountain, but there is plenty of space for people to squeeze into the United States. We wander about 10 feet into Mexico to look at some of the clothes, water bottles and cigarette boxes that people have left behind. As we get ready to leave, we see a Border Patrol vehicle zooming towards us. They don't know we're with CNN; they think we may be criminals. One of the four agents points his rifle at us and demands that we keep our hands in plain sight. They search our car, and we tell them who we are and what we're doing. They say they spotted us because of their long-range video cameras. They tell us to give them a heads up next time we go exploring, and all is well. The agents did their job well. But there are only so many of them and an immense amount of border. After spending time with these agents, it's easy to see how sometimes what they do feels like a thankless task. Highlights:","completion":"- Nogales, Arizona is the largest border city in the eastern Arizona region, with almost half of all illegal drugs seized from Mexico last year being confiscated there. - The Border Patrol has seized about 500,000 pounds of illegal drugs in the past six months, a 15% increase from the previous period.

This article: The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin.

While attempting to board a plane back to the United States with his girlfriend, Billy is arrested by Turkish police on high alert due to fear of terrorist attacks. He is strip-searched, photographed and questioned. After a while, a shadowy American (who is never named, but is nicknamed \\"Tex\\" by Billy due to his thick Texan accent) arrives, takes Billy to a police station and translates for Billy for one of the detectives. On questioning Billy tells them that he bought the hashish from a taxicab driver, and offers to help the police track him down in exchange for his release.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

Q: What determines which type of precipitation falls? Choices: - air pressure - air currents - ground temperature - air temperature A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"air temperature. The type of precipitation that falls, such as rain, snow, sleet, or freezing rain, is primarily determined by the air temperature at different altitudes, as well as at the ground level. Here's a brief explanation: 1. Rain: Rain occurs when the air temperature remains above freezing (0°C, 32°F) throughout the entire atmosphere, from the cloud level down to the ground. The precipitation falls as liquid droplets. 2. Snow: Snow forms when the air temperature is below freezing at the cloud level and remains below freezing down to the ground. Water vapor in the clouds freezes into ice crystals, which then collect and stick together to form snowflakes. 3. Sleet: Sleet, also known as ice pellets, occurs when snowflakes pass through a shallow layer of air with temperatures above freezing and partially melt. The snowflakes then encounter a lower layer of subfreezing air just above the ground, causing the melted portion to refreeze into small ice pellets. 4. Freezing rain: Freezing rain is caused by a similar process to sleet. However, the layer of air with temperatures above freezing is thicker, causing the snowflakes to melt entirely into raindrops. When the raindrops reach the ground or other surfaces below freezing, they freeze upon contact and create a layer of ice. While these are the primary factors that determine the type of precipitation, other elements such as air pressure, air currents, and ground temperature can play roles in the development and intensity of precipitation events. Nonetheless, air temperature remains the most critical factor in determining the type of precipitation that falls."},{"prompt":"Q: Casey came to school, but forgot the presentation.

They don't know what to do when it doesn't work. I think there is huge potential, so I have designed some for them. The ability to connect to friends, who remember the same movies, news and music, is really important, especially as people get older. They end up in retirement homes and they aren't always close to their friends. Allowing the network to help them connect with friends and family members is a really powerful thing. My wife likes using the Internet, although it took me years to get her to use e-mail. She was born with normal hearing, but lost it when she was three years old. She was totally deaf for many years until 53 when she got ear implants .They work really well. That is a big change for her. Before then, her friends couldn't call her on the phone, so they insisted that she use e-mails to communicate with them. The younger people don't even think of this as technology. It's just there, and they use it .There's been a very interesting change in communication styles between the old and the young .A woman named Sharryturkle wrote about this phenomenon .There are some kids who are now in their teens and are tending not to make phone calls. And they think of e-mail as old-fashioned and slow. The reason why teens don't make phone calls seems to be that they don't know what to say. When they call they often pause for a while. On the other hand, texting is considered proper, and it's OK if you don't answer. You might have been distracted .It's not considered rude, but it's considered unusual if you're in this kind of voice conversation and simply stop talling.

Another crucial point mentioned is that, unlike with voice conversations, it's considered socially acceptable not to reply immediately to a text message – it could be understood that the recipient was distracted.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: In what year is the movie set? Title: Good Night, and Good Luck. Movie plot: Set in 1953, during the early days of television broadcast journalism. Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) and his dedicated staff â headed by his co-producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) and reporter Joseph Wershba (Robert Downey, Jr.) in the CBS newsroomâdefy corporate and sponsorship pressures, and discredit the tactics used by Joseph McCarthy during his crusade to root out Communist elements within the government. Murrow first defends Milo Radulovich, who is facing separation from the U.S. Air Force because of his sister's political leanings and because his father is subscribed to a Serbian newspaper. Murrow makes a show on McCarthy attacking him. A very public feud develops when McCarthy responds by accusing Murrow of being a communist. Murrow is accused of having been a member of the leftist union Industrial Workers of the World, which Murrow claimed was false. In this climate of fear and reprisal, the CBS crew carries on and their tenacity ultimately strikes a historic blow against McCarthy. Historical footage also shows the questioning of Annie Lee Moss, a Pentagon communication worker accused of being a communist based on her name appearing on a list seen by an FBI infiltrator of the American Communist Party. The film's subplots feature Joseph and Shirley Wershba, recently married staffers, having to hide their marriage to save their jobs at CBS as well as the suicide of Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) who had been accused in print of being a Communist. The film is framed by performance of the speech given by Murrow to the Radio and Television News Directors Association in 1958, in which Murrow harshly admonishes his audience not to squander the potential of television to inform and educate the public, so that it does not become only \\"wires and lights in a box\\".[2] Answer:","completion":"The movie \\"Good Night, and Good Luck\\" is set in 1953."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008. Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person whose mother described his regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays is Johnston.

Question: Which of the following is a sign of intelligence: ability to learn, feeding on plants, or smaller than a cat? Context: In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger relative to the rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.

They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him. At the end of the lesson Jody was packing her stuff up and didn't know what to do with the bottle of white-out, so she tossed it out the window of the classroom. Dara had seen her do it, and thought it was just so cool. Jody had done it not in the hope of getting attention, because no one was paying attention, they were all packing up their own crap as fast as possible; she'd just done it.

Process: - You inhale - Your diaphragm moves down - Your lungs have more room - Your lungs fill with air - You exhale - Your diaphragm moves back up - Carbon dioxide is exhaled - You start the process over again. suppose air is cleared in the lung happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"If the air is cleared in the lung, meaning the lungs are not retaining as much inhaled air as they should, this will lead to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. The supposed perturbation in this case would be directly impacting a step of the process. Here's a detailed explanation: The process of respiration, as described above, involves inhaling oxygen-rich air into the lungs and exhaling carbon dioxide. The oxygen inhaled is needed to supply the body's tissues and cells with the required amount of oxygen, while the carbon dioxide, a waste product, is removed from the body through exhalation. When the air in the lungs is cleared, it indicates that the lungs may not be holding and processing the inhaled air optimally. This can be due to the collapsing of air sacs (alveoli) or other issues like lung damage or respiratory illnesses, which directly impact the critical step of gas exchange. Gas exchange is the process where oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide from the bloodstream diffuses into the lungs to be exhaled. The efficiency of gas exchange depends on factors like lung surface area, the thickness of the respiratory membrane, and the partial pressure difference of the gases. If the air is cleared, and the lungs are less effective in exchanging gas, it leads to a direct impact on the process of respiratory gas exchange. As a result, a smaller amount of oxygen is delivered to the bloodstream. This can cause the body's tissues and cells to receive an inadequate amount of oxygen, which may lead to hypoxia or reduced oxygen supply to meet the body's needs. This can further affect cellular metabolism and overall organ function. In summary, the supposed perturbation in the given scenario of the air being cleared in the lung is directly impacting a step of the process, specifically the step involving the gas exchange in the alveoli of the lung. This direct impact causes a smaller amount of oxygen to be delivered to the bloodstream, leading to reduced oxygen availability for the body's cells and tissues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work. The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

Please answer the following question: Information: - Sir John Alexander Macdonald (11 January 1815 6 June 1891) was the first Prime Minister of Canada (18671873, 18781891). The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, he had a political career which spanned almost half a century. He drank heavily, and in 1873 was voted out during the Pacific Scandal, in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Pacific Railway. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy, and building the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Economic growth was slow during his years in office, as Canada verged on stagnation; many residents migrated to the fast-growing United States. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from Ottawa. His most controversial move was to approve the execution of Métis leader Louis Riel for treason in 1885; it alienated many Francophones. - Charles Joseph \\"Joe\\" Clark, (born June 5, 1939) is a Canadian statesman, businessman, writer, and politician who served as the 16th Prime Minister of Canada, from June 4, 1979, to March 3, 1980. - Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau (; October 18, 1919 September 28, 2000), better known as Pierre Trudeau or Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was a Canadian politician who served as the 15th Prime Minister of Canada from 19681979 and 19801984. He is the 3rd longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history (behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald), having served for 15 years, 164 days. - The Conservative Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Tories, is a political party in Canada. It is positioned on the right of the Canadian political spectrum. The party's leader from 2004 to 2015 was Stephen Harper, who served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015. - The Liberal Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Grits, is the oldest federal political party in Canada. The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum. The Liberal Party is traditionally positioned to the left of the Conservative Party of Canada and to the right of the New Democratic Party (NDP). - The Canadian federal election of 1979 was held on May 22 , 1979 to elect members of the Canadian House of Commons of the 31st Parliament of Canada . It resulted in the defeat of the Liberal Party of Canada after 11 years in power under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . Joe Clark led the Progressive Conservative Party to power , but with only a minority of seats in the House of Commons . The Liberals , however , did beat the Progressive Conservatives in the overall popular vote by more than 400,000 votes . - William Lyon Mackenzie King (December 17, 1874 July 22, 1950) was the dominant Canadian political leader from the 1920s through the 1940s. He served as the tenth Prime Minister of Canada from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930, and 1935 to 1948. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (19391945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was \\"Help those that cannot help themselves\\"), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state. - The New Democratic Party (NDP NPD) is a social-democratic political party in Canada.

Avenged Sevenfold (sometimes abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman. Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on the band's debut Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and continued this sound through their second album Waking the Fallen. The band's influences include Guns N' Roses, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Pantera, Bad Religion, Dream Theater, Motorhead, Metallica, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, In Flames, At the Gates, Helloween, Queensryche, System of a Down, AC/DC, NOFX, Alice in Chains, Black Flag, Corrosion of Conformity, Suicidal Tendencies, Misfits, Slayer, The Vandals, Soundgarden, Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Slipknot, Deftones, Beastie Boys, Biohazard, Type O Negative, Anthrax and AFI. The band has been categorized under many genres of heavy music. Mainly categorized as heavy metal, hard rock, progressive metal and metalcore, Avenged Sevenfold's music has evolved over most of the band's career. At first, the band's debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet consisted almost entirely of a metalcore sound; however, there were several deviations from this genre, most notably in \\"Streets\\", which shows a punk rock style, and \\"Warmness on the Soul\\", which is a piano ballad. On Waking the Fallen, the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore. In the band's DVD All Excess, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: \\"When I met the band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet had come out before they had recorded Waking the Fallen, M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after that is going to be all singing'.\\" On City of Evil, Avenged Sevenfold's third album, the band chose to abandon the metalcore genre, using a more hard rock and heavy metal style. Avenged Sevenfold's self-titled album, however, has some experiments with other music genres than that from City of Evil, most notably in \\"Dear God\\", which shows a country style and \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\", which is circled within the influence of Broadway show tunes, using primarily brass instruments and stringed orchestra to take over most of the role of the lead and rhythm guitar. Nightmare contains further deviations, including a piano ballad called \\"Fiction\\", progressive metal-oriented track \\"Save Me\\" and a heavy metal sound with extreme vocals and heavier instrumentation on \\"God Hates Us\\". The band's sixth studio album Hail to the King shows more of a classic metal sound and a riff-oriented approach. On their newest album The Stage, the band explores further into progressive metal, blending it with elements of thrash metal. In the past, Avenged Sevenfold has also been described as alternative metal, screamo, and pop punk metal. The band has been criticized for \\"not being metal enough\\". Vocalist M. Shadows responded to this with, \\"we play music for the sake of music, not so that we can be labeled a metal band. That's like telling us we aren't punk enough. Who cares?\\" Avenged Sevenfold is one of the notable acts of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.

Q:This article: On the battlefield, the king's commanders led the troops. The empire's war strategy rarely involved massive invasions; more often it employed small scale methods such as attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire was among the first in India to use long range artillery commonly manned by foreign gunners (those from present day Turkmenistan were considered the best). Army troops were of two types: The king's personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. King Krishnadevaraya's personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by the use of the term Navigadaprabhu (commander of the navy). The army recruited from all classes of society (supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers), and consisted of archers and musketeers wearing quilted tunics, shieldmen with swords and poignards in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so large that no armour was necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.The capital city was completely dependent on the water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians a picture of the prevailing surface water distribution methods in use at that time in the semiarid regions of South India. Contemporary records and notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers. Excavations have uncovered the remains of a well-connected water distribution system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes (suggesting it was for the exclusive use of royalty, and for special ceremonies) with sophisticated channels... contains an answer for the question: Where did the remains of the water supply systems give historians a picture of the prevailing surface water distribution methods?, what is it ?

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the most damaging loss to the British and the standing of their empire? ? Britain's declaration of war against Nazi Germany in September 1939 included the Crown colonies and India but did not automatically commit the Dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland and South Africa. All soon declared war on Germany, but Ireland chose to remain legally neutral throughout the war.After the Fall of France in June 1940, Britain and the empire stood alone against Germany, until the German invasion of Greece on 7 April 1941. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill successfully lobbied President Franklin D. Roosevelt for military aid from the United States, but Roosevelt was not yet ready to ask Congress to commit the country to war. In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the Atlantic Charter, which included the statement that \\"the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live\\" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous as to whether it referred to European countries invaded by Germany and Italy, or the peoples colonised by European nations, and would later be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.In December 1941, Japan launched, in quick succession, attacks on British Malaya, the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, and Hong Kong. Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe, but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. Most damaging of all was the Fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar. The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States. This resulted in the 1951 ANZUS Pact between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America.

Which continent experienced wind phenomena? Two continents were separated by a large ocean. Oceania had milder weather and experienced common weather phenomena, while Lemuria experienced natural disasters. Hint: On Earth, the common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity). Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Oceania experienced wind phenomena."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Hoping to rebound from their last-second home loss to the Panthers, the Chargers flew to Invesco Field at Mile High for a Week 2 AFC West duel with the Denver Broncos. In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as FB Michael Pittman getting a 1-yard TD run, after a Philip Rivers pass to Chris Chambers was ruled an interception on the field. The Chargers challenged the ruling, but the replay system was inoperative to the officials, so the ruling on the field stood. The 'Bolts would respond with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 34-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Denver increased its lead with QB Jay Cutler completing a 3-yard and a 14-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler. San Diego would immediately respond with RB Darren Sproles returning a kickoff 103 yard for a touchdown, yet the Broncos replied with kicker Matt Prater getting a 52-yard field goal. The Chargers would strike at Denver's lead as QB Philip Rivers completing a 48-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers, yet the Broncos would end the half with Cutler completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall. In the third quarter, the 'Bolts began to rally as Rivers completed a 15-yard TD pass to Chambers, along with Kaeding nailing a 21-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, San Diego took the lead with Kaeding's 28-yard field goal and Rivers' 66-yard TD pass to Sproles.

English football star Steven Gerrard has admitted punching a man in a bar, but the Liverpool captain insisted in his court testimony that it was in self-defense. England international Steven Gerrard is in court defending his actions after a bar brawl late last year. The 29-year-old is facing a charge of affray after an incident in the early hours of December 29, when he attacked businessman Marcus McGee following a dispute about the music that was being played. If found guilty, Gerrard faces a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a fine of 7,200. Gerrard, who denies the charge, told a judge on Thursday that he was sorry about his actions in Southport's Lounge Inn, but at the time he thought McGee was going to attack him. They had been involved in an argument after Gerrard tried to change the music on the bar's sound system, but McGee would not let him, the UK Press Association reported. \\"I thought he was going to hit me,\\" Gerrard said. \\"He was on his way forward to me and his behavior had changed from when I was having a discussion with him. I didn't know why.\\" Gerrard said he was unaware that his friend John Doran had already punched McGee when he himself started to hit the 34-year-old. \\"I am certainly mistaken in thinking he was coming towards me to throw punches at me,\\" the midfielder said. \\"Now I know, obviously, he had been struck, reacted and thought the strike was by me and he came into me and that's when I reacted. I am sorry about the whole incident. \\"I grabbed the back of his jumper as he moved forward to me. When I had hold of Marcus, I remember swinging my right hand two or three times. \\"I was trying to stop still and I felt I had arms all over me. I could see a melee around Marcus McGee. When I was getting pulled away I realized people were patting me, some of whom were my friends. \\"I wanted to help control the situation. I was worried the fight I had with Marcus was going to get worse because people were going past me in that direction.\\" Gerrard said that his friends had earlier told him to \\"forget\\" the argument, but he felt he needed to confront McGee. \\"I couldn't understand why the guy had such a problem with me, why he was so aggressive,\\" he said. \\"I was also concerned that if I did leave it I would not have been able to enjoy my night, he may have come over to me. \\"I wanted to see why he had such a problem with it, why a total stranger had such a problem with me putting my favorite songs on. I asked why I couldn't have an input in the music and tried to explain that I had permission from the manageress.\\" \\"I asked Marcus what was the problem with the music machine and why he treated me like that. Very quickly he came off the bar stool and was in my face right by me.\\" Gerrard had been celebrating after scoring two goals as Liverpool thrashed Newcastle 5-1 to remain top of the Premier League, and admitted that he had been drinking alcohol. \\"I certainly knew I had had a drink.

Let shareholders decide One proposal that makes more sense came Monday from Starboard Value, another activist fund that has bought 5.5 percent of Darden and sided with Barington. Starboard has asked shareholders to call a special meeting to have Darden shareholders vote on the merits of a Red Lobster spin. It would take 50 percent support simply to call a special meeting, and even if shareholders vote against the Red Lobster deal, management can technically forge ahead with it. But shareholders should call for a meeting—whether they like the Red Lobster proposal or not. The reason is that if the Red Lobster deal scares off activist investors entirely, management will avoid a serious discussion with shareholders about how to best create value. Left to its own devices, management has a poor track record. Since the start of 2011, Darden shares are up just 9 percent while the S&P 500 has risen nearly 47 percent and Chili's owner Brinker International has gained 152 percent. A big problem has been a slowdown in sales, which put Darden's profit margins under pressure thanks to its inflated cost base. Things don't appear to be getting much better, with analysts expecting same-restaurant sales to decline 1.7 percent at Darden in the year through May. (Read more: Did investors miss the message on BlackBerry?) Shareholders may not love every aspect of the activists' proposals. But the activists are important because they are likely to suggest ideas that management hasn't. And if the activists propose their own board directors at the annual meeting, management will feel pressure to entertain any ideas that appeal to shareholders. First, Darden could probably remove significant costs. In the year through May 2013, Darden spent 205,145 per store in general and administrative expenses. That compares with just 153,407 per store for Brinker in its most recent fiscal year. There's reason to believe Darden's costs could be at least as low as Brinker's given it has a much larger store base, which creates economies of scale. If Darden could reach Brinker's level of so-called G&A per store, it would save 111 million per year, substantial for a company expected to earn 338 million in net income in the year through May. Darden's Red Lobster plan, by comparison, includes just 60 million of annual cost savings by 2015. Also, Darden has made no mention of plans to franchise its store base, which is entirely company-owned. Such deals have been successful for fast-food chains like Jack in the Box that have made such a switch. Analysts expect Jack in the Box to have an operating profit of 180 million in the year through September, up 50 percent from two years earlier. There also are ways for Darden to extract value from its real estate without placing all of it into a REIT. One alternative is to sell select properties and then lease them back. Darden probably has a range of options for creating more shareholder value. But if investors allow the company to keep too much control, they may never get to see the real menu.

As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'.

Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981.

The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that performed on the Sound+Vision Tour? is inside the article: Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust for Life. Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making. The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as \\"a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of Neo-Nazis\\"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, \\"It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book.\\" EMI complained of \\"lyrics that preach\\" as well as \\"repetitive tunes\\" and \\"minimalist or no production\\". The album nevertheless reached No. 3 and went gold in the UK.Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, \\"I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate.\\" They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the..., can you guess it ?

But, really, they were just unable to do what regarding reality and lies? Options: - differentiate - hate - discriminate - contrast - distinguish Explain why a human would choose \\"distinguish\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"distinguish\\" to answer the question above because it appropriately captures the underlying meaning and context of the situation being described. In this case, the man and the woman are comparing their experience to police brutality, which suggests that they have a certain perception or understanding of their situation. However, the question implies that their comparison may not be accurate and that there is a discrepancy between their perception and the actual reality. The word \\"distinguish\\" refers to the ability to recognize or identify differences between two things, in this instance, reality and lies. It implies that the man and the woman are unable to accurately differentiate between what is true and what is false in their situation or that they are having difficulty discerning the reality of their experience. Using the other options provided as answers to the question would not yield the same level of clarity or understanding: 1. \\"Differentiate\\" could potentially work as an answer as well, but \\"distinguish\\" is more fitting when describing someone's ability to perceive differences in qualities or characteristics, in this case, between reality and lies. 2. \\"Hate\\" does not fit the context of the question as it refers to strong negative emotions or feelings of aversion and enmity towards something or someone, rather than recognizing differences or separating reality from lies. 3. \\"Discriminate\\" is more commonly associated with unfairly treating people or things based on unjust criteria, such as race, gender, or social status. It is not directly related to the issue of distinguishing between reality and lies in this context. 4. \\"Contrast\\" is a term that often involves comparing two distinct elements to emphasize their differences, but it does not inherently involve the process of recognizing or discerning those differences from one another in the way that \\"distinguish\\" does. In conclusion, the human would choose \\"distinguish\\" to answer the question because it conveys the most accurate meaning with regard to the inability of the man and woman to separate reality from lies in their situation. The nuance and context provided by the term \\"distinguish\\" make it the most appropriate word among the options provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bill Clinton was in trouble for \\"not having sexual relations with that woman\\" - who was that woman?","completion":"The woman referenced in the quote, \\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman,\\" is Monica Lewinsky. Former President Bill Clinton made this statement during a press conference on January 26, 1998, responding to allegations about his extramarital affair during his presidency. Monica Lewinsky was a 22-year-old unpaid intern in the White House when she and President Clinton began having a series of intimate encounters in 1995, some of which occurred in the Oval Office. The affair lasted until 1997 and was revealed to the public in 1998. Lewinsky, a graduate of Lewis & Clark College, moved to Washington D.C. to take an internship at the White House in July 1995. She was later given a paid position in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. Following rumors of her relationship with Clinton, she was transferred to the Pentagon. This affair came to light when Linda Tripp, a former White House employee, provided taped phone conversations between herself and Lewinsky to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. President Clinton initially denied the affair publicly. He stated, \\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,\\" in a nationally televised White House news conference. However, evidence of the relationship emerged, including a blue dress of Monica's that was stained with Clinton's DNA. Following this revelation, President Clinton testified before a grand jury (via closed-circuit television) in August 1998, becoming the first sitting president to testify before a grand jury investigating his own conduct. During his testimony, he admitted an \\"improper physical relationship\\" with Lewinsky. This led to an impeachment process in December 1998 by the US House of Representatives on the grounds of perjury to a grand jury and obstruction of justice. However, he was acquitted of all impeachment charges by the Senate in February 1999. Monica Lewinsky's life was heavily impacted by the scandal and the public ridicule that followed. She eventually moved to London, where she earned a master's degree in social psychology from the London School of Economics, and has since worked as a social activist championing for a safer and more compassionate social media environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the best way to: How can I keep a bandana in place in my hair?","completion":"Keeping a bandana in place in your hair can be a stylish and practical choice, whether you are trying to manage your hair during a workout, protect it from the sun, or simply create a fun and fashionable look. Here are some steps and tips for ensuring your bandana stays securely in place throughout the day: 1. Choose the right bandana: Select a bandana that is made from a comfortable, durable, and non-slip material, such as cotton. A bandana with some texture or grip can help prevent it from sliding off your hair more easily. The size should be large enough to fold and tie securely around your head. 2. Prepare your hair: The way your hair is styled can impact how securely the bandana stays in place. To provide a more stable base, consider putting your hair up in a ponytail, bun, or braid, depending on your hair length and type. For shorter hairstyles, you can use bobby pins to help secure shorter strands in place. 3. Fold the bandana: Lay the bandana flat on a surface with its pattern or design facing down. Fold it in half diagonally to create a triangle. Depending on the size of the bandana and the look you desire, you can fold it into a thinner or wider strip by either folding the long edge of the triangle over towards the point or by rolling the bandana. 4. Securely tie the bandana: Position the bandana on your head with the folded edge facing outwards to create a smoother look. Make sure the bandana covers your hairline, as this will help keep it in place. Hold the folded edge against your forehead with one hand and use the other hand to wrap the two ends of the bandana around to the back of your head. Cross the two ends, then bring them back to your forehead and tie them in a secure knot. For added stability, consider double-knotting the ends. It's important not to tie the bandana too tightly, as this can result in discomfort or even headaches. 5. Tuck in loose ends: Once you’ve tied the bandana, tuck any loose ends underneath the knot to give a neater appearance. If any part of the bandana feels loose or begins to slip, you can use bobby pins to anchor it to your hair. 6. Apply hairspray (optional): If you find that the bandana still tends to slip, lightly misting your hair with hairspray before placing the bandana on your head can provide additional grip. 7. Adjust throughout the day: Make sure to periodically check your bandana and adjust it as needed throughout the day to prevent slipping and maintain your desired hairstyle. By following these steps and tips, you can successfully keep a bandana in place in your hair, allowing you to enjoy its stylish and practical benefits all day long."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1989, scientist Hank Pym resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering their attempt to replicate his Ant-Man shrinking technology. Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives. In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym. Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter Cassie unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out. Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm while disabling a Soviet nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the Avengers' headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson.

Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning? The Greeks and Romans identified the region in the 3rd century BC as Gangaridai , a historical kingdom of the mighty subcontinent . The Greeks and Romans identified the region in the 3rd century BC as Gangaridai , a mighty kingdom of the historical subcontinent .","completion":"While the two sentences appear to be very similar at first glance, there are subtle differences in their meaning due to the placement of the adjectives \\"mighty\\" and \\"historical.\\" Let's analyze each sentence closely to understand these differences. 1. The Greeks and Romans identified the region in the 3rd century BC as Gangaridai, a historical kingdom of the mighty subcontinent. In this sentence, the phrase \\"historical kingdom\\" emphasizes the age and antiquity of the kingdom of Gangaridai. The adjective \\"mighty\\" modifies the word \\"subcontinent,\\" suggesting that the subcontinent itself is strong and powerful. Thus, this sentence implies that Gangaridai is an ancient kingdom located within a large, powerful, and expansive subcontinent. 2. The Greeks and Romans identified the region in the 3rd century BC as Gangaridai, a mighty kingdom of the historical subcontinent. In this sentence, the adjective \\"mighty\\" modifies the kingdom of Gangaridai rather than the subcontinent. This suggests that Gangaridai itself was a powerful and influential kingdom in its time.

If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too.

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s.

The tone is set almost immediately with Muffy preparing details around the house, and finds an old jack-in-the-box she remembers in a flashback sequence. Meanwhile, her friends are joking around on the pier, then on the ferry to the island. When en route to the island, local deckhand buck Buck is seriously injured in a gruesome accident. Once on the island and in the mansion, it turns out Muffy has set up a variety of little jokes from the simple such as whoopee cushions and dribble glasses, to the more complex and disturbing such as an audiotape of a baby crying in someone's room and heroin paraphernalia in a guest's wardrobe. Through it all, despite the friends in general try to relax, Skip goes missing. Kit catches a glimpse of what looks like his dead body. Soon, Arch and Nan also go missing next. During a search, Nikki falls into the island's well and finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch and the dead body of Nan. Afterward, the remaining group discover that the phones are dead and there is no way to get off the island until Monday.

How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as negative, reflecting the author's current state of dissatisfaction, low mood, and possibly physical discomfort. There are a few clear indicators in the text that suggest a negative sentiment: 1. \\"Heading home early\\" - This phrase implies that the author has decided to leave their current location sooner than planned, suggesting that they are not enjoying themselves or may have some urgent issue that requires their attention at home. It can reveal a sense of urgency and unhappiness with their current situation, which contributes to the overall negative sentiment. 2. \\"I feel like poo\\" - This statement explicitly conveys the author's current emotion and physical state. \\"Feeling like poo\\" is a colloquial and informal way of saying that someone is feeling unwell, physically ill, or simply in a poor emotional state. It is a negative expression that demonstrates the author's desire to convey their discomfort, enhancing the negative sentiment present. 3. Use of casual, informal language - The use of casual language, including colloquialisms and informal phrases like \\"feel like poo,\\" can suggest that the author's emotional or physical state is significant enough to warrant a departure from more formal language. This casual tone can further contribute to the perception of a negative sentiment. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet is predominantly negative. The author is experiencing a degree of physical or emotional discomfort that has led them to leave their current situation early and express their feelings in a candid manner using informal language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Dr William McCrea, 58, even hands out glasses of wine on his ward rounds. He says he has prescribed wine to 10,000 patients over the last 10 years. He came up with the idea after discovering the French have fewer heart attacks than the British despite eating a fattier diet and smoking more. He claims drinking red wine can also reduce the risk of a stroke by 20%. Dr McCrea says screw top bottles of younger wines are most effective. It works because red wine dilates the arteries and raises good cholesterol. Article:","completion":"Title: Doctor Prescribes Red Wine to 10,000 Patients in a Decade for Heart Health Benefits Dr. William McCrea, a 58-year-old medical professional, has been prescribing red wine to his patients for heart health benefits for the past 10 years. Over that time, he claims to have prescribed it to around 10,000 patients, even going as far as handing out glasses of wine during his ward rounds. This unconventional prescription method began after Dr. McCrea discovered that the French population experiences fewer heart attacks than their British counterparts. This is despite the French consuming a fattier diet and smoking more than the average British citizen. Intrigued by this observation, Dr. McCrea looked for possible explanations and found that red wine could be a contributing factor. According to Dr. McCrea, drinking red wine can reduce the risk of a stroke by 20%. This is because the antioxidants present in red wine have the ability to dilate arteries and increase the levels of good cholesterol in the body. These combined effects are believed to contribute to improved heart health and a reduced risk of heart attack. Dr. McCrea recommends screw-top bottles of younger wines, as they are thought to be the most effective for this purpose. He emphasizes the importance of selecting red wines, as they contain a higher concentration of antioxidants than white wines. This component is responsible for the wine's artery-dilating and cholesterol-boosting properties. Although some controversy may arise from Dr. McCrea's unorthodox approach, it is important to consider the potential health benefits of red wine when consumed in moderation. As always, individuals should consult with their healthcare provider before implementing any supplements or dietary changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: - oxygen intake - new lungs - think more clearly - feeling refreshed - silence Explain why a human would choose \\"think more clearly\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"think more clearly\\" as the answer to the question above because breathing fresh air can positively impact our mental state and cognitive abilities, ultimately helping us make better decisions. When we breathe fresh air, we take in more oxygen, which is needed for our brains to function optimally. Oxygen is essential for the production of energy in the brain, and inadequate oxygen levels can lead to reduced mental sharpness, fatigue, and even depression. As a result, increased oxygen intake due to fresh air directly contributes to clearer thinking and improved decision-making. Moreover, when we step outside and take a break from our current surroundings, we often feel more refreshed and alert. This can help to reset our minds, enabling us to think more clearly and make better decisions. Feeling refreshed can also reduce stress levels, which may further contribute to improved cognitive function. While options like \\"oxygen intake\\" and \\"feeling refreshed\\" are also correct elements for the importance of breathing fresh air, the option \\"think more clearly\\" integrates both of these aspects and emphasizes the core benefit of clearer thinking for decision-making. The options \\"new lungs\\" and \\"silence\\" are not directly related to the question as they do not link to the cognitive benefits that fresh air can provide to make better decisions. In summary, a human would choose \\"think more clearly\\" to answer the question above because breathing fresh air enhances oxygen intake and provides a refreshing break, both of which contribute to clearer thinking and improved decision-making."},{"prompt":"Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The body does not exist in isolation.

Charles Parker Jr. (August 29, 1920 - March 12, 1955), also known as Yardbird and Bird, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and advanced harmonies. Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso, and he introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Parker died on March 12, 1955, in the suite of his friend and patroness Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter at the Stanhope Hotel in New York City, while watching The Dorsey Brothers' Stage Show on television. The official causes of death were lobar pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer, but Parker also had an advanced case of cirrhosis and had suffered a heart attack. The coroner who performed his autopsy mistakenly estimated Parker's 34-year-old body to be between 50 and 60 years of age. Since 1950, Parker had been living with Chan Berg, the mother of his son Baird (who lived until 2014) and his daughter Pree (who died as an infant of cystic fibrosis). He considered Chan his wife although he never married her, nor did he divorce his previous wife, Doris, whom he had married in 1948. His marital status complicated the settling of Parker's estate and would ultimately serve to frustrate his wish to be quietly interred in New York City. Dizzy Gillespie paid for the funeral arrangements and organized a lying-in-state, a Harlem procession officiated by Congressman and Reverend Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., as well as a memorial concert. Parker's body was flown back to Missouri, in accordance with his mother's wishes. Berg criticized Doris and Parker's family for giving him a Christian funeral, even though they knew he was a confirmed atheist. Parker was buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Missouri, in a hamlet known as Blue Summit, located close to I-435 and East Truman Road. Parker's estate is managed by Jampol Artist Management.","completion":"This text is about Charles Parker Jr., also known as Yardbird and Bird, an American jazz saxophonist and composer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: \\"What facet of evolution by natural selection did Darwin focus on in his work that was presented to the Linnean Society?\\" Context: \\"Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In his work presented to the Linnean Society, Charles Darwin focused on the aspect of evolution by natural selection that involved competition between individuals and the mechanism being analogous to artificial selection practiced by animal breeders. Darwin's approach emphasized the struggle for existence among individuals within a species, resulting in the survival and reproduction of those with favorable traits. In contrast, Alfred Russel Wallace, who independently conceived a similar evolutionary mechanism, focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Unlike Darwin, Wallace did not draw a comparison to selective breeding and his ideas have been interpreted by some historians as potentially involving group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation. The joint publication of the papers by Wallace and Darwin at the Linnean Society in 1858 presented both mechanisms of evolution by natural selection, highlighting the significance of Darwin's focus on competition between individuals and its analogy to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'll give it three stars because there are a few areas where the app could use some improvements. One thing I like about the app is its user interface, which is fairly easy to navigate. However, I often find that the app crashes or freezes unexpectedly, especially when downloading larger files. This can be quite frustrating, as I have to restart the app to continue using it. Another issue I've experienced is the large number of ads. While I understand that the app needs financial support, the amount of ads can be excessive and sometimes interfere with the app's functionality. A feature that could benefit from improvement is the app's search function. It often takes multiple searches to find the desired content, and the search results don't always seem relevant. Improving the search algorithm could significantly improve the user experience. Overall, com.frostwire.android is a functional app that gets the job done, but it could use some work to iron out the issues mentioned.

So was a girl in my class named Lisa. That's where the similarities ended. I was tall and she was small. My thick black hair had been recently cut short into an untidy style. Her natural blonde hair flowed to her waist and looked great. I was 12 and one of the oldest in the class while she was 11 and the youngest. I was awkward and shy. She wasn't. I couldn't stand her, considering her my enemy. But she liked me and wanted to be friends. One day, she invited me over and I said yes--I was too shocked to answer any other way. My family had moved six times in six years, and I had never managed to develop any friendships. But this girl who wore the latest fashions wanted me to go home with her after school. She lived in a fun part of town that had two pizza places, an all-night bookstore, a movie theater and a park. As we walked from the school bus stop through her neighborhood, I tried to guess which house might be hers. Was it the white one with the perfect lawn or the three-story house with a front porch? I got very surprised when she led me into an old apartment building. She lived on the fourth floor in a two-room place with her mother,her stepfather, her two brothers and her sister. When we got into the room she shared with her sister, she took out a big case of Babies, which was my next surprise. I had never played with them. We sat on the floor,laughing as we made up crazy stories about the Babies. We found out that we both wanted to be writers when we were older and both had wild imaginations. We had a great day that afternoon. Lisa was loved by the whole neighborhood. The bookstore owners lent her fashion magazines; the movie theater gave her free tickets... Soon I was included in her magic world. We slept over at each other's houses and spent every free moment together.

It is a surface that looks like grass but is actually made of synthetic materials. It is sometimes used on soccer fields and playgrounds because it is easy to take care of and safer for players. Some people are not very happy with this decision because, next year, the Women's World Cup in Canada will be played on this artificial turf instead of real grass.

By then the language had developed a literary tradition, and since then it has changed little; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard Czech, and contemporary Czechs can understand them with little difficulty. Changes include the morphological shift of í to ej and é to í (although é survives for some uses) and the merging of í and the former ejí. Sometime before the eighteenth century, the Czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic /l/ and /ʎ/ which survives in Slovak. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How much difficulty do contemporary Czechs have in understanding material from the 18th century?","completion":"Contemporary Czechs generally have little difficulty in understanding material from the 18th century. This is due to the fact that standard Czech originated during that period, and there have been minimal changes in the language since then. Some journals and literary texts from that era are quite similar to modern standard Czech, which allows Czech speakers today to comprehend the material without much trouble. Although there are a few changes that have occurred since the 18th century, such as the morphological shift of í to ej and é to í, as well as the merging of í and the former ejí, these modifications do not impede the overall understanding of the language. Moreover, the distinctions between phonemic /l/ and /ʎ/, which were lost in Czech but preserved in Slovak, do not pose any significant difficulty for modern Czech speakers. In summary, contemporary Czechs can understand 18th-century material relatively easily, as there have been minimal changes to the Czech language since its development as a standard form during that period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sweet little Jane searched and searched, crawling under her cozy bed, peering into her dollhouse, and even rummaging through her overflowing toy box. She asked Mr. Teddy, her forever best friend, \\"Have you seen my hairbrush, Mr. Teddy?\\" Mr. Teddy couldn't answer, though, because he was just a stuffed bear, but he gave her a warm, comforting hug. Feeling a little tired from all the searching, Jane decided to ask her mommy for help. Mommy entered Jane's room with a gentle smile and said, \\"Let's clean up this room, and maybe we'll find your hairbrush.\\" Together, they began tidying up the room, putting toys back into their places, and folding the scattered clothes.

Summarize: Interval training involves alternating between short high-intensity and long low-intensity activities to make your workouts more effective. When you develop your workout routine, look for activities that push your limits and are difficult to complete and plan to do them in 30-second bursts. Then choose less strenuous activities and complete them for 3-4 minutes at a time. For example, you may incorporate 30 seconds of jogging or sprinting followed by 3-4 minutes of brisk walking. Continue alternating between them until you finish your workout. Aim to exercise at least 4-5 days each week with interval training. Interval training also allows you to burn more calories than a regular workout. Doing frequent cardio workouts prevents you from getting winded during a fight and boosts how long you last against your opponent. Incorporate exercises such as running, swimming, or cycling into your weekly routine so you can stay fit. Start with a 10-minute warmup so you can prepare for the rest of your workout before switching to higher-intensity exercise to keep your heart rate in your target range. Aim to do cardio for 45-60 minutes at least 2-3 times per week. If you’re at a gym or have the equipment, you can also include using a treadmill, elliptical, rowing machine, or stepping machine for your cardio workout. Strengthening your arms allows you to throw more powerful punches and block hits better. Keep your arms straight down at your sides and hold dumbbells in each hand. Make sure the weight of the dumbbells is easy for you to lift repeatedly without getting tired. Bend your arms at the elbow to curl the weights up to your shoulders in controlled motions. Slowly lower your arms back down to your sides to complete the rep. Aim to do 3 sets of 15-20 reps for your workout. Stand up straight with your arms at your side and take a large step forward with one foot. As you step forward, bend your knees until your front leg forms a 90-degree angle. Pause for 1 count before standing upright again. Alternate which leg you use after each lunge to get a balanced workout. Do 2-3 sets of 10-15 lunges. You can choose to do lunges with your bodyweight or you can hold dumbbells to make them more difficult. Lay in a plank position on the floor and plant your palms are slightly wider than your shoulders. Straighten your arms to raise yourself off the ground so your back stays straight. Lower yourself slowly toward the ground until your elbows form a 90-degree angle and hold the position for 1 count. Straighten your arms again to raise your body in a slow, controlled motion. Aim to do 2-3 sets of 15-20 push-ups for your workout. If standard push-ups are too hard, put your knees on the ground to make them easier. If you want to make your push-ups more difficult, move your body in a circular motion as you lower yourself to the ground to activate your core even more. Stand so your back is straight and your feet are slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees until they form a 90-degree angle to lower your body closer to the ground while you keep your back straight. Hold the position for 1 count before straightening your legs to jump off the ground. As soon as you land, start going into your next squat. Do 2-3 sets of 15-20 jump squats to get a good leg workout. Building up your leg strength allows you to move more quickly and throw more powerful kicks. Squat using 1 leg at a time if you want to make them more difficult. You can choose to do bodyweight squats or hold dumbbells if you want to increase the weight. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms at your side. Keep your back straight as you bend your knees until they’re at a 90-degree angle. Plant your palms on the ground in front of you and move your feet behind you to get into a plank position. Lower your body until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle before jumping back up into a squat. Jump in the air to straighten your legs and start your next squat immediately when you land. Aim to do 2-3 sets of 10-15 burpees. Hold your body up on parallel bars so your arms are fully extended and your feet are off the ground. Bend your elbows until they’re at a 90-degree angle to lower your body and activate your chest, back, and tricep muscles. Hold the pose for 1 count before lifting yourself back up again. Try doing 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps when you do dips. Wear a weighted belt or ankle weights if you want to make the exercise more difficult. If you don’t have access to parallel bars, you can also do dips using a bench instead.","completion":"Interval training alternates between high-intensity and low-intensity activities for effective workouts.

Answer:","completion":"Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar is known as the \\"Father of the Indian Constitution.\\" He was a renowned Indian jurist, economist, politician, and social reformer who played a vital role in the formation of the Indian Constitution. Born on April 14th, 1891, in the town of Mhow in Madhya Pradesh, India, to parents of the Mahar caste, which was considered \\"untouchable\\" within the hierarchical caste system, Ambedkar had personal experiences with social inequality and discrimination. These experiences fuelled his determination to combat social oppression and fight for equal rights for every section of society, making him a key figure in modern India's socal and political history. Educated at the University of Bombay, Columbia University in the United States, and the London School of Economics, Dr. Ambedkar held doctorates in economics from both Columbia University and the University of London, offering him a deep understanding of the constitution-making processes of many successful nations. After India gained its independence from British colonial rule on August 15, 1947, the need for a comprehensive governing legal document became apparent. A Constituent Assembly was formed for this purpose, and they appointed Ambedkar as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee on August 29, 1947. As the head of the Drafting Committee, Dr. Ambedkar was entrusted with the task of drafting the Constitution of India. His wide-ranging knowledge and experience were instrumental in structuring the Indian constitution. He carefully studied constitutions from around the world to ensure that India's Constitution would include the best aspects of all. Under Dr. Ambedkar’s leadership, the committee worked for 2 years, 11 months, and 18 days before the Constitution was finally adopted by the Indian Republic. The Constitution of India was adopted on November 26, 1949, and came into effect on January 26, 1950, declaring India a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. Dr. Ambedkar's contributions to the Constitution include provisions for social reform, promoting equality and discouraging discrimination of any sort, and he was especially determined to improve the conditions for India's \\"Untouchable\\" community. He was the driving force behind certain crucial articles related to social justice, like the abolition of untouchability (Article 17), the prohibition of discrimination (Article 15), and providing reservations for socially and educationally backward classes (Article 16(4)). Dr. Ambedkar, throughout his career, aggressively campaigned against social discrimination towards untouchables, women, and labour. He also played a significant role in the implementation of the Indian economy's state-controlled aspects as envisaged by the constitution. For his invaluable contributions to the creation and shaping of the Constitution of India, Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar is deservedly hailed as the Constitution's \\"father.\\" His life and works remain an inspirational touchstone for generations of Indians fighting against social injustice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: PART I: By what means Redmond Barry acquired the style and title of Barry Lyndon.In the opening scene, set in 1750s Ireland, the father of Irishman Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is killed in a duel by a businessman over a disputed sale of some horses. This detail is related by the film's narrator (the voice of Michael Hordern), who comments ironically on the events that transpire. The widow (Marie Kean), disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to the raising of her son.While still in his teens, Barry falls in love with his older cousin, Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). A wealthy English army officer named Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) meets and begins courting Nora, leading the jealous Barry to challenge Quin to a duel. They fire pistols at ten paces and Quin falls. Believing that he has killed Quin and will be arrested by the British for murder, Barry flees.On the road to Dublin, Barry is robbed and his horse stolen by a middle-aged highwayman (Arthur O'Sullivan) and the man's son. Penniless, Barry enlists in the British army and finds himself in boot camp. During training, Barry gets into a brawl with a local bully named O'Toole (Pat Roach), and is forced to fight bare-knuckle against the guy. Barry wins the fight by dodging all of O'Toole's blows and knocks out his opponent, which earns him popularity from the rest of his fellow recruits.After basic training, Barry and his unit are sent to France to fight in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) between the alliance of Great Britain and Prussia and the alliance of France, Austria and Russia. While still in a training camp, Barry learns from an old friend, Captain Grogan (Godfrey Quigley), that Captain Quin is not dead after all and has married Nora. The whole duel was a ploy by Nora's relatives to make Barry flee from Ireland so she can marry Quin.After the death of Grogan in a skirmish, Barry, fed up with the brutality of war, deserts from the British army. Posing as a British officer, Barry travels through the allied German states along the Rhine,...

Help as much as you can. Nate and Andy were two zoologists. They have been studying the characteristics of nocturnal and diurnal animals. Andy studied nocturnal animals, while Nate studied diurnal animals. Which zoologist learned less about animals that are sleeping during the day? Hint: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.

After their con is discovered, the two evade capture and hide aboard one of the ships to be led by HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s to the New World. During the trip, they are caught as stowaways and imprisoned, but manage to break free and take a rowboat with the help of CortÃ©s' horse, Altivo. Later, they land on an unknown shore at the edge of Mexico, and Miguel begins to recognize landmarks from the map, leading them to a totem marker near a large waterfall. Believing it to be a dead end, they suddenly encounter a native woman being chased by guards; when the guards see Tulio and Miguel riding Altivo as depicted on the totem, they escort them to a secret entrance behind the falls, along with the woman, and into a city truly made of gold, El Dorado. They are brought to the city's elders, kind-hearted Chief Tannabok and wicked high priest Tzekel-Kan. Tzekel-Kan, seeking to seize the city from Tannabok, insists that the two, mistaken as gods, demonstrate their powers. Tulio and Miguel bicker between themselves, while a nearby volcano begins to erupt. When Tulio yells at Miguel to stop pestering him, the volcano suddenly stops erupting, and the citizens take this as proof of their godhood. Celebrations are held, and the pair are given luxurious quarters to stay, along with charge of the woman, Chel. Chel is aware the two are conning the people but promises to remain quiet if they take her with them when they leave the city. The two are showered with gifts of gold from Tannabok, but disapproves Tzekel-Kan in sacrificing a civilian as the gods' ritual. Tulio convinces Tannabok to build them a vessel that will allow them to leave the city with all the gifts they've been given, which will take three days.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","completion":"The given data, \\"3 COUNTIES_REPRESENTED Suffolk,\\" provides information about geographical representation in a specific context, likely related to a political, demographic, or statistical analysis of a region. In this case, the data indicates that there are three distinct entities (possibly governmental or administrative) that represent the county of Suffolk. This detailed description will break down the various aspects the data can shed light on. 1. Geographical Context: Suffolk is a county situated in the East of England, United Kingdom. It encompasses a predominantly rural area with several charming and historic towns, such as Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds, and Newmarket. It is bordered by the North Sea to the east and adjacent counties, such as Norfolk to the north, Cambridgeshire to the west, and Essex to the south. 2. Representation: The data suggests that there are three organizations, governments, or administrative entities that represent the interests and concerns of the people living within the county. These representatives might be grouped based on geographic districts, population density, or political divisions. Such representation aims to address the social, economic, and political needs of Suffolk's residents and promote their overall well-being. 3. Types of Representation: As the data does not provide specific information about these representing entities, they can range from various tiers of government (local councils, parliamentary constituencies) to non-governmental groups. Some possibilities include: a. Local Councils: There may be three primary local councils, which are responsible for providing essential services, such as waste management, housing, and public health. These councils also participate in policy planning, zoning regulations, and infrastructural improvement for their respective regions within Suffolk. b. Parliamentary Constituencies: Suffolk might be divided into three electoral sections, which determine the allocation of representatives in the national or regional legislative assemblies. In the case of the United Kingdom, these representatives would be Members of Parliament (MPs) who serve in the House of Commons. c. Non-governmental Groups: Various non-profit organizations or community-based initiatives that focus on representing the interests of the Suffolk communities in matters related to environmental policy, education, or specific industries (e.g., agriculture, tourism) can be represented in this data too. In conclusion, the data \\"3 COUNTIES_REPRESENTED Suffolk\\" provides a snapshot of the geographical representation within the county of Suffolk. While the specific entities and the nature of their representation are not explicitly mentioned, this information points to a political or administrative structure wherein three distinct groups serve the needs and interests of the people living in this region.

Step 2: Consider alternative disposal methods Since the bags were too small, the gardener thought about alternative ways to get rid of the excess vines. They considered composting the vines, repurposing them for a different gardening task, or finding a larger, more suitable bag. Step 3: Evaluate potential solutions The gardener weighed the pros and cons of each alternative solution. Composting would be an environmentally friendly way to dispose of the vines, while repurposing them for a different task could save time and money. Finding a larger bag was also an option but might require additional effort and resources. Step 4: Choose the best solution In the end, the gardener decided that composting was the most efficient and sustainable solution. They would create a compost pile with the excess vines, adding nutrients back into the soil and avoiding waste. Step 5: Implement the solution The gardener started a compost pile in a suitable location, properly layering the excess vines with other organic materials to create an optimal environment for decomposition.

The main theaters of conflict during the Persian Wars were in Asia Minor, Thrace, the Aegean Sea, and the Greek mainland, including major battles at Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis, and Plataea. Your answer, \\"However, the League's involvement in an Egyptian revolt (from 460–454 BC) resulted in a disastrous defeat, and further campaigning was suspended,\\" refers to a later point in time and a different war.

Photo: FORVM MMX One of the world's earliest representations of Christ has been unearthed in southern Spain by a team of archaeologists, a glass plate which shines new light on the arrival of Christianity in Spain. The green glass paten, the plate which holds the Holy Eucharist in churches, is the earliest depiction of Jesus found in Spain and is in excellent condition compared to similar pieces discovered around Europe. “We know it dates back to the 4th century, in part because popes in the following centuries ordered all patens to be made out of silver,” Marcelo Castro, head of the Forum MMX excavation project, told The Local. The team of archaeologists have so far managed to find 81 percent of the paten at the site of a religious building in Cástulo, an ancient Iberian town in the province of Jaén, Andalusia. Measuring 22 centimetres in diameter, it shows three beardless men with short hair and halos over their heads. According to Castro, the figures are Jesus and the apostles Paul and Peter as depicted in Christ in Majesty, an early Christian art form which copied Roman and Byzantine styles. The Forum MMX team have been able to establish the paten was made in the 300s thanks to coins and ceramic objects found at the same site. “We were wary about presenting the paten as a 4th century piece in case it clashed with previous studies into the chronology of Christianity in Spain,” Castro explained. But their estimates coincide with the rule of Constantine, the first Roman emperor to claim conversion to Christianity, who also ensured the religion's clandestine followers were no longer persecuted. The paten was put on display on Wedneday at the Archaeological Museum of Linares (Jaén), alongside other ancient pieces such as a mosaic of Cupid (Mosaico de los Amores), unearthed in 2012 and named as one of the discoveries of the year by National Geographic. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

It is engraved on a glass plate dating back to the 4th Century AD, reports from Spain say. The plate is believed to have been used to hold Eucharistic bread as it was consecrated in early Christian rituals. It measures 22cm in diameter and fragments of it were unearthed outside the southern Spanish city of Linares, ABC newspaper reports. Scientists working for the FORVM MMX project found it inside a building used for religious worship in what remains of the ancient town of Castulo. The find made scientists \\"review the chronology of early Christianity in Spain\\", FORVM MMX project director Marcelo Castro told El Mundo newspaper. The pieces were in an excellent state of preservation - 81% of its original area has now been pieced together by scientists.
