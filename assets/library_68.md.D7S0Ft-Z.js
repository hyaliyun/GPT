Step 3: Gather necessary materials Before I start, I would gather a new light bulb, making sure it's the correct type and wattage for the lamp. Depending on the lamp, some may require different light bulb bases such as screw or bayonet. Step 4: Allow the light bulb to cool down If the lamp was turned on recently, I would wait for a few minutes for the burnt-out bulb to cool down before attempting to remove it. Step 5: Removing the old light bulb Depending on the lampshade and its fitting, I would either remove or lift the lampshade to access the lightbulb easily. Then, I would gently grip the burnt-out bulb and twist it counterclockwise (for a screw base) or push and twist counterclockwise (for a bayonet base) until it's released from the socket. Step 6: Installing the new light bulb I would carefully take the new light bulb and insert it into the socket, making sure not to touch the glass part as the oils from the skin can weaken the bulb and decrease its lifespan. I would twist it clockwise (for a screw base) or aligning the base's pins with the slots and twisting it clockwise (for a bayonet base) until it's firmly in place. Step 7: Re-assemble the lampshade Once the new light bulb is installed, I would re-assemble the lampshade back to its original position. Step 8: Test the new light bulb I would plug the lamp back into the electrical outlet and turn it on to ensure that the new light bulb is functioning correctly.

Write a title for this article: RICHMOND – With a full offseason program and nearly two weeks of training camp in the books, Redskins General Manager Bruce Allen sees his players buying into new Coach Jay Gruden’s way of doing things and expressed encouragement over the direction they are headed. GM Bruce Allen, right, and owner Daniel Snyder have seen plenty they like so far in Richmond. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) “This is his program,” Allen said following Saturday’s practice. “The players have really accepted his philosophy to practice, and I think that’s why we’ve gotten so much good work in so far.” Saturday marked the 10th day of camp, and the ninth practice session since the team reported for duty on July 23. Washington has three days of practice coming up, and then will play its first preseason game Thursday at home against New England. Giving his assessment of how camp has gone so far, Allen said, “Very smooth. But a couple of injuries. Keeping the guys healthy is priority No. 1, and learning, too. So we’re doing well on the learning. We’ve lost a couple guys already.” Players have noted a more spirited and competitive tone to the practices under Gruden, who replaced Mike Shanahan as coach in January. As he tries to rebuild a franchise that went 3-13 last season, Gruden during camp has emphasized strong fundamentals, discipline and high intensity. Players have embraced Gruden’s philosophies and the new energy he brings. “It’s just a different style,” Allen said. “Each coach and each team takes on the personality of its coach, and Jay has been very involved with the guys and his evening meetings really set the tone for the next day’s work.” Asked to describe the tone of those evening meetings, Allen said, “Enthusiastic.” One of Gruden’s chief tasks involves helping quarterback Robert Griffin III rebound from a trying 2013 campaign and also developing him into a more well-rounded quarterback. Allen declined to list what areas of growth he has seen in Griffin since he started working with Allen, but he does see improvements in the quarterback, and the team as a whole. “I think it’s early,” he said. “[Griffin] is learning a new offense and that will take some time, but he’s working hard, and we’re getting better.” Have a Redskins question?

Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus. It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record.

The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \\"Lie!\\".

The Ottomans were amassing an army at Thebes, and their 2,000-strong cavalry effectively controlled Attica, limiting the Venetians to the environs of Athens, so that the Venetians had to establish forts to secure the road linking Athens to Piraeus. On 26 December, the 1,400-strong remnant of the Hannoverian contingent departed, and a new outbreak of the plague during the winter further weakened the Venetian forces. The Venetians managed to recruit 500 Arvanites from the rural population of Attica as soldiers, but no Greeks were willing to join the Venetian army. In a council on 31 December, it was decided to abandon Athens and focus on other projects, such as the conquest of Negroponte. A camp was fortified at the Munychia to cover the evacuation, and it was suggested, but not agreed on, that the walls of the Acropolis should be razed. As the Venetian preparations to leave became evident, many Athenians chose to leave, fearing Ottoman reprisals: 622 families, some 4,000-5,000 people, were evacuated by Venetian ships and settled as colonists in Argolis, Corinthia, Patras, and Aegean islands. Morosini decided to at least take back a few ancient monuments as spoils, but on 19 March the statues of Poseidon and the chariot of Nike fell down and smashed into pieces as they were being removed from the western pediment of the Parthenon. The Venetians abandoned the attempt to remove further sculptures from the temple, and instead took a few marble lions, including the famous Piraeus Lion, which had given the harbour its medieval name \\"Porto Leone\\", and which today stands at the entrance of the Venetian Arsenal. On 10 April, the Venetians evacuated Attica for the Peloponnese.","completion":"Considering the various factors that led to the weakening of Morosini's position in Athens, as well as the ultimate decision to abandon the city, how did the Venetian forces' recruitment challenges, particularly among the Greek population, impact their overall campaign strategy and contribute to their focus on preserving cultural monuments rather than attaining military strength during their occupation of Athens?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The French side led on two minutes when City's Carli Lloyd handled in the box and Saki Kumagai converted the penalty. Kosovare Asllani quickly slotted in the hosts' equaliser but Dzsenifer Marozsan soon put Lyon deservedly back in front. France striker Eugenie Le Sommer added a third after the break to put Lyon in command for the second leg on 29 April. Champions League debutants City, bidding to be the first English women's team to reach a European final since 2007, almost pulled one back late on but Abbie McManus' effort was palmed onto the woodwork. The French league champions, who have featured in five of the past seven Champions League finals - winning three - could have won in Manchester by a bigger margin. Both sides went into the game having kept 13 clean sheets in their past 16 games, yet the match started at a frantic pace, with three goals in the opening 16 minutes. Lyon had an effort from France captain Wendie Renard cleared off the line even before Japan's Kumagai calmly tucked in from the spot after World Player of the Year Lloyd's handball. Toni Duggan's fine through ball allowed Sweden's Asllani to level but the visitors were a constant threat and Marozsan quickly drilled in for 2-1 and substitute Le Sommer added further damage from a tight angle in the second half. Women's FA Cup finalists City - Britain's first Women's Champions League semi-finalists since Birmingham City in 2013-14 - won the English title and League Cup in 2016 and could still theoretically win five trophies in the space of nine months. But Lyon will now reach 1 June's final in Cardiff if they avoid conceding three goals or more in the return leg in France next Saturday.

This individual clearly displayed a penchant for dominating the conversation and basking in the attention that his self-proclaimed depravity granted him. This conversational imbalance may have left you feeling unheard and irritated by his self-absorption, thus causing your annoyance with him. It is not uncommon for people to feel irked when they are in the company of someone who is more interested in expressing their opinions than genuinely engaging in a balanced, reciprocal conversation. A healthy interaction typically involves both parties listening and learning from each other, creating a feeling of connection and understanding. When one person seeks to monopolize the conversation and turns it into a monologue, it can breed frustration and alienation for the other individual involved. Moreover, his constant attempts to prove his depravity might have been off-putting and given you the impression that he was seeking validation or attention rather than having a genuine exchange of ideas. This kind of behavior can be tiresome, especially if it persists throughout the conversation without any semblance of authenticity or vulnerability. In conclusion, the most plausible reason for your annoyance with this person is that he liked hearing himself talk, leaving little room for a genuine conversation and connection between the two of you.

First question: An introvert is like someone who gets tired when they're around a lot of people and needs a little time to recharge, while an extrovert is like someone who gets energy from being around people. It's like having a toy that needs quiet time to recharge its batteries and another toy that charges from playing with others. It's not possible to be both at the exact same time, but some people can have parts of both. That's called being an ambivert, like a mix of the two toys. Second question: This question is actually asking the same thing as the first question. 'Extravert' is just another way to spell 'extrovert'. Both words mean the same thing, like when two friends have different nicknames but are the same person.

Q:It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy. What does Donald Trump feel regarding the Stormy Daniels drama? A. not enough information B. Excitement C. Happiness D. Frustration A:","completion":"Donald Trump likely feels frustration regarding the Stormy Daniels drama. This situation serves as an unwelcome distraction from his administration's policy initiatives and achievements. The Stormy Daniels story involves personal allegations against Trump, which might damage his reputation and support, despite his denial of the claims.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: - A stream or river must occur - Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock - Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through - After many years the river may dry up The answer is:","completion":"The final step of the given process, which describes the formation of a landscape feature through the action of a stream or river and subsequent erosion, can be summarized as follows: - The formation of a canyon, gorge, or valley as the lasting geological impact of the stream or river. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's first recap the process described in the given question: 1. A stream or river occurs, typically as a result of precipitation, snowmelt, or groundwater seeping to the surface. This formation of waterways is typically influenced by factors such as topography, geology, climate, and the presence of vegetation. 2. Through the process of erosion, the stream or river cuts into the soil and bedrock. Erosion is the gradual wearing away of rock, soil, and other materials by various agents, such as water, wind, or ice. In this case, the moving water in the stream or river erodes the surrounding material over time. 3. With the continuous action of erosion, a deep gash is cut through the landscape. This process often progresses faster in areas where the bedrock is relatively soft or has natural fractures, making it more susceptible to erosion. 4. After many years, it is possible that the river may dry up due to various factors, such as a change in local climate, reduced precipitation, or human intervention (e.g., damming, water diversion). However, even after the river ceases to flow, the landscape feature remains. The final step of the process, therefore, is the formation of a canyon, gorge, or valley as the lasting geological impact of the stream or river. These formations are characterized by steep-sided slopes, with varying depths and widths, and can be found on every continent. These landscape features can continue to evolve long after the stream or river has dried up, with factors such as weathering and slope failures contributing to their ongoing development. Additionally, the canyons, gorges, and valleys that form as a result of these processes can have a significant impact on local ecosystems, providing unique habitats for plant and animal life, as well as acting as natural barriers between different regions. In conclusion, the final step in the process described by the given question is the formation of a canyon, gorge, or valley as the lasting geological impact of the stream or river. These landscape features arise through the continuous action of erosion and remain as striking examples of the power of water in shaping the Earth's surface, even after the river or stream has dried up."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[Image credit: US Customs and Border Protection] While privacy advocates are concerned that the technology could be used to track people and could put law-abiding citizens and visitors it can't recognize in trouble, CBP believes it will significantly bolster airport security and also speed up processing time for travelers. According to The Star, it already reduced international travelers' wait times by four minutes at the Mineta San Jose International Airport. Dulles first tested the use of facial recognition as a security measure back in 2015, but it has only just implemented the fledgling technology on August 20th. It's one of the first 14 airports to launch biometric entry and exit using facial comparison, and the data it collects will help CBP determine how to use the technology. The agency is hoping to be able to completely replace boarding passes and IDs with a new security process that only uses facial recognition in the future. Casey Durst, CBP's director, said in a statement: ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Tom Costello and Ethan Sacks WASHINGTON — Facial recognition technology caught an impostor trying to enter the U.S. on a fake passport that may have passed at face value with humans, federal officials said Thursday. And the groundbreaking arrest came on just the third day the biometric technology has been used at Washington Dulles International Airport. The 26-year-old man arrived Wednesday on a flight from Sao Paulo, Brazil, and presented a French passport to the customs officer, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Using the new facial comparison biometric system, the officer determined the unidentified traveler did not match the passport he presented. After being sent for a secondary examination, an identification card from the Republic of Congo was found hidden at the bottom of the man's shoe, officials said. \\"So he was trying to enter the country illegally, we apprehended him, processed him and returned him back to Brazil,\\" CBP Area Port Director Daniel Mattina told NBC News at the airport. A search revealed the man's Republic of Congo identification card concealed in his shoe. The photo on the card has been altered to conceal the man's identity by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Wednesday's arrest was the first identity scammer detected using the new technology, U.S. officials said. The fledgling technology is already being tested at 14 airports, including Dulles starting on Monday. \\"You can much more accurately identify who an individual is. You can much more rapidly speed them through processes,\\" David Heyman, a former assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration, told NBC News. \\"And be much more likely be able to target the individuals who are unlawfully present in the United States.\\" Facial recognition uses algorithms to match physical characteristics against photos and videos of people's faces that are on file from visas, passports and other sources. Customs officials say the cameras have a 99 percent accuracy rate. But critics worry about the implications for invasions of privacy that come with widespread use of the technology and the potential for mistaken matches. Proponents of facial recognition in airports believe the biometric technology could be used as both a security enhancement and to speed up end-to-end processing starting at check-in. The Transportation Security Administration has said it may eventually replace boarding passes, and the agency is testing the technology at a checkpoint at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Tom Costello reported from Washington, D.C., and Ethan Sacks from New York City. ||||| Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents used new facial recognition technology to arrest a man trying to enter the U.S. illegally, the agency said Thursday.

Customs and Border Protection The new facial recognition system compares photos in passports to the faces of the people presenting them, and flagged that the man didn't match the passport photo. He was taken in for questioning, and during a search, officials say they found the man's actual ID from the Republic of Congo hidden in his shoe. The agency said it was the first time a passenger with fake travel documents was discovered using the technology. CBP did not reveal the man's name, citing a pending investigation. He faces possible criminal prosecution. \\"Facial recognition technology is an important step forward for CBP in protecting the United States from all types of threats,\\" said Casey Durst, director of the CBP's Baltimore Field Office. \\"Terrorists and criminals continually look for creative methods to enter the U.S. including using stolen genuine documents. The new facial recognition technology virtually eliminates the ability for someone to use a genuine document that was issued to someone else.\\" CBP said it's assessing the use of the technology as part of a future process in which travelers use biometrics instead of their boarding pass or physical ID to pass through security screening. In 2015, CBS News was given access to a demonstration of the facial recognition technology at Dulles during a pilot program. It officially started at Dulles on Monday. In June, Orlando International Airport became the first in the country to implement the program. According to CBP, there are now 14 airports using it.

The infiltration of a Middle Eastern terror network by a mole who helped foil a plot to blow up a U.S.-bound plane was a \\"phenomenal,\\" \\"brilliant\\" and \\"powerful\\" success, experts said Wednesday. It's unclear how much of the credit should go to the United States or to Saudi Arabia, for whom sources say the mole was working, but both countries have delivered a practical and psychological setback to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, analysts on the region said. Western officials describe that affiliate as al Qaeda's most dangerous. \\"It's a devastating blow to al Qaeda, though not a fatal one,\\" said Juan Zarate, who was deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism under President George W. Bush. \\"What this demonstrates is that we have the ability to get on the inside.\\" And the plot, by the same group that launched a failed attempt to bomb a U.S.-bound airliner on Christmas 2009, demonstrates the continued \\"rise of the affiliates,\\" he said. \\"We have a decimated al Qaeda core -- the al Qaeda of 2001 that we have battled and really dismantled in many ways has metastasized and is now presenting itself in this regional form.\\" This latest intelligence success marks the deepest known penetration into al Qaeda, said Ali Soufan, a former FBI official who oversaw highly sensitive international terrorism cases. But he noted many intelligence efforts remain secret. \\"It's a major success for the CIA and for the intelligence community,\\" he said. And, he noted, as in this case with Saudi Arabia, \\"overseas most of our work is done in cooperation with friendly services.\\" Of the al Qaeda affiliate groups trying to carry out terrorist operations today, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is the closest version to the network Osama bin Laden led, Soufan said. Bruce Riedel, who spent 30 years in the CIA and was a senior adviser on the Middle East to four presidents, said thwarting the bomb plot is \\"primarily a Saudi success story\\" -- and not their first. \\"They foiled the AQAP plot in October 2010 to send bombs to the U.S. on FedEx and UPS planes,\\" he noted. That plot was foiled by an informant. Some details remain unknown. This time, Riedel said, Saudi intelligence managed to \\"get access to AQAP's plot and actually get the bomb.\\" Still, thwarting this attack doesn't damage the organization substantially in the big picture, analysts said. \\"While this is a good technical success, the harsh reality is that in Yemen, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is growing, getting more powerful, recruiting more assets and taking advantage of the fact that Yemen is essentially the Humpty Dumpty of the Arabian Peninsula -- it's falling apart, broken,\\" said Riedel, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank added that while it is a \\"big intelligence success\\" for the United States and Saudi Arabia, \\"there's a limit to their success as well.\\" The operation did not lead intelligence services to Ibrahim al-Asiri, the chief bomb maker for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or to the location where he makes the bombs. \\"They were able to take out Fahd al-Quso, who's a senior operational planner in the group, but they were not able to take out this very dangerous bomb maker who's ingenious at making bombs,\\" Cruickshank noted. Information from the mole led to a CIA drone strike Sunday in Yemen that killed al-Quso, 37, a senior operative of the al Qaeda affiliate. He was a suspect in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen. He was convicted in a Yemeni court but escaped from jail. All the analysts who spoke to CNN expressed concern that a mole's involvement was leaked to the media. \\"I think authorities, particularly the CIA, would rather not talk about this right now,\\" said Zarate, now a senior adviser on counterterrorism for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. These kinds of sources \\"can lead to additional counterterrorism successes or insights,\\" he said. \\"So the fact that this is now front page news certainly doesn't help.\\" Soufan, who runs a consultancy group on security issues, said, \\"When you're doing operations like this, you have to do whatever you can do to protect sources and methods -- not only of the CIA but also of the other intelligence services that were involved in this. Because down the road they will be hesitant to cooperate with us.\\" However, Zarate said, there may be a bit of a silver lining in the leak. \\"I think what this will do is it will increase the amount of vigilance and mistrust within al Qaeda circles to outsiders. They need outsiders to supplement their ranks and allow them to plot against the West. ... It will create layers of distrust and will create inefficiencies,\\" Zarate said.

When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. and the situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: In what year did the colony established by Robert Cavelier de La Salle fail? is inside the article: The French colonization of Texas began with the establishment of a fort in present-day southeastern Texas. It was established in 1685 near Arenosa Creek and Matagorda Bay by explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle. He intended to found the colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead 400 miles (640 km) to the west, off the coast of Texas. The colony survived until 1688. The present-day town of Inez is near the fort's site. The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny. Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country, help never made it to the fort. Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony. Spain learned of La Salle's mission in 1686.

Problem: Solve -104749*j = -104707*j - 1050 for j. And the answer is...","completion":"Sure, let's solve the problem step-by-step as if we were solving a little puzzle! So, we've got: -104749*j = -104707*j - 1050 We need to make j all by itself on one side. Let's begin by moving the -104707*j from the right side to the left side of the equation. When we move something across the equals sign (like saying, \\"You! Go to the other side!\\"), we have to change its sign. So, -104707*j changes to positive 104707*j. Our equation now looks like this: -104749*j + 104707*j = -1050 Now, on the left side of the equation, we can combine the -104749*j and the 104707*j (just like if you owe your friend 104749 candies and then you give him 104707 candies back, you would then owe him the difference, which is 42 candies). So, -104749 + 104707 = -42. Therefore, this gives us -42*j on the left side: -42*j = -1050 Next, we want j all by itself, which means getting rid of the -42. We do this by dividing both sides by -42 (it's like saying if you have 42 apples and you equally share them with your friends, how many would everyone have). So, -1050 divided by -42 is: j = 25 And there we have it, j equals to 25! So if you had 25 candies then it would all balance out just right and everyone would be happy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(A). different meanings (B). the same meaning","completion":"In both sentences, the word \\"butt\\" shares the same core meaning, referring to the posterior or buttocks of a person. However, the context in which the word \\"butt\\" is used results in subtle differences in implied meaning. To understand the nuances better, let's take a closer look at each sentence. 1. \\"He deserves a good kick in the butt.\\" In this sentence, \\"butt\\" refers to the person's posterior. The speaker is expressing that the person mentioned should be metaphorically or literally kicked in the buttocks. The kick is acting as a form of punishment or motivation for the person mentioned. The objective here is to emphasize the need for direct action or correction in response to the person's behavior or choices. 2. \\"Get your butt to the car.\\" In this case, \\"butt\\" still refers to the person's posterior, but the speaker is using the word in a more colloquial and informal sense. The speaker is essentially telling the other person to move quickly and get themselves to the car. Here, the term \\"butt\\" is employed as a directive for action, conveying urgency or impatience in the given situation. Although the core meaning of \\"butt\\" is the same, the distinguishing factor lies in the context and intent of the speaker. It's essential to note that language is fluid, and meanings can shift based on context, tone, and intention. Thus, in this scenario, the word \\"butt\\" has the same fundamental definition but is used to express (A) different meanings in each sentence due to context and speaker's intent."},{"prompt":"Q: If pressure is exerted on the rock from one direction, the rock forms layers. this is called what?

Q: Yesterday on my way home, I was following behind a school bus that had a sign in the back of his (or her, not sure of the gender) window saying “no kids on board”. The bus swerved a little bit out of the lane and then continued along just fine. It approached a T shaped intersection with 3 stop signs. The bus and I are going on the top of this T and there’s typically no one ever at this intersection in any direction when I come through. I was surprised to see that he applied brake for a very quick second then continued through the stop sign like it didn’t even exist. I got the whole thing on my dash cam including license plate and vehicle number and not sure if I should share it or not with the school district. On the one hand, there were no children on board at the time (also didn’t see any in any of the windows in addition to the sign), and there typically isn’t anyone at this intersection, so it’s not like they put anyone in danger *at this moment*. However, I do consider this to be dangerous driving. The brief swerve before the stop sign makes me feel like the driver was distracted and didn’t see the sign which is dangerous driving either that or figured no one was around to make stopping necessary. Me, I’m not a school bus driver and I was alone in the car and I stopped at the stop sign because that’s the law and even though no one appeared to be there, I never know if someone will gun it through or be hidden somewhere. I don’t know if he would or would not have done this if children were on board, but this makes me feel like they’re not a great driver and deserve whatever disciplinary action would follow as a result of my sharing of the video.

Write highlights for this article: In the push to free an American woman from a Mexican prison, a video shown in court Thursday could be key. The security camera footage shows Yanira Maldonado and her husband boarding a bus in Mexico last week. They are carrying a purse, two blankets and two bottles of water. It's an everyday scene that plays out at bus stations around the world. But in this case, defense attorney Francisco Benitez argues that the images are a crucial piece of evidence. Why? Because nothing they're carrying, he argues, could hold the amount of marijuana that Yanira Maldonado is accused of smuggling. Maldonado, a Mormon mother of seven, has been in a Mexican jail for more than a week. Authorities accuse her of trying to smuggle 12 pounds of marijuana under a bus seat. She has maintained her innocence, and the case has drawn widespread media coverage and attention from U.S. lawmakers as family members push for her freedom. The revelation of the video comes at a key juncture in the case. A Mexican judge must decide by Friday whether there's enough evidence to charge Maldonado with drug trafficking. If she's not charged, Maldonado must be released, Benitez said. The video footage shown in court Thursday suggests that someone else brought the marijuana aboard the bus, the lawyer said. The packages of marijuana allegedly recovered from under Maldonado's seat would not have fit in her purse, Benitez said. Maldonado's attorneys also presented documents that show that she and her husband, Gary, have no criminal records in the United States, Benitez said. Word that the surveillance video had been shown in court was a big relief, Gary Maldonado told reporters Thursday night. \\"That was the key that would help us prove her innocence,\\" he said. Prosecutors' efforts to say the drugs could be hidden inside the blankets won't win the day, he said. \\"It showed right on the film clear as day there's no way you could carry 12 pounds or 5.7 kilos with one arm. You could see me fold the blankets curled up,\\" he said. The Mexican military officials who arrested Maldonado haven't made their case yet in court. The soldiers were scheduled to appear Wednesday but didn't show. Maldonado's family denies the charges and are optimistic the case against her is crumbling. Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado on May 22 as she and her husband were on their way back to Arizona. Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe. A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Maldonado was framed. A regional office of Mexico's defense ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and found 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat. Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office, the defense ministry said. Maldonado is being housed in a women's prison in Nogales while authorities decide her fate. In an interview Wednesday with CNN, Maldonado said she has been turning to Scripture to survive the ordeal. \\"Reading the Scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, fasting,\\" Maldonado said. \\"And all the support that I've been getting from my family, my husband, my children and everybody out there reaching out to help.\\" Family members' tearful pleas for her release have drawn widespread media attention to the case and caught the attention of U.S. officials. \\"I am watching this very, very closely,\\" said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Arizona. \\"After the hearing tomorrow, if I have concerns, I may end up having to go to Mexico myself and get involved in this thing personally.\\" Salmon said he's spoken about the case with the U.S. ambassador to Mexico and Mexico's ambassador in Washington. \\"This case gets stranger by the minute,\\" Salmon said, \\"and I think most Americans as they've been watching it unfold have a lot of concerns.\\" Salmon said witnesses' testimony that Maldonado was only carrying a purse when she got on the bus is among the details that caught his attention. \\"What concerns me more than anything is that I want to make sure justice is met. I want to make sure that she is treated with every courtesy and fairness that we would expect in our own judicial system,\\" he said. State Department officials said consular officials met with Maldonado Wednesday and last Friday, and are in regular contact by phone. U.S. diplomats are doing the same things they usually would when a U.S. citizen is arrested in a foreign country, but maybe to a higher degree because of the high-profile nature of the case, a senior administration official said. On Thursday night, Gary Maldonado said his wife was in good spirits. \\"She was in a good mood,\\" he said. \\"She feels like she was going to get out, since we have the evidence that proves her innocence.\\" CNN's Christine Theodorou, Casey Wian, Elise Labott and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.

Process: - Air is taken through the mouth - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is panicking happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a person panicking can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of oxygen reaching the body. When a person panics, their breathing pattern is affected, which can interfere with the efficient intake and distribution of oxygen. There are several ways in which this can happen: 1. Rapid breathing (hyperventilation): During a panic attack, a person tends to breathe rapidly, which leads to hyperventilation. Hyperventilation causes the balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body to be disrupted, leading to lower levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to be efficiently released from the hemoglobin in red blood cells to the body's tissues, resulting in less oxygen reaching the body. 2. Shallow breathing: In addition to breathing rapidly, a person who is panicking may also take more shallow breaths. This means that the air inhaled is not reaching the deeper parts of the lungs where oxygen exchange is most efficient. As a result, less oxygen is taken in and passed throughout the body. 3. Decreased lung capacity: Anxiety and panic may cause constriction of the airways, making it more difficult for air to pass through and for the lungs to fully expand. This constriction can lead to a decrease in lung capacity, which means that less oxygen is available to be distributed throughout the body. 4. Increased heart rate: During a panic attack, the heart rate typically increases, causing the circulatory system to work harder. This increased demand for oxygen can make it more challenging for the body to provide adequate oxygen to all of its tissues and organs, contributing to the problem of less oxygen reaching the body. Overall, the perturbation caused by panicking can have a significant impact on the process of oxygen reaching the body. The direct effects are primarily due to changes in breathing patterns, while indirect effects may include increased heart rate and decreased lung capacity, making it more difficult for oxygen to be efficiently distributed throughout the body. To overcome the effects of panic on oxygenation, it is important to practice slow, deep breathing techniques and seek appropriate treatment for anxiety and panic disorders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The attack is interrupted when a meteorite falls from the sky into a nearby car, giving Samantha the chance to escape. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a pale, hairless, eyeless dog-sized creature; the object which fell from the sky was its cocoon. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the corpse to their acquaintance, cannabis dealer Ron (Nick Frost), to get advice on what to do. He lives at the top of their tower block, Wyndham Tower. Moses asks Ron and his boss, Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter), to keep the creature in their fortified \\"weed room\\" while he decides how to proceed.

Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by two policemen and Moses is arrested, identified as a mugger by Samantha. The aliens, following Moses, maul the police to death and attack their van, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives the van away, only to crash into Hi-Hatz's car. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz.

He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name.

Write highlights for this article: Wrapped in heavy coats against the November chill, thousands of visitors crowd onto the paths circling the Tower of London to catch a glimpse of the extraordinary \\"sea\\" of crimson filling the castle's moat below. The blood-red tide which flows from one of the palace's windows and laps at its ancient stone walls is made of hundreds of thousands of individually handcrafted ceramic poppies. Each of the 888,246 blooms in the artwork, \\"Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red,\\" represents a life lost in World War I -- one for each of the British and Colonial soldiers killed in the conflict that began 100 years ago. And as Britain commemorates Armistice Day in the war's centenary year, the final poppy will be \\"planted\\" shortly before 11am on November 11, the time at which the armistice was signed, ending the war in 1918. Once the evolving artwork, which began with the planting of the first poppy by Tower of London Yeoman Warder Crawford Butler on July 17, is \\"complete\\" a lone bugler will play the Last Post, signaling the start of two minutes' silence in memory of the war dead. Less than 24 hours later, the army of thousands of volunteers who helped put it together will sweep in and begin dismantling it, \\"picking\\" each flower. The poppies will then be checked, cleaned and packed before being shipped to their new owners -- each has been sold, for Â£25 (about 40), to benefit six armed forces charities. But following widespread calls for the hugely popular installation to remain in place longer, even until 2018, leaving them at the Tower for the duration of the WWI anniversary, organizers said two parts of the display would be kept in place until the end of November. The \\"weeping window\\" and the \\"wave\\" of poppies across the path leading into the Tower will then be taken on a tour of the UK, before becoming part of the permanent exhibitions at the Imperial War Museums in London and Manchester. Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), the organization which runs the Tower of London, tweeted: \\"We're pleased to confirm that these two major features of the #TowerPoppies will be going on national tour until 2018.\\" HRP says in excess of 4 million people -- between 60,000 and 70,000 a day -- are expected to have visited the installation by the time it ends. In a statement, British Prime Minister David Cameron said: \\"The poppy display at the Tower of London has in a very short space of time become a much loved and respected monument. \\"We want to ensure that as many people as possible have the opportunity to witness it ... By displaying parts of the installation around the country and then permanently in the Imperial War Museum, we have ensured that this poignant memorial will be saved for the nation.\\" The HRP spokeswoman told CNN that the display's creators, ceramic artist Paul Cummins and theater designer Tom Piper, had always intended it to be an evolving memorial. \\"That was very much part of the artists' intentions, the transient nature of it, as is the idea that it will then be dispersed, that the poppies will find new homes,\\" she said. HRP and Transport for London have warned those heading to the Tower to see the poppies in their last days and weeks that there are likely to be large crowds in the area, and that public transport and Tube stations nearby will be far busier than usual. In order to allow more people to experience it, the artwork has been illuminated until midnight each evening. There are reports that some of those who have bought the blooms are trying to cash in on the enormous popularity of the installation by selling their flowers on internet auction site eBay for more than double their original price. An eBay spokesman told Britain's Daily Mail newspaper that such inappropriate listings would be canceled. Cameron praised all of those involved in the \\"extraordinary project,\\" which he said had \\"brought forward from the British public a huge amount of reverence for those who have given their lives and served our country.\\" \\"The numbers going to see this display have been truly extraordinary,\\" he said at the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session in parliament, adding that money raised from the sale of the poppies was likely to fund valuable work by veterans' charities. Poppies have been used as a way of commemorating World War I for decades -- in Britain, thousands of paper flowers are sold for charity each year to be worn in people's lapels. The flowers grew over the battlefields of northern France and Belgium, inspiring one of the most famous poems written about the conflict, by John McCrae: \\"In Flanders fields the poppies blow, Between the crosses, row on row ...\\" READ MORE: Poppy hijab honors Muslims, sparks controversy.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Juan Alberto Gonzalez Vazquez (born October 20, 1969), nicknamed \\"Igor\\", is a former Major League Baseball right fielder. During his 16 years in the league, Gonzalez played for four teams, but is more remembered for his two stints with the Texas Rangers (1989-1999, 2002-2003). One of the premier run producers and most feared hitters of the 1990s, Gonzalez averaged 37 HR and 117 runs batted in per season from 1991 to 1999. He won the AL MVP award twice in that time span, 1996 and 1998. Gonzalez grew up in a rough area of Puerto Rico, where he learned to hit bottlecaps and corks with a broomstick handle in the Alto de Cuba barrio. In the Puerto Rico youth league, Gonzalez batted cleanup behind future Yankee center fielder Bernie Williams, where both competed against Gonzalez's future teammate Ivan Rodriguez. When the Yankees scouted Williams, eventually signing him, they declined to pursue Gonzalez, who they perceived as not serious about baseball. The Texas Rangers signed Gonzalez as an amateur free agent on May 30, 1986, at the age of 16. Gonzalez has always wanted to serve as a role model for the kids of Puerto Rico, as they are faced with the downfalls of drugs and prostitution frequently. Gonzalez avoided such temptations growing up. His father, a math teacher, and mother, a housewife, made sure Gonzalez and his two sisters behaved properly and stayed away from negative influences. Gonzalez moved his family out of the barrio early in his MLB career. He paid utility bills for down-on-their-luck friends and plans on working to construct recreation facilities and a baseball diamond in his home town. One of Juan's managers, Johnny Oates, believed that until you've walked where Juan Gonzalez has walked, you just won't understand. Speaking from experience, as Oates has walked the streets of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, during visits multiple times, he had this to say: \\"I don't think you can appreciate how far he's come until you've been there\\", Oates said. \\"We might be making choices between going to the movies or going to the skating rink. But look at the choices the kids there were faced with growing up - do you want to do drugs or get beaten up? I think it says so much about him that he was able to rise above the peer pressure in Vega Baja. He had enough intelligence to say, 'I don't want to do that.'\\" In Puerto Rico he is known as \\"Igor\\", the nickname he has carried since he was a nine-year-old fascinated by the professional wrestler \\"Igor the Magnificent.\\" \\"I watched wrestling all the time and I still like it\\", Gonzalez said. \\"One day when I was nine, I told another guy, 'I'm Igor.'

Plants like cacti have thick and fleshy stems, which are designed to store water during periods of drought. The water-storing capacity of the stem, combined with the plant's ability to perform photosynthesis in the absence of leaves, allows desert plants to conserve precious water resources efficiently. While some other plants may store water in their leaves or branches, the stem is the most common and effective location for desert plants to store water. The adaptability of these plants enables them to grow in harsh environments where water is scarce. In addition to the well-known cactus species, other desert plants like euphorbias and aloes also store water in their stems to survive in arid conditions. Some plants, such as the succulents, can store water in both their leaves and stems, further increasing their capacity to withstand droughts. In contrast, answer choices like \\"In the spines,\\" \\"peachleaf willow,\\" \\"scarce resources,\\" \\"bamboo,\\" and \\"In the branches\\" do not accurately address the question, as they do not describe the typical water storage strategies employed by desert plants. While some cacti do have spines, these are for protection, not for storing water. In conclusion, \\"In the stem\\" is the best answer, as it accurately reflects the primary method of water storage in desert plants such as cacti, which are well-adapted to thrive in hot and dry environments. Their ability to store significant amounts of water in their stems allows them to survive in environments where other plants struggle to exist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

My father just kept smoking and my mother put her head down and couldn't help crying. What I saw didn't make me surprise. I knew very well what my family was like. My mum had been in bed for two years because of her disease. I knew my family lived a hard life and couldn't afford my tuition fee . I felt so upset at that moment, but I could say nothing to my parents. I decided to help my father with his work to support my family instead of continuing my schooling.

Process: - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body. suppose earth doesn't have a volcano happens, how will it affect MORE body cooling occurring. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"If the Earth does not experience any volcanic activity, it could lead to indirect impacts on the body cooling process. The absence of volcanoes may result in alterations to the Earth's climate system, which could in turn affect the evaporation process and our body's ability to cool itself. This perturbation could indirectly impact the steps of the process. A change in the Earth's climate, due to the lack of volcanic activity, could have a variety of consequences. One possibility is that the planet becomes warmer overall, due to the absence of the sulfate aerosols that are released into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions. These aerosols reflect sunlight and thus have a cooling effect on the Earth's temperature. If the Earth became warmer, this could affect the body cooling process in different ways. In warmer conditions, our bodies may need to work harder to maintain a stable internal temperature. This increased effort could cause more sweating and a greater need for efficient evaporation. On the other hand, if the lack of volcanic activity were to cause a drop in Earth's temperature, our body cooling process could be impacted in the opposite way. In cooler conditions, our bodies might not require as much sweating to maintain a comfortable temperature, and so the process of evaporation and shedding molecules into the air could become less important. It's also possible that regional climates would react differently to the absence of volcanic activity. Some areas might become warmer, while others could become cooler or more humid, which would affect how our bodies respond to these changes. In summary, while the absence of volcanic activity on Earth does not directly impact the steps in the body cooling process, it could indirectly impact the process by altering the Earth's climate system. This change could either increase or decrease the need for efficient body cooling, depending on various factors such as regional climate, overall temperature changes, and the body's adapted mechanisms against these alterations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Matt Warren, of Swansea's TechHub and the Veeqo online retail firm, called on the Welsh Government to offer more loans as well as grants and for Finance Wales to become less \\"risk averse\\". He said high risk business was needed for growth and employment. But Finance Wales said it was committed to fostering a vibrant and positive technology sector in Wales. Mr Warren made the calls as his firm Veeqo, which helps online retailers increase profit by managing orders across different websites like Amazon and Ebay, launched an online campaign to raise £2m from venture capitalists. Established in 2013 in Mr Warren's kitchen, the company now employs 30 people, and has a £1m revenue. In 2014, it received a £50,000 Welsh Government Digital Development Fund grant, which Mr Warren said helped him attract private investment. But he has now called on the Welsh Government to introduce more repayable loans, as well as grants. \\"The sort of companies who are interested in grants don't tend to be the ones who want to grow really big,\\" he said. \\"With a loan, the company is going to have spend the money well and think really hard about what they want to do with it.\\" Finance Wales need to become more innovative, he said, and added that the institution is \\"government-led and risk averse.\\" \\"The tech industry is high risk, but it brings big rewards,\\" he added. \\"Finance Wales tend to invest in more low-risk, traditional industries. But these aren't the companies who are going to employ thousands of people in the future.\\" But Steve Smith, technology venture investments director at Finance Wales, said a number of funds support new digital firms, including the £10m Wales technology venture investment fund and the £7.5m technology seed fund, both backed by the Welsh Government. Finance Wales also have a team who specialise in helping early stage technology companies. He said: \\"Since April this year, this team has invested over £5.5m in nearly 30 Welsh companies. An active co-investor, our investments are usually matched by the private sector. \\"We're committed to fostering a vibrant and positive technology sector in Wales.\\" And a Welsh Government spokesperson said Veeqo had \\"thrived with their support\\". It said it was aiming to launch a Development Bank of Wales next year, and that latest figures showed \\"above average survival rates\\" for companies backed by the Welsh Government. The spokesperson added: \\"We are always seeking to improve, and are currently working on refreshing our economic priorities so we can continue to build a fairer, more prosperous, and more secure Wales. \\"Business finance is one of many issues being considered as part of this work.\\" Veeqo's growth reflects a rise in Swansea's digital sector. The city's TechHub, which Mr Warren co-founded, houses 20 digital start-ups, employing up to 300 people. Swansea is set to be the first area of Wales to receive an ultra fast broadband connection, the city council plan to set up a 'city digital district', and Swansea could be home to the world's largest interactive digital screens for learning about science and technology. Prof Paul Hannon, director of Swansea University's institute for entrepreneurial leadership, said: \\"Matt's success with Veeqo is an inspiring story that will provide further encouragement to Welsh small to medium enterprises (SMEs) looking to take their businesses to the next level, which will undoubtedly add significant value to our local economy.\\"","completion":"Swansea-based online retail firm, Veeqo, has called on the Welsh Government to offer more loans and grants to tech start-ups in Wales to support growth and employment; it has also suggested Finance Wales should be more open to riskier investments in the technology sector."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which city disrupted fewer ocean food webs? Bend city used a lot of fossil fuels to generate electricity. Hop city, another city from the same county, used only alternative sources of energy. Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Hop city disrupted fewer ocean food webs. The reasoning behind this can be derived from the information given about the two cities' energy sources and their potential impact on the ozone layer. Bend city utilized a significant amount of fossil fuels to generate electricity, which contributes to air pollution. This pollution can result in the release of chlorine and bromine gases, which are identified as the primary culprits in the destruction of the ozone layer. The loss of ozone has several consequences, including the disturbance of the nitrogen cycle, the death of plankton, and disruption of ocean food webs. On the other hand, Hop city used only alternative sources of energy instead of fossil fuels. Alternative energy sources typically have a lower impact on air pollution levels and do not result in the release of harmful gases like fossil fuels. Therefore, Hop city's use of alternative energy sources likely contributed less to the depletion of the ozone layer and, as a result, disrupted fewer ocean food webs than Bend city. The hint in the passage highlights the negative effects of air pollution on the ozone layer and the consequences for life on Earth, including implications for ocean food webs. Using this information, it is clear that Hop city, with its use of cleaner alternative energy sources, disrupted fewer ocean food webs than Bend city, which relied on polluting fossil fuels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a hypothesis: I did not think that John Cavendish loved his wife. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"In analyzing the given premise and hypothesis, it is important to determine their compatibility and if one can lead to the other. Based on the premise and hypothesis provided, the compatibility is as follows: Premise: That John Cavendish still loved his wife, I was convinced. Hypothesis: I did not think that John Cavendish loved his wife. The premise states that the belief is that John Cavendish still loves his wife, while the hypothesis contradicts the premise by stating that the belief is that he does not love his wife. To conclude whether the hypothesis can be true if the premise is true, we must examine the logical relationship between the two statements. In this case, the two statements represent contradictory beliefs. In the realm of logic, there are four different ways two statements can relate to each other: contradiction, contrariety, subcontrariety, and subalternation. Contradiction occurs when both statements cannot be true and cannot be false at the same time. In other words, if one statement is true, the other must be false, and vice versa. Contrariety occurs when both statements cannot be true but can be false at the same time. Subcontrariety occurs when both statements can be true but cannot be false at the same time. Subalternation occurs when the truth of one statement implies the truth of another, while the falsity of that latter statement implies the falsity of the former. Since the hypothesis directly opposes the premise, they are in a relationship of contradiction. As a result, we cannot conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis would also be true. If the premise holds, then John Cavendish still loves his wife. In this case, the hypothesis, which claims that John Cavendish does not love his wife, would be false. If the premise is indeed true, the hypothesis must be false due to the contradictory nature of the relationship between the two statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are different opinions on plastic and paper. Now let's follow the travels of 3 plastic bags. It begins at the grocery store with the customer's choice. Plastic Bag 1: As the waste engineer come by and pick up the trash, the first plastic bag falls out. It sits on a small street for a couple of hours until a car comes along and takes it down to the road. Then a gust of wind blows it across the road, then another car, then another gust of wind finally makes its way to the beach. Water fills the plastic bag and makes it look like a jellyfish. A seal swims by, thinking it looks very interesting, and swallowed it. The plastic bag may stay in the seal's stomach for months, maybe years. You see, our lovely animals have been living thousands of years in a world where everything can be eaten. Plastic Bag 2: This bag does make its way to landfill . Before they have a chance to cover up the thousands of pounds of daily waste, a strong wind comes up and blows these plastic bags out of the landfill. Once the wind stops, workers will be sent to collect thousands of bags around. But they can't possibly get them all. So our little bag continues his adventure getting caught in trees, eaten by birds or making its way to our lakes or rivers. Plastic Bag 3: The last bag also blows away but is caught in a landfill where it sits for many years, as all the trash is wrapped in a big plastic bag, making natural degradation impossible.

They are related to different aspects of web development using HTML and CSS. Let me explain each question in detail. 1. How do you create a box filled with a color with HTML / CSS? This question pertains to creating a rectangular box with a specified background color using HTML and CSS. To achieve this, you need to create an HTML element with a specific width and height and apply CSS styles to add background color. Here's an example: HTML: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Colored Box Example</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"styles.css\\"> </head> <body> <div class=\\"colored-box\\"></div> </body> </html> \`\`\` CSS (styles.css): \`\`\`css .colored-box { width: 200px; height: 200px; background-color: blue; } \`\`\` In this example, the \`<div>\` element with the class \\"colored-box\\" is given a width and height of 200 pixels and assigned a background color of blue. 2. \\"I made an excellent contact form. How do I make it (using HTML and CSS), that when someone hits 'submit', the filled-out form gets emailed to me?\\" This question is related to creating a functional contact form that sends an email to the specified email address when the form is submitted. To achieve this, you need to use HTML to create the form elements and CSS to style the form. However, just using HTML and CSS is not enough to send an email from the form submission. You'll need to use some server-side logic (e.g., PHP, Node.js, etc.) to handle the email sending process or use a third-party service like Formspree or Netlify. Here's an example using Formspree: HTML: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Contact Form Example</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"styles.css\\"> </head> <body> <form action=\\"https://formspree.io/YOUREMAILHERE\\" method=\\"POST\\"> <label for=\\"name\\"> Name: <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"name\\" name=\\"name\\" required> </label> <label for=\\"email\\"> Email: <input type=\\"email\\" id=\\"email\\" name=\\"email\\" required> </label> <label for=\\"message\\"> Message: <textarea id=\\"message\\" name=\\"message\\" rows=\\"4\\" required></textarea> </label> <button type=\\"submit\\">Submit</button> </form> </body> </html> \`\`\` CSS (styles.css): \`\`\`css form { display: flex; flex-direction: column; width: 300px; } label { margin-bottom: 10px; } input, textarea { width: 100%; } button { background-color: blue; color: white; font-size: 1rem; padding: 5px; cursor: pointer; } button:hover { background-color: darkblue; } \`\`\` In this example, a contact form with input fields for name, email, and message is created, and the form submission process is handled by Formspree.

Background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). Paragraph: There was a soccer match between Red team and Blue team. Blue team got there early, warmed up properly and were ready for the game. Red team arrived late and almost skipped warming up entirely. Costly decision, as it turns out, because they lost.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Although your body requires sodium in small amounts, consuming too much sodium is bad for you and can lead to hypertension, heart disease and stroke. If you suffer from high blood pressure, take steps to reduce your sodium intake: Do not add salt to foods when cooking but use other spices instead (cumin, lemon pepper, fresh herbs). Rinse canned foods to remove sodium. Buy foods that are labeled “low sodium” or “sodium free.” Avoid processed foods, such as crackers, fried items, and baked goods, that often are high in sodium. Also avoid eating fast food and ask for reduced sodium when ordering in restaurants. A high fiber diet may help reduce your risk of hypertension. Fortunately, it’s easy to get fiber from the healthy foods you’re likely already eating. Incorporate more whole grains, fresh veggies, and fruit with the skin on it into your diet. This will help you consume at least 25 grams of fiber each day. Make sure you get at least six to eight servings of whole grains every day. Switch refined grains to whole grains, such as brown rice and whole wheat pasta and bread. Potassium-rich foods should be a part of your hypertension management diet. Foods you should add include sweet potatoes, tomatoes, kidney beans, orange juice, bananas, peas, potatoes, dried fruits, melon and cantaloupe. Keep your target potassium levels moderate (around 2,000 to 4,000 mg a day). Dark chocolate may help lower blood pressure, though it might not work the same for everyone. Eat dark chocolate whenever you’re craving a treat. Choose a bar that has at least 70% cocoa. Eat a half an ounce of dark chocolate that has at least 70% of cocoa per day. Because dark chocolate is high in calories, be sure not to overindulge. Besides being bad for blood pressure, caffeine and alcohol also have other negative health effects to you and your baby during pregnancy. Thus, you should avoid both, especially if you suffer from high blood pressure. Drinking caffeine during pregnancy has been linked to declined placental blood flow and a risk of miscarriage. Although more studies are needed to confirm the effects of caffeine, it is best to switch to decaf during your pregnancy. High alcohol consumption is known to raise blood pressure and it is also known to have negative effects on your unborn baby. Before drinking any alcohol, even just one glass of wine, consult your doctor. A clinical study demonstrated that systolic blood pressure can be lowered by adding these foods to your diet. Add low-fat or fat-free dairy products (such as milk, cottage cheese, yogurt) to your diet. If you are lactose intolerant, try a milk alternative, such as almond, coconut, or hemp milk. You can also try soy milk, but you may want to limit soy products during pregnancy since it may increase estrogen levels in your fetus. Go easy on the amount of cheese you eat (even low-fat) due to their high sodium content.","completion":"The article provides dietary recommendations to reduce hypertension, such as lowering sodium intake, increasing fiber and potassium consumption, incorporating dark chocolate, avoiding caffeine and alcohol during pregnancy, and adding low-fat dairy products to one's diet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael thought that high school was a good place to start making friends. So, he put both Protestant and Catholic students together on one team. Can you imagine being on a team with people who are different from you? Maybe it was a little scary at first, but Michael believed that if people worked together and had fun, they would become friends. And guess what? It worked! Even after these students graduated from high school, they still stayed friends with each other. They didn't let their differences stop them from caring about one another. Now, Northern Ireland can be a bit dangerous sometimes because of the disagreements between the two groups. This means that sometimes the friends cannot visit each other in person. But do you think that stopped them? No way! Instead, they found a way to keep talking to each other using something called the Internet. With the help of computers or smartphones, they can send messages and share pictures, just like magic! Even though they can't always see each other face-to-face, they still make sure to let their friends know they care.

I found the following answer on Google: Track and field events are generally individual sports with athletes challenging each other to decide a single victor. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct in stating that track and field events are generally individual sports where athletes challenge each other, competing to determine a single winner. However, this answer does not specifically address the question of which track and field event might be best suited for you. To determine the most appropriate event for you, several factors should be considered, including your physical abilities, personal preferences, and experience. 1. Physical abilities: Every track and field event demands different physical skills and attributes. Sprinters, for example, typically require explosive power and speed, while distance runners benefit from endurance and efficient running techniques. Jumpers and throwers, on the other hand, rely heavily on strength, flexibility, and coordination. It's essential to assess your strengths and weaknesses to determine which event may best align with your abilities. 2. Personal preferences: Track and field is a diverse sport offering a wide range of events, from sprints and hurdles to jumps and throws. It's crucial to consider your interests and what you enjoy most about athletics. If you prefer racing against the clock, you may be more suited to sprinting or middle-distance events. Conversely, if you enjoy testing your limits in jumps or throws, those events may be more to your liking. 3. Experience: Your previous experience in track and field can help determine the most suitable event for you. If you have consistently excelled in a specific event or find that you gravitate toward particular activities during training, this could be a strong indicator of where your talents lie. Additionally, consider seeking feedback from your coaches, teammates, or other experienced athletes who can offer objective opinions on your performance in different events. By examining these factors, you can better identify the track and field event that aligns with your abilities and preferences. If you are still unsure, consider experimenting with several events, either by participating in multiple competitions or by focusing on one for a season before trying another.

Jarmusch was born January 22, 1953, in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the middle of three children of middle-class suburbanites. His mother, of German and Irish descent, had been a reviewer of film and theatre for the Akron Beacon Journal before marrying his father, a businessman of Czech and German descent who worked for the B.F. Goodrich Company. She introduced Jarmusch to the world of cinema by leaving him at a local cinema to watch matinee double features such as Attack of the Crab Monsters and Creature From the Black Lagoon while she ran errands. The first adult film he recalls seeing was the 1958 cult classic Thunder Road, the violence and darkness of which left an impression on the seven-year-old Jarmusch. Jarmusch's final year university project was completed in 1980 as Permanent Vacation, his first feature film. It had its premiere at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg (formerly known as Filmweek Mannheim) and won the Josef von Sternberg Award. It was made on a shoestring budget of around 12,000 in misdirected scholarship funds and shot by cinematographer Tom DiCillo on 16 mm film. The 75 minute quasi-autobiographical feature follows an adolescent drifter (Chris Parker) as he wanders around downtown Manhattan. The film was not released theatrically, and did not attract the sort of adulation from critics that greeted his later work. The Washington Post staff writer Hal Hinson would disparagingly comment in an aside during a review of Jarmusch's Mystery Train (1989) that in the director's debut, \\"the only talent he demonstrated was for collecting egregiously untalented actors\\". The bleak and unrefined Permanent Vacation is nevertheless one of the director's most personal films, and established many of the hallmarks he would exhibit in his later work, including derelict urban settings, chance encounters, and a wry sensibility. Jarmusch's first major film, Stranger Than Paradise, was produced on a budget of approximately 125,000 and released in 1984 to much critical acclaim. A deadpan comedy recounting a strange journey of three disillusioned youths from New York through Cleveland to Florida, the film broke many conventions of traditional Hollywood filmmaking. It was awarded the Camera d'Or at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival as well as the 1985 National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film, and became a landmark work in modern independent film. In 1986, Jarmusch wrote and directed Down by Law, starring musicians John Lurie and Tom Waits, and Italian comic actor Roberto Benigni (his introduction to American audiences) as three convicts who escape from a New Orleans jailhouse. Shot like the director's previous efforts in black and white, this constructivist neo-noir was Jarmusch's first collaboration with Dutch cinematographer Robby Muller, who had been known for his work with Wenders. His next two films each experimented with parallel narratives: Mystery Train (1989) told three successive stories set on the same night in and around a small Memphis hotel, and Night on Earth (1991) involved five cab drivers and their passengers on rides in five different world cities, beginning at sundown in Los Angeles and ending at sunrise in Helsinki. Less bleak and somber than Jarmusch's earlier work, Mystery Train nevertheless retained the director's askance conception of America. He wrote Night on Earth in about a week, out of frustration at the collapse of the production of another film he had written and the desire to visit and collaborate with friends such as Benigni, Gena Rowlands, Winona Ryder and Isaach de Bankole. As a result of his early work, Jarmusch became an influential representative of the trend of the American road movie. Not intended to appeal to mainstream filmgoers, these early Jarmusch films were embraced by art house audiences, gaining a small but dedicated American following and cult status in Europe and Japan. Each of the four films had its premiere at the New York Film Festival, while Mystery Train was in competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. Jarmusch's distinctive aesthetic and auteur status fomented a critical backlash at the close of this early period, however; though reviewers praised the charm and adroitness of Mystery Train and Night On Earth, the director was increasingly charged with repetitiveness and risk-aversion. A film appearance in 1989 as a used car dealer in the cult comedy Leningrad Cowboys Go America further solidified his interest and participation in the road movie genre. In 1991 Jarmusch appeared as himself in Episode One of John Lurie's cult television series Fishing With John. In 1995, Jarmusch released Dead Man, a period film set in the 19th century American West starring Johnny Depp and Gary Farmer. Produced at a cost of almost 9 million with a high-profile cast including John Hurt, Gabriel Byrne and, in his final role, Robert Mitchum, the film marked a significant departure for the director from his previous features. Earnest in tone in comparison to its self-consciously hip and ironic predecessors, Dead Man was thematically expansive and of an often violent and progressively more surreal character. The film was shot in black and white by Robby Muller, and features a score composed and performed by Neil Young, for whom Jarmusch subsequently filmed the tour documentary Year of the Horse, released to tepid reviews in 1997. Though ill-received by mainstream American reviewers, Dead Man found much favor internationally and among critics, many of whom lauded it as a visionary masterpiece. It has been hailed as one of the few films made by a Caucasian that presents an authentic Native American culture and character, and Jarmusch stands by it as such, though it has attracted both praise and castigation for its portrayal of the American West, violence, and especially Native Americans. Following artistic success and critical acclaim in the American independent film community, he achieved mainstream recognition with his far-East philosophical crime film Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, shot in Jersey City and starring Forest Whitaker as a young inner-city man who has found purpose for his life by unyieldingly conforming it to the Hagakure, an 18th-century philosophy text and training manual for samurai, becoming, as directed, a terrifyingly deadly hit-man for a local mob boss to whom he may owe a debt, and who then betrays him. The soundtrack was supplied by RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, which blends into the director's \\"aesthetics of sampling\\". The film was unique among other things for the number of books important to and discussed by its characters, most of them listed bibliographically as part of the end credits. The film is also considered to be a homage to Le Samourai, a 1967 French New Wave film by auteur Jean-Pierre Melville, which starred renowned French actor Alain Delon in a strikingly similar role and narrative.

IKEA drives home reality of war with replica of Syrian dwelling Eager shoppers walking through IKEA's flagship Norway store were not expecting to find a spartan dwelling with bare walls among the furniture-maker’s display rooms. The Swedish furniture store collaborated with Red Cross to construct a 25 square-metre replica of an actual Syrian family's home in war-torn Damascus. It aimed to give people a tangible experience of life in the battered country, where many families live in bombed-out buildings with limited access to medicine and heating during the cold winter months. The home - which visitors can walk through as they would any other of the store's displays - is totally bare apart from a few rugs and humble furnishings. Rana, a mother of four young children, calls a similar tiny two-bedroom apartment in the suburb of Jaramana home. \\"When we had to flee to this area to find safety, we did not have enough money to rent a better place. We have no money to buy mattresses and blankets, or clothes for the children,\\" she told the Red Cross. The creative agency behind the fundraising activity said they were determined to make the experience as authentic as possible, and even built the house from concrete on site. \\"It would have been easier to put up wallpaper, but it wouldn't have felt the same,\\" art director Snorre Martinsen told AdWeek. \\"People who had fled war themselves have told us, 'This is how it feels, I remember this',\\". The installation, which was open to the public for two weeks, raised more than 22 million euros (A31.5 million) for Red Cross' efforts in Syria, with IKEA's iconic plastic price tags serving as donation slips. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2016 What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a unique collaboration between IKEA and the Red Cross to raise awareness about the living conditions of Syrian families in war-torn Damascus.

He called the journey back \\"the best ride I've been on ever\\", adding: \\"The smells of Earth are just so strong.\\" Maj Peake is the first person to fly to space under the UK banner since Helen Sharman in 1991 and made the first spacewalk by a UK astronaut. During the 186-day mission mission, Maj Peake also remotely steered a robot on Earth and ran the London Marathon. Just before 15:00 BST, Maj Peake landed by helicopter on the runway at Karagandy airport. But neither he nor his American colleague Tim Kopra made it to the subsequent press conference. They were presumed to be tired after their gruelling return journey. Later on Saturday, a Nasa gulfstream jet is due to fly Tim Peake to Norway. He will then go on to Cologne, Germany, where the European Astronaut Centre is based. His mission has taken him on about 3,000 orbits of Earth, covering a distance of about 125 million km. Asked how he felt after landing, Maj Peake said: \\"Truly elated, the smells of Earth are just so strong, just so good to be back on Earth. I'll look forward to seeing the family.\\" The spacecraft turned over several times after it landed relatively hard due to the wind speed on the Kazakh steppe.

At about 03:35 BST on Saturday, Maj Peake, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and Col Kopra made their farewells and entered the Russian Soyuz TMA-19M space capsule to return home from the International Space Station. After undocking at 06:53 BST, the Soyuz performed two separation burns to distance the spacecraft from the orbiting outpost. The vehicle then fired its engines again at 09:22 for a duration of four-and-a-half minutes to begin the re-entry through the atmosphere. Screaming towards Earth at 25 times the speed of sound, the Soyuz was enveloped in a fiery ball of superheated plasma. During this phase, the crew members inside can be subjected to forces of about 5Gs - a level at which some people pass out. As it neared the ground, the capsule deployed its parachutes to slow the descent, firing engines to cushion its landing on the steppe, near the Kazakh city of Dzhezkazgan at 10:15 BST. Dr Simon Evetts, from the UK's Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, said: \\"During re-entry, Tim will undergo significant strain on his body and will also feel the effects of his landmark mission for weeks to come. \\"Upon arrival, Tim will feel weaker due to muscle loss and reduced cardiovascular fitness, and will feel heavy in Earth's gravity.\\" Tim Peake in space: Want to know more?

Protein helps your body build and repair muscle cells and connective tissue. You also need protein to help transport nutrients throughout your body. Not getting enough protein can lead to your muscles breaking down over time, resulting in lower strength and energy. Elite endurance athletes should be consuming 1.3 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. Resistance athletes should be consuming between 1.0 and 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. Remember that pounds are approximately double the weight in kilograms. For example, a 150-pound (68-kilogram) endurance athlete should be eating about 92 to 108 grams of protein each day. Some foods contain more protein than others. How much protein-rich food you eat will depend on your dietary needs and the foods you choose to eat. To get 10 grams of protein from animal foods, you would need to eat either two eggs, 1.5 slices of cheese, one cup (250 milliliters) of milk, 40 grams of lean chicken, 50 grams of fish, or 200 grams of yogurt. To get 10 grams of protein from plant sources, you would need to eat either four slices of wholemeal bread, three cups of whole grain cereal, two cups of pasta, three cups of rice, 120 grams of tofu, 100 grams of soy \\"meat,\\" or 3/4 cup lentils. In addition to getting enough protein, you should ensure that you're consuming protein at the optimal times. You need protein throughout the day, but you should also boost your protein intake after training or competing. Ingesting large amounts of protein immediately after exercising helps your body take up and retain more amino acids. This, in turn, will help your body recover from exercise and repair muscle as needed. Make sure you continue to eat enough protein throughout the rest of the day. The increased uptake and retention of amino acids from protein consumed right after exercise will continue for up to 24 hours. This means that your protein source for breakfast will be used as rapidly as the protein you ate after a workout last night.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of consuming adequate protein for muscle building and repair, outlining daily intake recommendations for endurance and resistance athletes, and suggesting various animal and plant sources of protein, as well as the benefits of ingesting protein after exercise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is typical of right wing ignorance that a foreign enemy is needed as a stand-in for a real agenda. China will liberalize as globalism and the Internet take hold. Americans will not be tricked into a new cold war. These authors are as looney as Bill Gertz. Freak show journalists, with mail order educations. Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses strong disapproval and criticism of the book \\"Disinformation and Resentment,\\" stating that it is a politically motivated screed authored by individuals who long for the tensions of the Cold War era. The review labels the book as a representation of \\"right-wing ignorance\\" and finds flaws in the authors' agenda, suggesting that they are using China as a scapegoat for their political objectives of promoting a new cold war. Furthermore, the reviewer argues that the authors' views are outdated, as they believe that globalism and the internet will eventually lead China towards liberalization. This statement implies that the reviewer disagrees with the perspective put forth in the book and is optimistic about the potential for global interconnectedness to foster political and social change in China. In addition to criticizing the book's content and ideology, the reviewer also attacks the authors personally, labeling them as \\"looney\\" and comparing them to Bill Gertz, implying that the authors are unreasonable and extreme in their viewpoints. The reviewer goes so far as to discredit the authors' credentials by calling them \\"freak show journalists\\" with \\"mail-order educations,\\" casting doubt on their expertise and knowledge. Overall, the tone of this product review is dismissive and derogatory, with the reviewer providing a harsh assessment of both the book's content and the credibility of its authors. They make it clear that they do not recommend the book and express their belief that readers should not be swayed by the authors' viewpoints. This review is undoubtedly negative, as it portrays the book in an unfavorable light and discourages potential readers from engaging with its content."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What does Philip do to Murch after forgiving him? Movie title: Homecoming Movie plot: Richard and Karl are German prisoners of war in Siberia. Since escape is almost impossible, they are unguarded and live an almost idyllic existence running a ferry. Richard misses his wife Anna greatly; he literally counts the days since he's seen her and tells Karl about her and their home in detail. When he decides to escape, Karl comes with him. While crossing a desert Richard collapses. He asks Karl to go on without him, but Karl refuses to leave his friend and carries him. But when Karl leaves to get water, Richard is recaptured and sent to work in a lead mine. Karl makes it back to Hamburg, where he meets Anna and occupies a spare room in her flat. Soon friendship deepens, and both he and Anna have guilt feelings about their attraction. Meanwhile, the war ends, and Richard returns just in time to witness Karl and Anna's first kiss. After his initial anger, Richard goes to Anna's bed. She cries; he takes her in his arms; she returns his embrace; but when he begins to make love to her, she refuses his advances. Richard returns to the room where Karl pretends to be asleep. He takes a pistol and prepares to kill Karl; but as he holds the gun to Karl's head, he recalls his friend's carrying him across the desert and puts the pistol away. Realizing that \\"Nobody's to blame,\\" Richard leaves Karl and Anna to each other and returns to his other great passion, life at sea on one of the great freighters that sail from Hamburg.","completion":"I cannot answer what Philip does to Murch after forgiving him, as the provided movie plot does not include any characters named Philip or Murch. The movie plot revolves around the characters Richard, Karl, and Anna, where Richard and Karl are German prisoners of war in Siberia, and Anna is Richard's wife. The movie, titled \\"Homecoming,\\" tells the story of Richard and Karl's journey from being prisoners of war to eventually returning to Hamburg, where Karl meets Anna. Throughout the story, their friendship develops, and it even affects their relationships as their emotions intertwine. The war eventually ends, and Richard returns, but what he finds changes the dynamic between the three main characters. In this film, the themes of loyalty, friendship, guilt, and love are explored, creating a web of complex emotions and decisions among the characters. The plot calls for an introspective look at how deep friendships and partnerships shape our lives, especially during difficult times. The movie also addresses the necessity of self-reflection, forgiveness, and the understanding that life moves forward for all the involved characters.

Our present concern is with how easily and to what extent this cycle can be modified. The question is no mere academic one. The ease, for example, with which people can change from working in the day to working at night is a question of growing importance in industry where automation calls for round-the-clock working of machines. It normally takes from five days to one week for a person to adapt to a reversed routine of sleep and wakefulness, sleeping during the day and working at night. Unfortunately, it is often the case in industry that shifts are changed every week; a person may work from 12 midnight to 8 a.m. one week, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. the next, and 4 p.m. to 12 midnight the third and so on. This means that no sooner has he got used to one routine than he has to change to another, so that much of his time is spent neither working nor sleeping very efficiently. The only real solution appears to be to hand over the night shift to a number of permanent night workers. An interesting study of the domestic life and health of night-shift workers was carried out by Brown in 1957. She found a high incidence of disturbed sleep and other disorders among those on alternating day and night shifts, but no abnormal occurrence of these phenomena among those on permanent night work. This latter system then appears to be the best long-term policy, but meanwhile something may be done to relieve the pressure of alternate day and night work by selecting those people who can adapt most quickly to the changes of routine. One way of knowing when a person has adapted is by measuring his body temperature.

Joseph Krauzenberg is a very wealthy Hungarian Jewish industrial tycoon whose fortune is mirrored in the great palaces he owns. However, by 1944 his important businesses are needed by the Nazis and Hitler's 'Final Solution' is sweeping through Europe. The Nazis are greedy to accumulate wealth as easily as possible, and under the terms of the Third Reich's \\"Europa Plan\\", Krauzenberg arranges with Nazi leaders to exchange his fortune, his business holdings (textile plants, steel mills, ownership of several banks) and a collection of rare art for safe passage to Switzerland for himself, his wife Rachel, and their family. As the night of transaction approaches, Krauzenberg visits his large family being held by the Gestapo, and reassures them that all will be safe.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836.

Once upon a time in a small town, there lived a man named Mark. Mark wasn't exactly the healthiest person in town. He spent most of his days lazing around, eating junk food, and watching TV. This unhealthy lifestyle took a toll on Mark's body and mind, making him feel sluggish and out of shape. One day, while Mark was in his usual routine of binging on junk food and flipping channels, he saw a fitness program led by Logan. Logan was a personal trainer, and he radiated positivity, enthusiasm, and passion for health. Mark was captivated by Logan's energy and the way he encouraged people to adopt active lifestyles. Feeling inspired, Mark decided to heed Logan's advice and made the life-changing decision to break free from his unhealthy habits. He started working out daily, eating healthier, and made it a point to attend Logan's workout classes. Over time, Mark noticed significant improvements in his energy levels, strength, and overall well-being. Meanwhile, Robert, another personal trainer in town, also taught fitness classes. While he was an excellent trainer, Robert had a reputation for pushing his clients too hard and lacking empathy. Mark had attended a few of Robert's classes, but they left him feeling discouraged and demotivated. Mark's journey to better health wasn't always smooth sailing. There were setbacks, difficulties, and days when he felt like giving up. However, Logan's empathetic approach, support, and unwavering belief in Mark's potential kept him going. Logan always made the point to celebrate Mark's achievements, no matter how small, which boosted Mark's self-confidence and provided the fuel needed to continue on his journey. As Mark became more accustomed to his new, healthier lifestyle, the positive effects became visibly apparent. His weight gradually decreased, his body became more toned and muscular, and his stamina and endurance improved. He could participate in physical activities he once deemed impossible, and he felt happier, more optimistic, and rejuvenated. One year after Mark's life-changing decision, he participated in a charity marathon organized by the town. His newfound love for fitness motivated him to challenge himself and give back to the community. The marathon was a success, and Mark ran alongside many fitness enthusiasts, including Logan and Robert. At the end of the race, a small ceremony was held to honor the participants and celebrate their achievements. When Mark was asked to share a few words, he thanked Logan for his unwavering support and guidance. He credited Logan for helping him transform his life and become a healthier, happier person. Robert, who was present during the ceremony, couldn't help but feel a little disheartened over not being acknowledged for his efforts as a fitness trainer. Mark's words, however, were not meant to undermine Robert's contributions to the community but rather to highlight the profound impact Logan had on Mark's life. In the end, Logan's empathetic approach to fitness and his genuine care for Mark's well-being played a crucial role in Mark's transformation. It wasn't just the physical workouts and dietary advice that made a difference, but the unwavering belief, encouragement, and support Logan provided that ultimately helped Mark become the healthier man he was today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It expanded the Lacey Act's ban on interstate commerce to include mammals, reptiles, amphibians, mollusks and crustaceans.

And I marvelled more to see the two of us, both lovers of one lady and eager rivals, burying for the nonce our feuds, and with the same hope serving the same cause. We slept the night at Aird's store, and early the next morning found Ringan. A new Ringan indeed, as unlike the buccaneer I knew as he was unlike the Quaker. He was now the gentleman of Breadalbane, dressed for the part with all the care of an exquisite. He rode a noble roan, in his Spanish belt were stuck silver-hafted pistols, and a long sword swung at his side. When I presented Grey to him, he became at once the cavalier, as precise in his speech and polite in his deportment as any Whitehall courtier.

HILL’S BROTHER A DEADBEAT Hillary Rodham Clinton’s youngest sibling is a deadbeat dad who owes tens of thousands of dollars in child support to his politically connected ex, The Post has learned. In a disclosure that could prove embarrassing for his sister, Anthony Rodham has stiffed his former wife, Nicole Boxer, out of 75,000 in child support, as well as 55,000 in alimony, a source close to the case said. Including interest and various fees and expenses, the presidential candidate’s brother now owes Boxer – the daughter of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) – more than 158,000, the source said. The revelation that Rodham is delinquent with his payments won’t be a welcome development for Hillary Clinton, coming as the too-close-to-call battle for the Democratic presidential nomination reaches a fevered pitch and with the first votes to be cast in Iowa in exactly two weeks. Barbara Boxer has not endorsed a candidate in the race. Nicole Boxer received judgments from a Washington judge ordering Rodham to pay up earlier this year, but the cash-strapped business consultant has yet to fork over the hefty sums. “He has consistently been a deadbeat dad when it comes to paying child support and spousal support, despite the courts telling him over and over again that he must meet his obligations,” a source close to Nicole Boxer said. Rodham’s lawyer, Gwendolyn Jo Carlberg, said she would “not comment on the veracity of any figures that are the subject of private and confidential settlement negotiations, as this is a personal, family matter and is under seal.” She did say her client “fully intends to honor the judgment.” Nicole Boxer’s lawyer could not be reached for comment. Rodham, 53, married Boxer in the White House Rose Garden in 1994, when his brother-in-law, Bill Clinton, was president. The couple had a son, Zachary, two years later, but the political union came to an end in 2000. Fights over child support soon followed – at one point in 2002, Nicole charged that her ex hadn’t paid anything in six months. The latest support strife has been going on most of this past year, and Carlberg said her client has been trying to settle their differences in and out of court. She said a Superior Court judge ruled against Rodham earlier this year. “He strongly disagreed with the ruling, and so did I,” she said. “We appealed the decision, and Mr. Rodham did not prevail.” That final ruling was in October. Carlberg said she “sent a settlement letter to Ms. Boxer’s attorney a few weeks ago for structured payment. As of today, we have not received a reply.” The Nicole Boxer source blasted Rodham’s settlement offers as “just another dodge from meeting his obligations to his former wife and son while he lives in his fancy Washington town house” with his new wife, whom he married in 2005. A former insurance salesman, prison guard and private eye, Rodham has been a headache for the former and possibly future first family before. He and his brother Hugh embarrassed the Clintons in 1999 with a politically perilous plan to import hazelnuts from the former Soviet republic of Georgia. He also became a figure in the “Pardongate” scandal, when it was revealed that he lobbied Bill Clinton to pardon two embezzlers. Rodham made headlines again shortly after his split from Nicole, when he was attacked at his family cottage in the Berkshires by a man who claimed he saw Rodham having sex with his girlfriend. Rodham later testified that he “might have” smoked pot with the woman. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Hillary Clinton's brother, Anthony Rodham, allegedly owes his ex-wife, Nicole Boxer, tens of thousands of dollars in child support and alimony, possibly causing embarrassment for Hillary as the Democratic presidential nomination reaches a critical point."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Arabic weddings (Arabic: zff, frH, or \`rs) have changed greatly in the past 100 years. Original traditional Arabic weddings are supposed to be very similar to modern-day Bedouin weddings and rural weddings, and they are in some cases unique from one region to another, even within the same country. it must be mentioned that what some people today call \\"Bedouin\\" wedding is in fact the original true traditional Arab Islamic wedding without foreign influence. The marriage process usually starts with meetings between the couple's families, and ends with the wedding's consummation (leilat al-dokhla). Context: Arranged marriages still happen in the Arab world. The traditions of conservative Arab society and Islam forbid couples to have sex or socialize before marriage (however forced marriages are against Islamic teachings). Therefore, when it is time for a young man to get married, his family will look around to identify a number of potential brides. Arranged marriage is a tradition of Arab nations of West Asia and North Africa, but with the difference that between 17% to majority of all marriages in these countries are also consanguineous marriages. In Saudi Arabia, majority (65%+) of all marriages are endogamous and consanguineous arranged marriages. More than 40% of all marriages are endogamous and consanguineous in Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Sudan, Libya and Mauritania; and over 1 in 5 marriages in Egypt and Algeria. Among these Arab people, arranged marriages include endogamous and non-consanguineous marriages, and therefore exceed the above observed rates of endogamous and consanguineous marriages. Arab Christians such as Coptic Christians in Egypt. Marriage was a central feature of traditional Aboriginal societies. Freedom of marriage was restricted to ensure children were produced according to the correct family groups and affiliations and avoid marriages with certain close relatives or marriages with any one outside the group. Nevertheless, opinions vary on whether the phenomenon should be seen as exclusively based on Islamic practices as a 1992 study among Arabs in Jordan did not show significant differences between Christian Arabs or Muslim Arabs when comparing the occurrence of consanguinity. Traditionally, the process of investigation takes into consideration the girls' physical beauty, her behavior, her cleanliness, her education and finally her qualities as a housewife. In carrying out this traditional investigation parents also take the behaviour of the prospective bride's family into account. The first meeting usually takes place between the bride, groom, and their respective mothers. They meet, usually in a public place or in the bride's house, and get to know each other. The bride, groom, and their chaperones will typically sit separately, but within sight of each other, in order to get to know each other. Nowadays, the man might suggest to his family who he would like them to consider, and it may be that the man and the woman already know each other. It is also nowadays common in urban families for a bride and the groom to agree to marry before the groom approaches the bride's family for their permission. Question: Are arranged marriages still common in the Arab world? Answer:","completion":"Yes, arranged marriages are still common in the Arab world. In these marriages, the families of the bride and groom play a big role in choosing their life partners. Although some things have changed, like the bride and groom getting to know each other before marriage, arranged marriages continue to be an important tradition in many Arab countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

By learning about lots of sports, you are able to see what you like and dislike. Start a list of features from various sports that you want your sport to include. You might take the layout of a baseball field, the play features of bocce ball, and the penalties of football. Don’t take more than one or two features from each sport unless you want to create something that’s a variation of a sport that already exists. Write out how the game is played and how a winner is determined. Be as specific as possible about what each player or team must do and what they are not allowed to do. Decide if there is a time limit or if play goes on until a certain score or goal is reached. Decide if teams rotate turns or if play shifts back and forth between them at random. For example, in volleyball, each team serves at specific times, but play passes back and forth until one team misses the ball. In baseball, teams take turns being at bat and in the field. Many sports, like soccer, have a time limit and the winner is whoever has the most points. Others, like tennis, are played until a specific point value is reached. If you want the sport to require teams, decide if there must be a set number or if it can vary. On the other side, plan the sport differently if you want it to be a one-on-one game. Keep in mind that some of the most popular sports are adaptable for a range of players. Sports like soccer, basketball, ultimate frisbee, and football are designed to accommodate a range of player numbers. They typically require at least two people per team and up to ten or eleven, but the game can be played with any number in between. Games like ping pong, tennis, and racquetball require at least two and no more than four, in most cases. Set out what you think is the ideal number of players, but make note of how the game could be adapted for different numbers of players. Start broad, and expand outward into specifics. Make sure there are enough rules to make the sport work but not so many that it becomes confusing for players to learn it. For starters, set out five to ten basic rules. You might brainstorm lots of rules and then rank them in terms of importance. Go through a process of elimination to get rid of ones that are not necessary. Rules include what players must do, what they are allowed to do, and what they are not allowed to do. For example, players must walk, are allowed to jump, but can’t run. Incorporate various rules from sports that already exist, which you researched in the first stage of the sport’s development.","completion":"This article guides the reader through the process of creating a new sport by researching existing ones, combining their features, developing rules, determining player numbers, and ensuring adaptability for various player counts."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The violent response of Patricia to Lindsey's news indicated that Lindsey had said something she didn't like. This reaction from Patricia was unexpected and shocking to everyone in the room, as she was generally known to be level-headed and understanding. Patricia's emotions were heightened, as her clenched fists, furrowed brow, and reddened face signaled her frustration and anger towards Lindsey's revelation. Lindsey, on the other hand, was taken aback by Patricia's response, as she had not anticipated such a strong reaction. This immediately created a tense atmosphere, and everyone in the room felt the weight of the situation. The news that Lindsey had shared seemed to have triggered a deep-rooted issue or feeling that Patricia had been harboring, and now was forced to face head-on. Realizing the effect her words had on her dear friend, Lindsey quickly tried to explain herself and ease the tension. She stuttered and stammered, trying to find the right words to convey her perspective and to ensure that Patricia knew that her intentions were never malicious. As Lindsey’s voice quivered, it was evident that the last thing she wanted was to hurt Patricia or instigate such a hostile exchange. As all eyes remained on the two friends at the center of the conflict, it became vital for them to find a way to resolve their differences and understand each other's viewpoints.

Though it was clear that Lindsey had said something Patricia didn't like, uncovering the root of this emotional response would require both parties to engage in open and honest communication. It would be necessary for Patricia to express her feelings and explain the reason behind her reaction, while Lindsey should listen attentively and provide her own perspective on the matter. The situation was undeniably uncomfortable and difficult for everyone involved. Still, it was essential to find a way forward, as these two friends had a strong bond that deserved the chance to be mended.

In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion. and the situation: Jordan is conducting an experiment to see how Iron rusts. He first takes Iron Bar A and puts it out on his porch on a rainy day. Then he puts Iron bar B in an airtight bag and removes all of the oxygen and air to vacuum seal it. After some time passes the bar he left outside is completely covered in rust. He removes the bar in the vacuum sealed bag and to his surprise it has no rust at all. Because there was no oxygen and water in the air tight bag, iron bar B has no rust at all. Iron bar A was exposed to a lot of water and oxygen and there for it rusted completely.

An important new study into teenage attitudes surprisingly shows that their family life is more harmonious than it had ever been in the past. \\"We were surprised by just how positive today's young people seem to be about their families,\\" said one number of the research team. \\"They're expected to be rebellious and selfish but actually they have other things on their minds: they want a car and material goods, and they worry about whether school is serving them well. There's more negotiation and discussion between parents and children, and children expect to take part in the family decision-making process. They don't want to rock the boat.\\" So it seems that this generation of parents is much more likely than parents of 30 years ago to treat their children as friends. \\"My parents are happy to discuss things with me and willing to listen to me,\\" says 17-year-old Daniel Lazall. \\"I always tell them when I'm going out clubbing.

While flying a routine mission for the U.S. Navy from his aircraft carrier, an emergency causes Lieutenant Robin \\"Rob\\" Crusoe to eject from his F-8 Crusader into the ocean. Crusoe drifts on the ocean in an emergency life raft for several days and nights until landing on an uninhabited island. Crusoe builds a shelter for himself, fashions new clothing out of available materials, and begins to scout the island, discovering an abandoned Japanese submarine from World War II. Scouring the submarine, Crusoe also discovers a NASA astrochimp named Floyd, played by Dinky.Using tools and blueprints found in the submarine, Crusoe and Floyd construct a Japanese pavilion, a golf course, and a mail delivery system for sending bottles containing missives to his fiancee out to sea. Soon after, Crusoe finds that the island is not entirely uninhabited when he encounters a beautiful island girl, whom he names Wednesday. Wednesday recounts that due to her unwillingness to marry, her chieftain father, Tanamashuhi, plans to sacrifice her and her sisters to Kaboona, an immense effigy on the island with whom he pretends to communicate. The day Tanamashu arrives on the island, Crusoe uses paraphernalia from the submarine to combat him, culminating in the destruction of the Kaboona statue.

A stronger acid produces a greater concentration of ions than a weaker acid. If an acid is strong, it's concentration of ions will be increased or decreased.? A:","completion":"If an acid is strong, its concentration of ions will be increased. Justification: 1. When an acid dissolves in water, it donates protons (H+ ions) to the water molecules, producing hydronium ions (H3O+). This process is called ionization or dissociation. 2. Strong acids are completely or very nearly completely ionized in water. This means that each molecule of a strong acid becomes a hydronium ion (and an anion). Therefore, the concentration of ions in the solution is directly proportional to the concentration of the strong acid. 3. For example, if 1 mole of hydrochloric acid (HCl, a strong acid) is dissolved in water, it will produce 1 mole of hydronium ions (H3O+) and 1 mole of chloride ions (Cl-) giving a total of 2 moles of ions. 4. On the other hand, weak acids only partially ionize, meaning fewer ions are produced. Therefore, the concentration of ions in a solution of strong acid is higher compared to a weaker one. Hence, if an acid is strong, its concentration of ions will be increased."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Bradford Myatt knew that his father, Earl, had been distraught over the deteriorating health of his wife, but nothing could have prepared him for what happened Sunday. At approximately 1:37 p.m., Earl and Mary Myatt were struck and killed by a CSX freight train heading east at the crossover at Fox Road. A suicide note was found in the Oneida couple’s car that was parked alongside the tracks, and Earl called Bradford a couple of minutes prior to the incident to say “he was sorry for what he was about to do.” “He called me at 1:35, and at 1:37, they were dead,” said Bradford, 30. “We’re devastated … but I want everyone to know that my father was a good man, and my mother was an angel who would do anything for anybody.” Myatt said his mother, Mary, 59, was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm Jan. 20 and that her cognitive functions were like that of a toddler. He said his 59-year-old father was having a hard time dealing with it. “He was saddened by what she had been reduced to,” Bradford said. “He missed his wife.” Trooper Jack Keller, public information officer for State Police Troop D, said investigators still were conducting follow-up interviews Monday and putting together the accident reconstruction, which will indicate the speed the train was traveling and whether it tried to stop before hitting the couple, who had been married 42 years. “It appears they just picked a random location,” Keller said of the spot the Myatts were killed. “We have witnesses who said they heard a warning horn … but there is video that shows they stood right on the tracks waiting for it to come.” Earl and Mary Wyatt also left behind a 42-year-old son, Brian, and four grandchildren. Follow @OD_Vanno on Twitter or call him at 792-5074. ||||| Earl and Mary Myatt met at a party when they were 17. \\"It was one of those instant loves,\\" said their son, Brad Myatt, 30. His parents were married for 42 years. Their marriage and lives ended Sunday when they stood in the path of a CSX train in the Oneida County town of Verona. They were both 59. Earl and Mary Myatt, of Oneida, were hardworking parents who doted on their children and then their grandchildren. He loved to golf. She loved to fish and make sandcastles at Verona Beach. But their story is one where the complications of age and illness came early: Mary Myatt had a brain aneurysm in January, her son said. She spent a month in intensive care at Upstate University Hospital, Brad Myatt said. Mary Myatt had multiple surgeries on her skull. The last was two weeks ago, her son said. Mary Myatt wasn't the person she had been before the aneurysm. She would start a conversation and get lost. She didn't always understand what was happening around her. She struggled to use the bathroom on her own. She was frustrated, her son said. Mary Myatt was Earl Myatt's life. And her frustration was his, too, said their son. Brad Myatt said his father was devastated by his mother's illness and had become depressed. But he didn't sway from her side. The Myatts were working people. Both had jobs at Mohawk Valley Community College at the bookstore; Earl worked in Utica and Mary worked at the Rome campus. Earl Myatt would go to work at 3:30 a.m. when his wife was in the hospital in Syracuse so he could spend the rest of his day with her. And when she was moved to the Oneida Healthcare Extended Care Facility at the end of February, he would still go to work before dawn so he could spend the end of each day with his wife. Poll: Should New York revisit legalizing euthanasia? The couple's four grandkids weren't allowed at the Oneida facility, so Earl Myatt took Mary to visit them every Saturday and Sunday. First they would go to their older son Brian's house to see his son and daughter. Then they would go to Brad's house to see his two girls. Before her illness, Mary Myatt was the kind of grandma every kid wants. She'd beg to babysit. She'd have a tea party. She'd paint. She'd play in the snow. And she'd be happy because the kids were. \\"It was never about her,\\" Brad Myatt said. It was about the kids. And when he and his brother, Brian, were growing up, Mary Myatt's life - and Earl's too -- was about them. Mary and Earl would drive six hours to see one of the boys golf or play basketball for a fraction of that time. They were the parents that didn't miss a game. \\"We were spoiled in receiving two fantastic parents,\\" Brad Myatt said. He was the last person to talk to his parents. Earl Myatt called Brad Sunday afternoon. He put Mary Myatt on the phone. \\"I said, 'I'll see you soon,'\\" Brad recalled. He couldn't understand his mother's response, which wasn't uncommon. Then Earl Myatt got on the phone. \\"He just said he loved me and he was sorry,\\" Brad Myatt said. He knew something was wrong. He begged his father to tell him where he was, but Earl Myatt hung up. What Brad Myatt wants people to know, more than anything, was that his father was a good man who worked hard and asked for nothing in return. And Mary Myatt was Earl Myatt's everything. Earl Myatt wasn't acting rationally, his son said, but he was acting out of love for the woman who had been by his side for four decades. \\"She was his world,\\" Brad Myatt said. On Sunday, when Earl Myatt took his wife of 42 years to the train tracks, he wasn't himself, Brad Myatt said. He was a man who thought he was losing his everything. Brad Myatt has called to tell the train's driver how sorry he is for what happened. No one knows what Mary Myatt wanted. She could still lift her saucer at her grandkids' tea parties. But she needed help for even the simplest tasks of daily life. Her life, her son said, was about everyone else's joy. It was never about her. Earl and Mary Myatt, who fell in love at 17, left life the way they lived it: Together.

Where was the record for the longest professional match broken in 2010 when John Isner & Nicolas Mahut took 11 hours and 5 minutes over a three day period?","completion":"The record for the longest professional tennis match, which took 11 hours and 5 minutes over a three-day period in 2010, was broken at the Wimbledon Championships, held at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London, England. The match was between the American player John Isner and the French player Nicolas Mahut. It took place from 22nd to 24th June 2010 at one of the outside courts of Wimbledon, specifically Court 18. The match is often referred to as the \\"endless match\\" due to its extraordinary length. Wimbledon is one of the four annual Grand Slam tennis tournaments, and it is well known for its traditional and prestigious status in the world of tennis. The tournament is always played on outdoor grass courts, yielding a faster game compared to other surface types. Much of the Wimbledon tournament's legacy lies in its adherence to tradition, including the all-white dress code for players, and the fact that it continues to be the only Grand Slam tournament still played on grass. In terms of the match itself, it was a first-round Men's Singles match and it broke multiple records. Here are some of the significant facts about that game: 1. Total duration of the match: The match lasted for 11 hours and 5 minutes, which far exceeds the previous record for the longest match, which was a 2004 French Open match that extended to 6 hours and 33 minutes. 2. Final Set: The final set alone (the fifth set) lasted 8 hours and 11 minutes. Isner won the set 70-68. Unlike tennis matches at other Grand Slam tournaments, there is no tiebreak in the final set at Wimbledon. A player must win by two games, leading to potentially endless matches. 3. Number of games: The Isner-Mahut match consisted of a total of 183 games, shattering the previous record of a 112-game match in 1969. 4. Number of aces: Both players broke individual records for the most aces served in a match, with Isner hitting 113 and Mahut 103. This epic match ended with John Isner winning and moving to the second round. However, the achievement of both players in this historically lengthy match was recognized, and a plaque commemorating the match was placed at Court 18 of the Wimbledon Club.

Summarize this article: STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- NASA says there is a small chance an asteroid the size of the Empire State Building could hit Earth in 2135. NASA scientists say the asteroid, named Bennu, could slam into Earth in September 2135, destroying living things in the process. While the odds of the asteroid hitting Earth are one in 2,700, NASA has a plan if Bennu decides to go rogue. In an integrated study by NASA and the National Nuclear Security Administration, researchers have two realistic responses if Bennu comes too close to Earth. Bennu was selected for the case study because it is the best-studied of the known near-Earth objects. According to the study, NASA would use a spacecraft functioning as a kinetic impactor to deflect or push the asteroid out of Earth's orbit. In certain cases, NASA would set off a nuclear weapon. The plan is called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response, or HAMMER. NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has been on its way to Bennu for two years, according to the space agency. It is the first U.S. mission to collect a sample of an asteroid and return it to Earth to study. \\"Analyzing the sample will help scientists understand the early solar system, as well as the hazards and resources of near-Earth space,\\" NASA wrote on its website. The sample will allow scientists to study the asteroid which contain natural resources such as water, organics and metal. \\"Asteroids are remnants of the building blocks that formed the planets and enabled life. Future space exploration and economic development may rely on asteroids for these materials,\\" NASA wrote. FOLLOW ANNALISE KNUDSON ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER. ||||| This paper is part of an integrated study by NASA and the NNSA to quantitatively understand the response timeframe should a threatening Earth-impacting near-Earth object (NEO) be identified. The two realistic responses considered are the use of a spacecraft functioning as either a kinetic impactor or a nuclear explosive carrier to deflect the approaching NEO. The choice depends on the NEO size and mass, the available response time prior to Earth impact, and the various uncertainties. Whenever practical, the kinetic impactor is the preferred approach, but various factors, such as large uncertainties or short available response time, reduce the kinetic impactor's suitability and, ultimately, eliminate its sufficiency. Herein we examine response time and the activities that occur between the time when an NEO is recognized as being a sufficient threat to require a deflection and the time when the deflection impulse is applied to the NEO. To use a kinetic impactor for successful deflection of an NEO, it is essential to minimize the reaction time and maximize the time available for the impulse delivered to the NEO by the kinetic impactor to integrate forward in time to the eventual deflection of the NEO away from Earth impact. ||||| Here’s a tip for the planners among us: If you have dinner reservations or theater tickets for Sept. 22, 2135 (it’s a Thursday), now might be a good time to scuttle them. Sometime the day before, scientists say, there is a small chance that an asteroid the size of the Empire State Building will smack into Earth, destroying a lot of living things on the planet. But don’t worry. NASA has got you covered. Forward-thinking astrophysicists and people who specialize in blowing things up with nuclear weapons have come up with a plan, which they swear was not drawn up by Bruce Willis. If the asteroid — it is named Bennu — decides to go rogue, they could send a nearly nine-ton “bulk impactor” to push it out of Earth’s orbit. Or, more likely, they would gently nudge it out of its apocalyptic path using a nuclear device. The scheme is called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response. Or, for people who love acronyms and despise subtlety: HAMMER. Brent W. Barbee, the NASA aerospace engineer who helped author the study, insists that it is all theoretical. (His exact words: “Please don’t print that an asteroid is going to crash into Earth in The Washington Post.”) But using granular detail and eye-glazing amounts of math, the researchers believe they have a viable solution to a world-rattling what-if question. There is, of course, no massive mission to build a craft capable of playing a celestial game of space pool. The odds of Bennu actually hitting us are about 1 in 2,700. And the asteroid is not big enough to send us the way of the dinosaurs. But that doesn’t mean there is no practical application, Barbee told The Post. “We’re doing these design studies to prepare ourselves, so if we do find a threatening object, we’re better prepared to deal with it,” he said. Things from space smack into Earth all the time. Most of them are not existential threats, but some are large enough to cause injury or property damage. Generating a working framework to avoid an Earth impact could save lives. Until recently, the framework has basically been luck. In 1908, what many believe to be an asteroid crashed into an area near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in Siberia, according to the BBC. It struck with a force 185 times as powerful as the Hiroshima atomic bomb, flattened 80 million trees and reduced hundreds of reindeer to charred carcasses. A century later in 2013, a 10-ton, 49-foot-wide meteor streaked over Russia’s Ural Mountains at hypersonic speeds, shattering windows and injuring 1,100 people, Fox News reported. (Most were injured by shattered glass as they watched the meteor cross the daytime sky). The meteor broke up before it hit the ground but still left scars in nearby ice that were the length of a bus. The only reason more people weren’t killed or injured, Barbee told The Post, is because the objects struck places where there weren’t many people. [With a spacecraft in trouble and the White House watching, SpaceX had to deliver] NASA has a Planetary Defense Coordination Office that tries to detect dangerous asteroids and comets close to Earth’s orbit. There are more of these things than many people think, Barbee said. Researchers detect about 1,000 new objects each year; 10,000 extraterrestrial objects beelining for Earth could still be unaccounted for. The defense coordination office also comes up with plans for deflecting or destroying discovered objects. What Asteroid Bennu provides, besides pretty good fodder for a doomsday cult, is an opportunity for scientists to test those theories. Bennu is, the report says, a “well-studied roughly spherical body” that gives researchers a good target for their calculations — data points to punch into the algorithm. They can see Bennu with telescopes and track the impact its gravity has on other celestial objects. Soon we will know more. NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has been en route to Bennu for two years, according to the agency. It contains instruments that “will map Bennu and establish the composition of the asteroid, including the distribution of the elements, minerals and organic materials.” It will also scrape off a 2.1-ounce sample and bring it back to Earth, NASA says. If the odds are not in Earth’s favor, and Bennu becomes a bigger threat, OSIRIS-REx could be followed by a beefier craft that would break off a lot more.

There’s a team of Russian scientists zapping mini asteroids in their lab, and supposedly NASA is thinking about a plan that would hypothetically involve nuking Bennu should it threaten Earth in 2135. It’s true that NASA is drafting up ideas on how one might nuke an incoming asteroid, a theoretical plan called HAMMER, or the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response, as we’ve reported. But scientists probably won’t need to use such a response on the “Empire State Building-sized” asteroid 101955 Bennu, which is set to pass close to Earth in 2135. Diverting such a threat could be much, much easier. Advertisement “Even just painting the surface a different color on one half would change the thermal properties and change its orbit,” Michael Moreau, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx Flight Dynamics System Manager, told Gizmodo. That would involve literally sending a spacecraft to somehow change the color of some of the asteroid. There’s lots we don’t know about asteroids just yet, which is why NASA has sent the probe OSIRIS-REx toward Bennu. This mission aims to scoop up and return a sample of the rock in 2023. There is a minuscule chance, around 1 in 2,700 odds, that Bennu will strike Earth in 2135, reports the Washington Post. The rock isn’t big enough to end humanity, but it could cause some major damage. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will study the rock more, and NASA will continue to collect data to either rule out the chance of an impact or increase the odds. Advertisement But don’t worry about Bennu yet. Should the odds of a Bennu strike grow too high, the laws of physics will allow for a much easier solution than nuking. We could just splash it with some paint. The sun pelts everything in the solar system with a slew of tiny particles, for example. This imparts a little bit of pressure. These particles are of no consequence to our own orbit, since Earth is incredibly massive, but Bennu weighs only around 13 times the mass of the Great Pyramid of Giza. That’s very light, comparatively. Given the 120 years or so we’ve got and the amount of distance Bennu has left to travel before its nearby approach, if scientists could make some of it more susceptible to the solar radiation, that would slightly alter its path enough that it would miss us. Doing so would require changing part of its surface so it absorbs more radiation—for example, by covering one side of it with paint. Scientists first need to better study its orbit around the sun to determine the best course of action. All that is to say, as usual, we’re not about to be hit by the giant asteroid in the headlines. Advertisement There are asteroids we need to worry about, of course. But as we’ve reported before, we’re not tracking them. The government has only required that NASA track asteroids larger than a football field or so. Something smaller could go under the radar and cause significant local damage without the 120 years of warning Bennu has afforded us. The thought of nuking asteroids makes for great science fiction. But instead, you should spend more time upset that we don’t know what smaller asteroids are threatening us, rather than worry about the ones scientists are tracking that could be diverted more easily. ||||| Summary:","completion":"NASA says there is a small chance that an asteroid named Bennu, the size of the Empire State Building, could hit Earth in 2135.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of Smetana's first large-scale piece that is independent of words? ? Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before.

Dark Knight Rises Shooting in Aurora Puts the Colorado town on the map in a bad way Aurora has always been a town with a chip on its shoulder  something I say with love because it's my hometown. It's the biggest suburb in Colorado, but the fate of suburbs is to be overshadowed. The professional sports teams have Denver on their jerseys, the airport (though it is closer to Aurora) has Denver in its name. A former mayor once predicted that someday the region would be known as Aurora-Denver. You know, like Minneapolis-St. Paul, or Dallas-Fort Worth. Most people just rolled their eyes. (Read \\"Shooting Rampage at Dark Knight Rises Showing in Colo.; 12 Dead.\\") But today Aurora becomes an internationally known dateline. The shopping mall where I spent my mall rat years is on the world's television screens today, and a rapidly growing contingent of reporters is gathering at my high school a few hundred yards from a horrific murder scene. James Holmes, 24, walked into the midnight showing of the new Batman movie and wounded 71 people in a hail of bullets, at least 12 of them fatally. It's likely that the victims are of all races and shades, because Aurora is a melting pot. Forget that old image of lily-white suburbia, Wally and Eddie and the Beav. That was the Aurora of 1961, perhaps, the year I raised the rapidly growing population by one. We lived in a little cookie-cutter insta-house built by developer Sam Hoffman for the trolley-riding young working dads of a postwar boomtown. But today, Aurora is as diverse a city as you are likely to find: 60% white, according to the 2010 Census, 28% Hispanic, 16% black, 5% Asian. You notice that doesn't add up to 100. That's the beauty of diversity: more and more people don't fit neatly into a single category. Kids in the Aurora Public Schools come from 125 countries and speak more than 100 languages, according to the district website. The constant in that half-century of change is that Aurora has always been a working-class town, a place where communities aren't gated and most golf courses are open to the public. The average resident is a little younger than the Colorado average and the average household income is a little lower. It's a good place to start out. And a good place to find those middle-class working family folks that politicians are always talking about, though rarely actually talking to. Aurora is a swing city in a swing state, a place that voted for George W. Bush and for Barack Obama. When I was a kid the neighborhood Democrats held their precinct caucus at a house across the street from the neighborhood Republicans, and a significant proportion of both groups joked that they would prefer to caucus in lawn chairs halfway between the two. So you can bet that the president and his rival Mitt Romney will both take Aurora's present pain very seriously in very photogenic ways. Demography is different, however, from identity. Aurora's identity has long been its lack of one. As Gertrude Stein said of her hometown of Oakland, there is no there there. Aurora sprawls over a greater land mass than its famous neighbor, Denver, yet has no core. The original city center is now blighted, like so many inner-ring American suburbs, and development over the past half century has spread like water spilled on the floor. The current City Hall is across the street from the mall where the shooting occurred, but most people would get in their cars to make the trip. It's a low-slung place on the Western edge of the arid high plains; neither the trees nor the buildings get very tall. Cheaper to build sideways than up, because there is so much empty sideways available. The glamorous part of Colorado, the spectacular Rocky Mountains with their pricey ski resorts and private jet terminals, is a distant vision on the horizon. Perhaps it is fitting that the leading employer in this often ignored place is an industry that only whispers its name. Aurora's central location, high elevation, and clear prairie air long ago moved the Pentagon to locate classified and high-tech radar arrays on the edge of town. As a boy I would look from my bedroom window at the mysterious giant golf ball shapes and picture the Soviet missiles homing in on them. Aurora was certainly on the Kremlin's map during the Cold War. Since 9/11, that function has been expanded, and now the Buckley Air Force Base employs more than 12,000 people to monitor spy satellites and Predator drones and who knows what all secret business. Defense contractors like Raytheon and Northrup-Grumman employ thousands more. It's a shame that those extraordinary devices, which can see a man walking in the Yemeni desert or spy a campsite beside the Khyber Pass can't discern a deranged individual and his growing arsenal in time to prevent a massacre down the street. There would be more people alive in Aurora today, and fewer grieving families. And the overlooked city would still be largely unknown, which, we now see, is not so bad after all.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To investigate whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is crucial to understand the meaning of \\"entailment\\" and analyze the given statements (premise and hypothesis) to determine their logical relationship. Entailment, in logic, is a relation between statements, where the truth of one statement necessarily implies the truth of another. In other words, if a premise entails a hypothesis, then every time the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. It means that it would be impossible to have a true premise and a false hypothesis at the same time. Now let's analyze the given statements: Premise: White looked at me. This statement claims that a person (or entity), \\"White,\\" is looking at the speaker (me). Hypothesis: Black was looking at me. This statement presents a different person (or entity), \\"Black,\\" who is supposedly looking at the speaker (me). To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we must evaluate whether the truth of the premise necessarily guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, the premise and hypothesis refer to two different entities (White and Black) and their independent actions (looking at the speaker). The truth of the premise, \\"White looked at me,\\" provides no information regarding the actions of Black, making it possible for Black to either be looking at the speaker or not. Since we can imagine a situation where the premise is true (White looked at me) and the hypothesis is false (Black wasn't looking at me), we can conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. These two statements are independent of each other and do not offer any logically necessary connections between them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a summary based on this article: The range of the Saudi intervention is extraordinary as the unrest pushes Riyadh’s hand to forge what some commentators, in Egypt and elsewhere, brand a “counterrevolution.” Some Saudi and foreign analysts find the term too sweeping for the steps the Saudis have actually taken, though they appear unparalleled in the region and beyond as the kingdom reaches out to ally with non-Arab Muslim states as well. “I am sure that the Saudis do not like this revolutionary wave — they were really scared,” said Khalid Dakhil, a Saudi political analyst and columnist. “But they are realistic here.” In Egypt, where the revolution has already toppled a close Saudi ally in Hosni Mubarak, the Saudis are dispensing aid and mending ties in part to help head off a good showing by the Muslim Brotherhood in the coming parliamentary elections. The Saudis worry that an empowered Muslim Brotherhood could damage Saudi legitimacy by presenting a model of Islamic law different from the Wahhabi tradition of an absolute monarch. “If another model of Shariah says that you have to resist, this will create a deep difficulty,” said Abdulaziz Algasim, a Saudi lawyer. Photo Saudi officials are also concerned that Egypt’s foreign policy is shifting, with its outreach to the Islamist group Hamas and plans to restore ties with Iran. The Saudi monarch, King Abdullah, also retains a personal interest in protecting Mr. Mubarak, analysts believe. The Arab Spring began to unravel an alliance of so-called moderate Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which were willing to work closely with the United States and promote peace with Israel. American support for the Arab uprisings also strained relations, prompting Saudi Arabia to split from Washington on some issues while questioning its longstanding reliance on the United States to protect its interests. The strained Saudi posture toward Washington was outlined in a recent opinion article by Nawaf Obaid, a Saudi analyst, in The Washington Post that suggested Riyadh was ready to go it alone because the United States had become an “unreliable partner.” Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But that seems at least partly a display of Saudi pique, since the oil-for-military aid arrangement that has defined relations between the two for the past six decades is unlikely to be replaced soon. Saudi Arabia is negotiating to buy 60 billion in advanced American weapons, and President Obama, in his speech last week demanding that Middle Eastern autocrats bow to popular demands for democracy, noticeably did not mention Saudi Arabia. The Saudi ambassador, Adel al-Jubeir, sat prominently in the front row. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Saudi Arabia is taking each uprising in turn, without relying on a single blueprint. In Bahrain, it resorted to force, sending troops to crush a rebellion by Shiites because it feared the creation of a hostile government — a kind of Shiite Cuba — only about 20 miles from some of its main oil fields, one sympathetic to Iran, if not allied with it. It has deployed diplomacy in other uprisings, and remained on the fence in still others. It is also spending money, pledging 20 billion to help stabilize Bahrain and Oman, which has also faced protests. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia joined the coalition seeking to ease out President Ali Abdullah Saleh because it thinks the opposition might prove a more reliable, less unruly southern neighbor. But Arab diplomats noted that even the smallest Saudi gestures provided Mr. Saleh with excuses to stay, since he interpreted them as support. This month, for example, the Saudis sent in tanker trucks to help abate a gasoline shortage. On Syria, an initial statement of support by King Abdullah for President Bashar al-Assad has been followed by silence, along with occasional calls at Friday Prayer for God to support the protesters. That silence reflects a deep ambivalence, analysts said. The ruling Saudi family personally dislikes Mr. Assad — resenting his close ties with Iran and seeing Syria’s hand in the assassination of a former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, a Saudi ally. But they fear his overthrow will unleash sectarian violence without guaranteeing that Iranian influence will be diminished. In Libya, after helping push through an Arab League request for international intervention, Saudi Arabia sat out and left its neighbors, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to join the military coalition supporting the rebels. It has so far kept its distance publicly from Tunisia as well, although it gave refuge to its ousted president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. There are also suspicions that the kingdom is secretly providing money to extremist groups to hold back changes. Saudi officials deny that, although they concede private money may flow. In 1952, after toppling the Egyptian king, Gamal Abdel Nasser worked to destabilize all monarchs, inspiring a regicide in Iraq and eventually the overthrow of King Idris of Libya. Saudi Arabia was locked in confrontation with Egypt throughout the 1960s, and it is determined not to relive that period. “We are back to the 1950s and early 1960s, when the Saudis led the opposition to the revolutions at that time, the revolutions of Arabism,” said Mohammad F. al-Qahtani, a political activist in Riyadh. ||||| Dow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. As one of the world's leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. Her 2006 self-titled debut album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and spent the most weeks on the chart in the 2000s. The album's third single, \\"Our Song\\", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the success of pop crossover singles \\"Love Story\\" and \\"You Belong with Me\\", Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the US. The album won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest Album of the Year winner. Swift was the sole writer of her 2010 album, Speak Now. It debuted at number one in the United States and the single \\"Mean\\" won two Grammy Awards. Her fourth album, Red (2012), yielded the successful singles \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" and \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\". For her fifth album, the pop-focused 1989 (2014), she received three Grammys, and became the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice. Its singles \\"Shake It Off\\", \\"Blank Space\\", and \\"Bad Blood\\" reached number one in the US, Australia, and Canada. Swift's sixth album, Reputation (2017) and its lead single \\"Look What You Made Me Do\\" topped the UK and US charts; with the former, she became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the US. Swift is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 50 million albums—including 27.8 million in the US—and 150 million single downloads. As a songwriter, she has...

Build a movie plot around this: who is the leader of a faction of younger vampires? Frost Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Frost: Blood Reign\\" Plot: The movie opens with a scene of the dark, sprawling metropolis of Edgewood, plagued with escalating disputes between older, traditional vampire societies and a faction of defiant younger vampires. These younger vampires reject the old ways, thirsting for not just blood but power, freedom, and influence. Our protagonist, Frost, is the charismatic leader of this faction of young vampires, known as the Nightwalkers. He is known for his striking ice-cold blue eyes and hair as white as frost, hence his name. Frost is a fearless innovator who wishes to free his kind from the oppressive rules of the Sanguinary Council - a conservative governing board composed of ancient vampires who prefer hiding in shadows. Frost's faction all share his progressive views and are less inclined to hide from humans but learn to coexist with them. Frost's ultimate vision involves a world where vampires no longer survive in shadows but as equals to humans, a vision that incites anxiety and defiance among traditional vampires. The movie slowly reveals the backstory of Frost, who once belonged to the Sanguinary Council before witnessing their brutal treatment of Nightwalkers. Shaken by his past, Frost's charisma conceals a deep well of anguish and guilt. His only relief comes from his love interest, a human by the name Emily who's a brilliant and empathetic scientist striving to understand vampire biology in the hopes of peaceful coexistence. Conflict arises as the movie progresses. The Sanguinary Council grows intolerant of the Nightwalkers, fearing their audacious ideas will cause unnecessary attention from the human world, threatening their existence. An enigmatic character belonging to the Sanguinary Council's leader, Vladislav, starts orchestrating plans to eliminate Frost and the Nightwalkers. Meanwhile, Frost and Emily uncover a secret that could change the dynamics of their world – the existence of a genetic mutation that could essentially grant vampires immunity to sun and suppress their thirst for blood. Emily’s research paves the path for a potential harmony; however, this knowledge also places them under threat. As news of the mutation spreads, the Council becomes desperate, using all their resources to chase Emily and Frost, plunging their world into chaos. Frost must protect Emily and unify the Nightwalkers while seeking an alliance with fringe human factions who believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence. In a climactic showdown, Frost and Vladislav face off, highlighting the struggle between the new and old, change and stagnation. A thrilling battle sequence reveals not just Frost's courage, but also the strength and unity of the Nightwalkers. Meanwhile, Emily successfully implements the genetic mutation into a willing Nightwalker, proving it works. The movie ends with Frost winning the battle, assuming leadership over all vampire societies. With Emily's discovery, the path to coexistence for humans and vampires begins. ‘Frost: Blood Reign’ is a tale of rebirth and transformation, set in a world of darkness teetering on the cusp of unprecedented change. Fast-paced, packed with action and drama, it explores potent themes of societal progress, acceptance, and the cost of freedom."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But then that badger got caught in a trap again and at the end it's dying, too. \\" Jack said, \\"It was so sad that I almost cried. \\" I told him that many books have made me cry, beginning with Heidi, when I was just his age, right on up to the novel I finished last week. \\"Well,\\" he admitted then, \\"I actually did cry. Reading that book just reminded me of all the sadness in the world, and it made me feel sad ,too. \\" So, I think, now he has been through the sad tone of the passage , the discovery that words on a printed page can give rise to such strong emotion ,that a book can move you right out of your own comfortable little self and into someone else's pain. Thus we come to realize that if we are to remain fully engaged in life, open to its mysteries and feel sorry towards its suffering, we indeed need stories to grab us by the neck and remind us of the sadness in the world that is not our own.

Take the pad for your polishing wheel and get it wet using clean water. Wring it out so it remains damp, but not soaking wet. The pad must stay damp through the polishing process to avoid damaging your car’s paint. A dry pad will burn the clear coat on your car. Keep a bucket of clean water or a hose nearby throughout the polishing process. Put a moderate amount of polishing compound on the pad, then turn on the polishing wheel and press it into the paint of the vehicle. You may also apply the compound directly onto the body of the car, then bring the polisher to it. Read the instructions on the specific polishing compound you purchased, as some may have specific steps you’ll need to take for the best result. Once you finish one body panel, then move on to the next one. It is extremely important that you keep the polishing wheel parallel to whatever body panel you are currently polishing. Maintain an even amount of pressure over the wheel as you move it back and forth along the panel you are working on. Applying steady, constant pressure will reduce chances of damaging your paint. The polishing wheel will be spinning, so you need only move it back and forth. As you polish the paint on the vehicle, the polishing compound will swirl and smear, then slowly disappear, leaving only the brilliant shine of the paint behind. Once you can see the shiny paint, you can move on to the next area and continue polishing. Unlike waxing the vehicle, you do no not need to wait for the polish to dry. Don’t continue to polish shiny paint, as you may dull the finish. As you polish the vehicle, the polishing compound will begin to build up on the pad. Stop polishing occasionally to rinse the compound off of the pad, then wring the pad out again so it remains damp and fairly clean. Once too much polish compound on the pad it will compromise its polishing ability. Remember to keep the pad damp throughout the process. The edge of the pad on the polishing wheel moves the fastest and usually comes into contact with the least of the rubbing compound, so it poses the biggest risk of burning the clear coat on your paint. As a result, be extremely careful as you buff around trim components that may come into contact with the edges of the pad. Take your time and avoid pressing the edge of the pad into any part of the car’s paint. Be patient and rub polishing compound out of grooves the polishing wheel can’t reach.","completion":"The article provides a detailed guide on properly using a damp polishing wheel and polishing compound to polish a car, emphasizing the importance of maintaining even pressure, working on one body panel at a time, and regularly cleaning the pad to avoid damaging the vehicle's paint."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: How to smooth antique radio. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To smooth an antique radio, you should follow a careful and methodical approach to preserve the original aesthetics and value of the radio while improving its appearance. Here are the steps to do that: Step 1: Assess the condition - Carefully examine the radio to determine which parts need smoothing. Check for chips, scratches, rough edges, and other wear. Determine if the issue is with the wooden or plastic parts, as the approach will differ slightly for each material. Step 2: Gather necessary materials - For wooden radios, gather sandpaper (varying grit levels), wood filler or putty, wood stain that matches the original color, and a soft cloth. - For plastic radios, gather fine sandpaper, plastic polish, and a soft cloth. Step 3: Clean the radio - Before starting, ensure the radio is unplugged and turned off. Carefully clean the surface with a damp cloth to remove any dust or dirt. Step 4: Smoothing process For wooden radios: - Start by lightly sanding the rough or chipped areas with a higher grit sandpaper (around 120-grit) to even out the surface. Be careful not to remove too much of the original finish. - If necessary, fill in any small dents or scratches with wood filler or putty. Allow it to completely dry before proceeding. - Use progressively finer grit sandpaper (180, 220, 320-grit) to achieve a smooth finish. Always sand along the grain, and do not press too hard. - Wipe away any dust with a soft damp cloth, let it dry. - Use a matching wood stain on the smoothed areas, let it dry, and apply a second coat if necessary. For plastic radios: - Use fine-grit sandpaper (600-grit) to lightly sand the rough or scratched areas. Ensure you do this evenly and avoid being too aggressive with your sanding. - Polish the sanded area with a plastic polish to improve shine and clarity. Buff out the polish using a soft cloth. Step 5: Final inspection - Inspect your work to make sure the smoothing has been successful and that the overall appearance has improved. Be sure to keep the radio's original character by remaining as close as possible to the original finish. This step-by-step approach attempts to preserve the antique radio's originality while smoothing out any imperfections. Feel free to modify these steps based on your specific radio and personal preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Statement 1: \\"A large group of football players sitting on a field wearing red and white jerseys.\\" In this statement, we have the following observations: 1. There is a large group. 2. The individuals in the group are football players. 3. These football players are sitting on a field. 4. The field is most likely a football field since they are football players. 5. The football players are wearing red and white jerseys. Statement 2: \\"A large group of golfers stand together outside.\\" In this statement, we have the following observations: 1. There is a large group. 2. The individuals in the group are golfers. 3. These golfers are standing together. 4. The location of this group is unspecified, but they are outside. 5. No information about the clothing or attire of the golfers is provided. Now, let's compare the two statements, point by point: 1. Both statements involve a large group of individuals. 2. The activity the individuals are engaged in differs between the two statements. In Statement 1, the group consists of football players, while in Statement 2, the group is made up of golfers. The different sports require different skills and can be played in different settings. 3. The positions of the individuals in the groups are different. In Statement 1, the football players are sitting, while in Statement 2, the golfers are standing. 4. The location is more specific in Statement 1.

Write highlights for this article: It's hard to think about global warming when it's so cold that you can't suck in the air without pain. I stepped out on my porch in Vermont this morning -- I live in an old farmhouse with a panoramic view of the Green Mountains -- and could hardly breathe. The thermometer had dipped well below zero. I heard on the local radio that it was 70 below zero on Mount Washington, in New Hampshire, taking into account the wind chill. But I'm used to cold weather, having spent most of my adult life, almost four decades, in New Hampshire and Vermont. In fact, I remember the cold snaps of old, back in the 70s and early 80s, when for weeks on end the temperature would hover around zero, maybe creeping up to 10 or 15 at noon, when the sun looked like a pale and cheerless disc in the sky. There was a strange exhilaration in those sub-zero weeks: the sense of a vacuum, a silence that amounted to noise. You couldn't inhale, as it made your lungs ache. Your nose-hairs froze and breathing was difficult. Your glasses steamed up when you stepped into any building. It was important to dress in the most thoughtful ways, with layer upon layer of clothes, including a good set of silk underwear. Earmuffs were essential, as well as big fur hats, thick gloves, insulated boots and wool socks, the works. I have a photo that I love of the old poet, Robert Frost, in a winter hat with long earflaps, in heavy boots, a stick in hand. He is walking through a snowy field not far from where I live. He often wrote poems about being alone in the woods or fields in deep snow. I think, for instance, of \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\\" or the ferocious \\"Goodbye, and Keep Cold,\\" where he says: \\"Dread fifty above more than fifty below.\\" He's speaking to a stand of trees that seem not to mind the arctic weather, these resilient \\"Maples and birches and tamarack.\\" I'm afraid that human beings rarely like it when it gets so cold. Only a week ago, I paid a fleeting visit to Key West, Florida, where it was almost 90 under the palm trees. Coming back to Vermont late one night, only a few days ago, I stepped from the airplane into the dark, icy weather, and I wondered how I could stand it. When I got to my car, the thermometer on my dashboard told me it was 10 below zero. And the wind howled as I drove through the dark snowy mountains to my house. Was I crazy to live in such a climate? This morning I met a friend, an elderly Vermonter, in a cafe. He said to me, \\"I don't know about you, but I feel comforted by this cold snap. It reminds me of the old days, before global warming. I feel as if the world isn't completely out of whack.\\" I doubt the world isn't out of whack when, on Wednesday, it was colder in New York City than it was in part of Antarctica. This is imbalance on a global scale, and it doesn't provide much comfort to move through a brief cold snap. We know that vast shelves of ice are melting at the poles. We know that this past year was the hottest on record. Only those with their heads buried deep in the sand can believe that climate change is not upon us and that fossil fuels are not changing this planet in ways that will make life difficult for our children and their children. Something has to be done, and quickly, or we'll be passing along to our heirs a ghastly wreck of a planet. We will have proved dreadful and selfish stewards of this precious earth. I don't expect the cold to last, not like in the old days. Yet while it does, for a brief while, I plan to enjoy it. I'm going to bundle up tight today -- silk underwear, hat, gloves, and insulated boots -- and go for a walk in the woods, just to savor the depth of silence, the sense of a world brought to a point of absolute and unimaginable stillness. Like Frost, I will say to my Vermont neighbors with a wry smile: \\"Goodbye, and Keep Cold.\\" I know they will smile back. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jay Parini.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians. Question: \\"Who moved to Germany first: Abdelghani Mzoudi or Zakariya Essabar?\\" Response: \\"Abdelghani Mzoudi\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question.

Continue the following story. The math test was easy for Kevin but not Nick because","completion":"Nick had always struggled with mathematics. Even as a young child, he would get frustrated with simple arithmetic problems, much to the confusion of his family. Kevin, on the other hand, seemed to possess an innate ability to comprehend and manipulate numbers. The two boys had been best friends since kindergarten, but their diverging academic abilities created moments of tension and embarrassment for Nick. Over the years, Kevin had tried to help Nick better understand the subject. They would spend late nights reviewing formulas, equations, and complex problem-solving strategies. Despite Kevin's best efforts, however, Nick never made the progress he hoped to achieve. He continued to labor over math tests, often barely scraping by with a passing grade. The boys were now in their final year of high school, and they faced one last significant math exam: the dreaded calculus test that would determine their final grades and, in many ways, the trajectory of their academic futures. Kevin had spent the weeks leading up to the test in a state of calm confidence. He knew that he had the skills and knowledge to excel. Nick, however, spent his days in a fog of anxiety and despair. Desperate for help, Nick consulted their math teacher, Ms. Patel. She was an experienced educator who had seen her fair share of struggling students. She gently listened to Nick's concerns and offered her advice. She suggested that he try seeking help from a tutor or taking advantage of the after-school math club. Yet, Nick knew that he had tried all these tactics in prior years and found them of little benefit. As the day of the test approached, Nick's anxiety only grew. He couldn't shake the feeling that he would never measure up to his best friend, and he dreaded the moment when they would compare results. When the fateful day finally arrived, Nick sat down at his desk, the same knot in his chest he had come to expect each time he faced a math test. On the other hand, Kevin took to his seat with a sense of collected ease. He opened the test booklet and effortlessly moved from one problem to the next. The questions asked were well-aligned with the course material, and he felt comfortably challenged by the tasks before him. As he reached the end of the test, he couldn't help but feel confident in his performance. Meanwhile, Nick was struggling in his efforts to navigate through the questions. As he looked at the complex equations, his mind went blank. He could hardly recall any of the lessons he had worked tirelessly to understand. Kevin glanced over at Nick and quietly assessed his friend's situation. He never realized how much Nick truly struggled, and seeing his best friend wrestle with feelings of inferiority and frustration broke his heart. At that moment, Kevin made a decision. As he handed in his completed test, he asked Ms. Patel if he could be excused to the restroom. Once outside the classroom, Kevin sent Nick a text message, containing an offer of support during the remaining exam time. Nick gratefully accepted and found solace in knowing his friend was there for him - even if he couldn't change the outcome of the test. When the results came back, it was no surprise that Kevin received an outstanding grade. Nick managed to pass but only by the thinnest of margins. It wasn't the triumphant ending he had hoped for, but he couldn't help but feel a sense of relief that it was finally over. As they walked out of the school building, Nick turned to Kevin and expressed his gratitude for his unwavering support throughout their friendship. Kevin smiled and wrapped his arm around Nick's shoulders. \\"Remember, man,\\" Kevin said, \\"math is only one subject in the vast world of learning. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. I know you'll find your niche and excel in it.\\" Their lives continued to diverge as they embarked upon different paths after high school. Yet, despite their contrasting academic experiences, the bond they had forged through their shared struggles endured, only growing stronger as they faced the challenges and joys that life had in store for them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence.

Two engineersÂ â Aaron and AbeÂ â supplement their day-jobs with entrepreneurial tech projects, working out of Aaron's garage. During one such research effort, involving electromagnetic reduction of objects' weight, the two men accidentally discover an 'A-to-B' time loop side-effect; objects left in the weight-reducing field exhibit temporal anomalies, proceeding normally (from time 'A,' when the field was activated, to time 'B,' when the field is powered off), then backwards (from 'B' back to 'A'), in continuous A-then-B-then-A-then-B sequence, such that objects can leave the field in the present, or at some previous point.

The revelations about her relationship with the cabinet minister John Profumo hastened the end of the Macmillan government. The resulting scandal, involving allegations of espionage and prostitution, and a dramatic court case, saw her pilloried in the tabloid press. But Keeler was a somewhat naive victim of an establishment that was determined to protect its own position against what it saw as a tide of permissiveness. Christine Keeler was born in Uxbridge, west London, on 22 February 1942. Her father deserted the family while she was still a young child and her mother later set up home with Edward Huish, in a pair of converted railway carriages near Windsor. She was sexually abused as a teenager both by her mother's lover and his friends, for whom she babysat. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption She suffered an abusive childhood Keeler left school with no qualifications and had a succession of jobs, including working in a gown showroom and a spell as a waitress. She also posed for some modelling pictures. Platonic friendship At the age of 17 she became pregnant. Attempts at a self-induced abortion failed but the child, a boy, died days after the birth. \\"I was just 17, I did not have many illusions left, and the ones that did remain were soon to vanish.\\" Keeler found a job in Murray's, a Soho nightclub, where she served drinks and posed semi-naked on the stage. She also befriended another model, Mandy Rice-Davies. \\"When we weren't on stage, we were allowed to sit out with the audience for a hostess fee of £5,\\" she later wrote. By her own account she, like a number of the girls, had sexual relationships with the club's clients, although it was officially forbidden by the management. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Her relationship with Stephen Ward was platonic It was at Murray's that she met Stephen Ward, an osteopath who had a client list that included a number of rich and important people, including the former Conservative MP Viscount Astor. Keeler moved into Ward's flat although the couple maintained a platonic friendship. Ward took Keeler to parties where he introduced her to many of his friends including Peter Rachman, the notorious slum landlord, with whom she had a relationship. Ward and Keeler were also frequent attendees at weekend parties at the Astors' Cliveden estate in Buckinghamshire. Dismissed At one of these events, on 8 July 1961, Keeler, splashing in the swimming pool, caught the attention of John Profumo, then Secretary of State for War. Profumo, who was married to the actress Valerie Hobson, was seen as one of the government's rising stars. He kept in touch with Keeler and the pair had a brief affair. Also at the party was Eugene Ivanov, assistant naval attaché at the Soviet Embassy, who was friendly with Ward. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption John Profumo, here with his wife Valerie Hobson, was seen as a rising political star Keeler later claimed she had been sleeping with Ivanov at the same time as she was having an affair with Profumo, but many commentators have since dismissed her account. She had also been having relationships with two other men, Lucky Gordon and Johnny Edgecombe. Gordon and Edgecombe quarrelled bitterly over Keeler, resulting in Edgecombe firing shots at a flat where Keeler was hiding. The subsequent police investigation led the press to take an interest, and reporters soon learned of Keeler's relationship with Profumo. 'No impropriety' Suspicions that Keeler had obtained secrets from Profumo and passed them to Ivanov, led Labour to decide the whole matter was a security issue. With the press unwilling to risk a libel suit by publishing the story, Labour MP George Wigg used parliamentary privilege to accuse Profumo of having an affair with Keeler. Profumo was forced to come to the House where he denied having sexual relations with Keeler. Image copyright PA Image caption Stephen Ward was not destined to hear the verdict at his trial \\"Miss Keeler and I were on friendly terms,\\" he told fellow MPs. \\"There was no impropriety whatsoever in my acquaintanceship with Miss Keeler.\\" Meanwhile, Keeler had testified at the trial of Lucky Gordon, who she claimed had assaulted her. He was jailed for three years. On 5 June, Profumo resigned as Secretary of State for War, having admitted that he had lied to the House of Commons about his relationship with Keeler. Perjury Stephen Ward was arrested and accused of living on Keeler's immoral earnings. His trial began at the Old Bailey in July 1963. Image copyright PA Image caption Mandy Rice-Davies (l) was, with Keeler, a key witness in Ward's trial In what the writer Ludovic Kennedy described as a blatant miscarriage of justice, Ward was convicted following a devastating summing up by the trial judge. But, by the time the jury announced its verdict, Ward was in a coma, having taken an overdose of sleeping pills. He died in hospital three days later. In December 1963 Lucky Gordon's sentence was overturned by the Court of Appeal, and Keeler was accused of lying at his trial. She pleaded guilty to charges of perjury, and was sentenced to nine months in prison. Scandal Labour won the 1964 General Election, having used the Profumo affair to accuse the Conservatives of being unfit to govern. On her release from prison, Christine Keeler largely disappeared from the public eye. There were two marriages which did not last, but did produce two children. Image copyright PA Image caption She had little time for a fusty establishment Much of the money she had been paid by newspapers had disappeared by the 1970s. She published five books about her life, one of which, entitled Scandal, was the basis for the 1989 film of the same name, which starred Joanne Whalley as Keeler. As a young woman, Christine Keeler was desperate to get away from an unhappy home and make something of herself. She had little time for the fusty morals of a traditional establishment class. Unfortunately for her, that class was desperate to maintain its influence in a country about to experience the dawn of the huge social changes of the 1960s. That establishment was aided and abetted by a tabloid press, desperate to expose scandal, even where it didn't exist, just to maintain circulation. \\"They wanted to hear about the sex of course,\\" she once said bitterly. \\"But not the rest. No one wanted to hear the rest.\\" ||||| Christine Keeler, a London showgirl whose simultaneous relationships with British war secretary John Profumo and a Soviet military attache produced the country's most notorious political scandal of the 1960s, died Dec. 4 at a hospital in Farnborough, England. She was 75. Her son Seymour Platt announced the death on his Facebook page, noting that the cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The Profumo Affair, as it became known, has echoed through the years as one of the era's most lurid tabloid scandals, with hints of espionage, Cold War politics, class prejudice and sexual hypocrisy. The case has stayed in the popular imagination in the form of theatrical plays, including a musical by Andrew Lloyd-Webber, a feature film and dozens of books — three of which were written by Ms. Keeler. The Profumo Affair made the strikingly beautiful young woman from the British provinces a London celebrity and a perennial staple of headlines and gossip. A nude photograph of Ms. Keeler straddling a chair in 1963 became one of the decade's most famous images. She was often described as the call girl — a term she adamantly rejected — who brought down Britain's ruling Conservative government. Profumo, a rising political star who held the cabinet post of secretary of state for war, saw his career go down in flames. Christine Keeler in 1963. (Stf/AP) He and Ms. Keeler met in 1961, when she was taking a dip in a swimming pool at the estate of a British lord. He was 46, married and wearing a dinner jacket; she was 19, free-spirited and wearing a smile. They began an affair that lasted several months. At the same time, Ms. Keeler was seeing other men, including Yevgeny Ivanov, widely believed to be a Soviet spy. Profumo, who was married to film actress Valerie Hobson, tried to conceal his affair with Ms. Keeler. But in 1962, another of her jealous lovers, Johnny Edgecombe, opened fire on the front door of the house where Ms. Keeler was living. When she failed to appear as a witness at Edgecombe's trial, people began to wonder why. The full extent of the scandal came to light in 1963. After the press learned that Ms. Keeler was keeping company with a Soviet spy, there was concern that she had been wheedling state secrets from Profumo during pillow talk. She said she had to devise clever ploys to keep her romantic (and geopolitical) rivals from bumping into each other. 1 of 66 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Notable deaths in 2017 View Photos Remembering those who died in 2017.

The scandal also led to the 1963 resignation of Britain's Conservative prime minister, Harold Macmillan. \\"Christine was no spy,\\" her onetime lover, Edgecombe, said years later after he served a seven-year prison sentence. \\"She was far too scatterbrained. She was a party girl. A gorgeous-looking woman who liked men, liked sex and liked to be the center of attention.\\" Ms. Keeler and a friend, Mandy Rice-Davies, who died in 2014, acquired a cheeky kind of notoriety, known for their looks and their airy dismissal of stuffy social standards. When Lord Astor, the nobleman in whose swimming pool Ms. Keeler had been cavorting, denied that he was involved with the teenage Rice-Davies, she quipped in court, \\"Well, he would, wouldn't he?\\" Wherever she turned, Ms. Keeler found herself caught up in legal trouble. She was convicted of perjury in the assault trial of another of her onetime lovers, a man named Lucky Gordon. She found her connection to high society through a well-connected osteopath named Stephen Ward. In 1963, Ward went on trial for living off the \\"immoral earnings\\" of Ms. Keeler and Rice-Davies — a charge denied by all three. \\"This is a political revenge trial — someone had to be sacrificed, and that was me,\\" Ward said at the time. Near the end of the trial, he took an overdose of sleeping pills. He was found guilty, then died days later without regaining consciousness. The story of Profumo, Ward and Ms. Keeler was portrayed in director Michael Caton-Jones's 1989 film \\"Scandal,\\" in which Ms. Keeler was played by Joanne Whalley. \\"You talk to Christine, and it all happened the day before yesterday,\\" the film's screenwriter, Michael Thomas, told the New York Times. \\"She says Ward's the only man she ever loved, and you believe her. It's a love story between two people who were the weapons of each other's destruction.\\" Christine Margaret Keeler was born Feb. 22, 1942, in Uxbridge, England. Her father left the family when she was young, and she grew up with her mother and stepfather in an abandoned railroad car in rural Berkshire, England. She lived in such fear of her stepfather, she said, that she kept a knife under her pillow. She left home for London when she was 15. Over the years, she said she had liaisons with the Beatles' Ringo Starr and actors Warren Beatty, Peter Lawford and George Peppard. Ms. Keeler co-wrote three autobiographical books and had two brief marriages, to James Levermore and Anthony Platt. Survivors include a son from each marriage and a granddaughter. Profumo, once considered a potential candidate for British prime minister, reconciled with his wife and quietly worked on behalf of the poor and downtrodden. He died in 2006. In her later years, Ms. Keeler lived in poverty. She adopted the name of C.M. Sloane as she struggled to find work in advertising, in a school cafeteria and as a receptionist. \\"I mean, it's been a misery for me, living with Christine Keeler,\\" she told Britain's Observer newspaper in 2001. \\"Even a criminal has the right to a new life, but they made sure I did not have that. They just didn't stop calling me a prostitute for ever and ever and ever and ever. How can anyone live with that?

Told that her alleged former lover denied her allegations, she answered: “Well, he would, wouldn’t he?” Rice-Davies died of cancer aged 70 in 2014. Yevgeny Ivanov The Soviet naval attaché had an affair with Keeler at the same time as Profumo. The romantic triangle led to Profumo, then secretary of state for war, resigning. John Profumo The affair nearly destroyed Harold Macmillan’s government. Profumo spent the rest of his life volunteering at Toynbee Hall, a charity in east London. He died in 2006, aged 91. Written by Holly Watt Photograph: PA She had been ill for several months, and suffered from the lung disease COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). A major BBC series revisiting the scandal is due to start filming next year. Keeler, who had been living under the name of Sloane for many years, was briefly married twice, both marriages ending in divorce. She had two sons – James from her first marriage, and Seymour from her second – and a granddaughter. Platt, who lives in Ireland, said he, his wife and their daughter had last seen his mother a week ago. “There was a lot of good around Chris’s rather tragic life, because there was a family around her that loved her,” he said. “I think what happened to her back in the day was quite damaging.” Born in Uxbridge, Middlesex, and raised by her mother and stepfather, Keeler was working as a cabaret dancer in Soho in London when she met Stephen Ward, an osteopath, artist and “man about town”. Christine Keeler obituary Read more He introduced her to a party scene attended by aristocrats and VIPs, and through him, in 1961, she met both Profumo, then 46 and secretary of state for war, and the Russian military attache Yevgeny Ivanov, having affairs with both men. When the relationships came to light in 1963, amid fears of a cold war security leak, the scandal rocked the Harold Macmillan government. Profumo told the House of Commons there was no “impropriety” in their relationship after being asked about it by opposition MPs who voiced concerns about national security implications. Eventually, after more newspaper stories emerged, he admitted lying to the house, and resigned from the cabinet and the Commons. His fall from grace was deemed a contributory factor in the fall of the Macmillan government, with Labour winning under Harold Wilson in 1964. Keeler met Mandy Rice-Davies when they worked as dancers in Soho and both women were involved with Ward’s social set. Ward would later be convicted of living off immoral earnings, with Keeler and Rice-Davies as the main witnesses, but he took a fatal overdose before the jury returned their guilty verdict in August 1963. At the height of the Profumo affair, Keeler gave newspaper interviews and also posed for the now famous photograph of her sitting naked on a chair. Lewis Morley took the photo at the request of Peter Cook as publicity for a film. Photograph: Lewis Morley/Sloane The affair only came to light after an incident with Aloysius “Lucky” Gordon, a man whom Keeler’s family and friends said abused and stalked her. Shots were fired into the home of Ward, where Keeler was temporarily seeking refuge. When she was questioned during the subsequent police investigation, details of the affair became public. At the end of 1963, Keeler was sentenced to nine months in prison for perjury in a case brought against Gordon, where she accused him of assault. She spent six months in Holloway prison. Platt, a business analyst, said of his mother: “She was stalked [by Gordon] and didn’t really have anywhere to turn. It made her very vulnerable and extremely mistrusting of men. There weren’t a lot of male figures as I grew up because she wanted to protect me from men.” Platt said his mother was from a generation where there was “great shame” and she had felt it when she recalled her past. “But she shouldn’t have because, looking back, there was real good that came out of what happened. It did pull the curtain back, and there were changes in society that were needed.” The photo that launched a thousand poses: photographing Christine Keeler Read more He said she was a devoted, loving mother. “She was a good, decent person, and she got a very unfair label that was hard for her to live with.” But the press had vilified her, he said. “She was just a young girl having fun during the burgeoning of sexual liberation. She picked up labels, which I think were quite unfair.” She found her “notoriety” difficult, he said, and changed her name to Sloane in an attempt to gain anonymity. “Chris was feisty. And she would never shy away from a fight. She had a terrific sense of fairness. She would stand up against anybody she thought was doing the wrong thing. “And that is something I am very proud of. And hopefully, if there is one lesson I can learn from her, it would be that.” Desmond Banks, who had known Keeler since her 20s, and was her solicitor, said: “She was an extraordinary woman, much misunderstood, who deserves redemption.” The scandal had “overshadowed” her life, in particular the behaviour she suffered at the hands of Gordon, he said. “Had it not been for “Lucky” Gordon, Christine and indeed, Profumo’s affair with her, would never have been known.” He added: “I can’t think of anyone else who has had three musicals written about her, and several plays, and is seldom out of the news, for one reason or another. “She was the last survivor of a story that gripped Great Britain and the world more than 50 years ago.” • This article was amended on 5 December 2017 to amend some details about events relating to Aloysius “Lucky” Gordon. ||||| Solution:","completion":"Christine Keeler, the central figure in a 1960s scandal that rocked the British government, has died at the age of 75. In 1963, an affair between then 19-year-old Keeler, who was also involved with a Russian diplomat, and UK cabinet minister John Profumo ultimately led to the latter's resignation as Secretary of State for War. Profumo admitted lying to the House of Commons about the relationship. The scandal is seen as contributing to the fall of the government under Harold Macmillan and the Labour party's election under Harold Wilson in 1964."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon. Answer:","completion":"In the New Kingdom, justice for both civil and criminal cases was dispensed by local councils of elders known as Kenbet for minor disputes, and the Great Kenbet for more serious cases, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided.

Sentence 2: The conclusions are that we are all perfect spiritual notions of one divine spirit and manifest the spirit , not a material body . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"While these two sentences may appear similar at a glance, they convey slightly different information, primarily due to the choice of words and the specific phrasing used. Here, I will elaborate on the differences and similarities between the two sentences. Sentence 1: \\"The conclusions are that we are all manifestations of one perfect spiritual spirit and of the divine mind, not a material body.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the idea that we are all manifestations (or expressions) of one \\"perfect spiritual spirit\\" and \\"the divine mind.\\" This suggests a strong connection between the spiritual spirit and the divine mind, implying that they are not separate entities but two facets of the same reality. The sentence emphasizes that our essence is not found in our material bodies but rather in this higher spiritual realm. Sentence 2: \\"The conclusions are that we are all perfect spiritual notions of one divine spirit and manifest the spirit, not a material body.\\" In this sentence, the primary focus is on the concept that we are all \\"perfect spiritual notions\\" of one divine spirit. The phrase \\"perfect spiritual notions\\" indicates that our true selves are idealized and potentially abstract spiritual concepts associated with the divine spirit. The sentence also states that we \\"manifest the spirit,\\" creating a more direct connection between our spiritual essence and the divine spirit. Despite the differences, both sentences share a common theme in emphasizing the spiritual over the material aspect of existence. They both reject the idea that our essence is found in our material bodies and propose that our true nature is deeply connected to a greater spiritual reality. In summary, while these two sentences convey similar overarching ideas, they present nuanced differences in how our connection to the divine spirit and spiritual essence are characterized. Sentence 1 focuses on the connection between the spiritual spirit and the divine mind, highlighting that we are manifestations of this union. Sentence 2, on the other hand, emphasizes the concept that we are all perfect spiritual notions associated with a single divine spirit and that we manifest this spirit."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the subject line for this email? Carol, Hope things have calmed down for you this week. We are looking at Enron's proposed master netting agreement that Sara Shackleton sent to Beth Ng last week. We should be able to send her comments on that shortly. Also, we would like to get your comments on our form cover sheet to the EEI master, which McDermott, Will & Emery has sent to you on our behalf. Meanwhile, we would like to explore additional means to manage our credit risk to each other, particularly in light of the multiple affiliated parties in which we each trade. As we discussed last week, one way to do so is to do a series of trades that would result in the close-out of existing positions, corresponding settlement payments, and the reestablishment of the positions through new trades at market. A startegy such as the following would probably require implementation by means of numerous trades. Although the proposed strategy will result in cash payments, one goal of the proposed strategy is for the two group of companies to remain cash neutral. Here is an example of how the strategy would work: Assume (These exposures are purely hypothetical and are not intended to represent the values of transactions between Morgan Stanley and Enron entities): 1)A) Based on Swaps and cash settled Options, MSCGI has exposure (before collateral) to ENAC in the amount of 40 MM, ENAC's threshold is 5 MM and MSCGI is holding collateral in the amount of 35 MM, for an exposure net of Collateral of 5 MM. B) Based on UK Gas, UK Electricity, German Electricity trades, ECTRL in London has exposure to MSCGI in the amount of 10 MM. 2) ENAC and MSCGI agree to: (i) book out certain Swaps and Options resulting in ENAC paying 10 MM to MSCGI; (ii) reestablish those positions through new trades at market; and (iii) amend the ENAC/MSCGI CSA to provide that notwithstanding the mark-to-market Exposure of all outstanding Swaps and Options, MSCGI is entitled to hold 10 MM of the existing Collateral as a separate Independent Amount. 3) MSCGI and ECTRL book-out all of the existing UK Gas, UK Electricity, German Electricity trades, resulting in MSCGI paying 10 MM to ECTRL. MSCGI and ECTRL reestablish the UK Gas, UK Electricity, German Electricity positions through new trades at market. After all of these trades and amendments are completed, the status of the parties are as follows: A) MSCGI has exposure (before collateral) to ENAC in the amount of 40 MM - 10 MM = 30 MM. ENAC's threshold is still 5 MM. MSCGI continues to hold collateral in the amount of 35 MM (the new Independent Amount of 10 MM + the collateral of 25 MM for the new required Exposure, i.e., 25 MM = 30 MM - 5 MM). MSCGI's exposure to ENAC net of Collateral = of 5 MMNAC owes MSCGI 145.0 MM (before 140 MM of cash collateral) on Electricity Forwards, Options and settled trades (for an exposure net of collateral equal to 5.0 MM); and B) MSCGI owes ECTRL 0 MM on UK Gas, UK Electricity, German Electricity and settled trades. The amendment to the CSA described in (2)(iii) above is required. Otherwise, the new exposure before collateral would be 40 MM - 10 MM = 30 MM. With collateral previously posted equal to 35 MM, ENAC might request that MSCGI return collateral equal to 10 MM. Without the Independent Amount of 10 MM, ENAC's Required Collateral would equal 30 MM - 5 MM = 25 MM. If MSCGI were required to return the 10 MM as a result of these trades, it would defeat the purpose of the proposed strategy being cash neutral. Thus, to stay cash neutral, this proposal only works to the extent that it is possible to amend the ENAC/MSCGI CSA to create this right of MSCGI to hold collateral as an Independent Amount at least equal to the amount that MSCGI must pay ECTRL under the booked-out UK Gas, UK Electricity and German Electricity trades. Alternatively, it would work in any cases where the trading relationships between MS and Enron entities do not currently have either party posting collateral to the other, since we can take a similar approach to take advantage of potentially opposite exposures involving other MS and Enron commodities trading relationships.

Why isn't the PM of India (Modi) paying any attention towards OROP despite the protest of the servicemen in India? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"No, the two questions you asked do not carry the same meaning, though they are related. They both touch on issues of visibility, or lack thereof, on certain public matters in India. However, they focus on different perspectives and scopes. The first question is asking about why multiple forms of public civil action such as strikes, rallies, and protest movements, as well as judicial confrontations - which are a significant part of a democratic society's functioning - do not receive media attention in India. It implies a concern about the alleged absence of media coverage or the perceived biased reporting of such events in the country. There might be several reasons for this purported phenomenon, which largely depend on the particularities of the Indian media landscape and political climate. Possible explanations could include media biases, governmental influence on the media, the power of corporate interests, journalistic self-censorship due to fear of retaliatory actions, or the concentration of media ownership. Note that these are speculative points, as without a detailed study it would be hard to confirm what's actually happening. The second question primarily focuses on a specific issue - the non-implementation or overlooked issues of One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite the protests from servicemen. OROP is a long-standing demand from the military community, advocating for the same pension, for same rank, for same length of service, irrespective of the date of retirement. While this question too deals with the invisibility theme, its scope is narrower than the first question, specifically focusing on a particular legislative matter and the Prime Minister's role. The difference between the two questions can perhaps best be illustrated like this: the first question is casting a wide net, looking at the general landscape of protests, strikes, and other demonstrations of civil unrest, along with the role of media. It could involve everything from the farmers' protests to the strikes for better pay. The second question, on the other hand, uses a laser focus on one issue - the government's response (or lack thereof) to demands for implementing OROP. Therefore, while they both touch on issues of visibility in public affairs, these two questions are distinct in their meaning, scope, and implications. The first examines the issue from a broader societal and media-centric point of view, while the second delves into the specifics of a particular political and legislative issue and the role and responsibility of the country's supreme leader in addressing it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyzing the initial statement: \\"girls jump rope in out pepper pepper old man wipes his brow.\\" This sentence seems to describe a scene in which girls are jumping rope while playing a game involving the words \\"in\\" and \\"out\\" and repeating the word \\"pepper\\". Additionally, an old man is present, observing the girls and wiping his brow, possibly due to heat or exertion. 2.

When she arrived at the scene, the horrified mother began screaming at the mountain lion until it dropped her young daughter. \\"[Kera] picked Kelsi up and she was bleeding and there were puncture wounds on her belly,\\" Israel says. \\"From the neck down she is severely bruised.\\" He adds, \\"We are so blessed she survived this. There are angels out there watching over us.\\" \\"She's just really tired right now,\\" Israel Butt says of his daughter Kelsi (pictured) after being attacked on Friday by a mountain lion Israel says wife Kera actually saw the mountain lion earlier in the day. \\"We were eating dinner and my wife looked off into the distance and said, 'I just saw a cat run by! A big cat!' \\" he recalls. \\"And we were sort of like, 'No way! You're crazy!' And just went back to eating our dinner.\\" But shortly after that, Kelsi was attacked. \\"We rushed her to the emergency room, she is fine but doctors are worried about the bites becoming infected because cats are so filthy and those bite marks can become really infected,\\" says Israel. \\"She's on antibiotics and they've given her rabies shots as well, it's protocol.\\" The mountain line (pictured here) was forced into a tree by officials where it was killed Early Saturday morning the Idaho Fish and Game Department tracked down the male mountain lion – using hounds to catch his scent – and \\"treed\\" the animal. \\"The animal was found a couple hundred yards from where the incident occurred, so they forced it into a tree and they dispatched it,\\" chief of communications at Idaho Fish and Game Miek Keckler tells PEOPLE. \\"This is a wild animal and when we have something like this occur we can't take any chances. We are very lucky that this little girl survived this.\\" \\"Any threat to public safety is always the top priority.\\" Keckler says that, \\"If it looks like a mountain lion is interested in you or is stalking you, then we advise people to make noise and get big.\\" \\"But always back away, slowly, from the situation,\\" he adds. \\"And if it attacks, we recommend to fight and if you're able to land a punch or two the cats will generally back off.\\" Kera and Israel Butt with their children Israel says Kelsi experienced initial shock after the incident but has since recovered – and seeing photos of the dead mountain lion taken by officials has helped her cope with the trauma. \\"The first night after it happened, she said, 'Dad, I'm scared! I'm having nightmares' \\" he says. \\"But then she went right to sleep. She says it felt like someone was running her over with a bike.\\" \\"I can't even begin to describe how thankful and lucky we are. We still have our little girl with us.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"A 4-year-old girl named Kelsi was at a family reunion near Green Canyon Hot Springs, Idaho, with her cousins when a mountain lion, which is a big wild cat, came out of some bushes and grabbed her.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Next question: the unit of energy used to quantify the amount of energy in food is?","completion":"The unit of energy used to quantify the amount of energy in food is called the calorie. Calorie is a widely-used metric to express the amount of energy derived from the consumption of food and beverages. One calorie is defined as the amount of energy necessary to increase the temperature of one kilogram of water by 1 degree Celsius (sometimes referred to as a kilocalorie in scientific contexts). However, in the realm of nutrition and food sciences, the term calorie is extensively employed and usually refers to the kilocalorie. The calorie content in food and beverages as a means of expressing energy values is of particular importance for various reasons. It is crucial in understanding the nutritional value of food, as the energy provided by a particular food item is vital for sustaining a healthy lifestyle. Consuming adequate calorie-rich food is essential for an individual to perform daily activities, maintain metabolic functions, and ensure overall well-being. Different nutrients supply varying amounts of energy per gram. Carbohydrates and proteins each provide about 4 calories per gram, while fats contribute approximately 9 calories per gram. Alcohols, though not essential nutrients, contribute around 7 calories per gram. The energy derived from these macronutrients support the myriad of bodily functions, including growth, maintenance, and repair. To sustain optimal health, individuals must strike a delicate balance between their caloric intake and energy expenditure. Caloric intake, or the number of calories consumed through food and beverages, must align with the energy requirements of an individual. The total energy expended is directly proportional to one's basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the energy necessary for maintaining base physiological functions. Additionally, an individual's level of physical activity, age, gender, and overall health contribute to the determination of one's daily caloric requirements. Understanding the calories in food empowers individuals to make better dietary choices. Consuming excessive calories can lead to weight gain and a plethora of health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, inadequate calorie intake can result in malnutrition, muscle wasting, and impaired immune function. By recognizing the impact of calories and monitoring caloric intake, individuals can optimize their energy balance, maintain a healthy weight, and reduce the risk of diet-related complications. In conclusion, the unit of energy used to quantify the amount of energy in food is the calorie. It plays a pivotal role in measuring the energy value of food for the purposes of maintaining an ideal energy balance, sustaining essential bodily functions, and preserving overall health. By meticulously managing caloric intake and expenditure, individuals can successfully promote a well-rounded, healthy lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

'I was expecting someone to come because Lukasz has left for Swansea and I wish him all the best. I knew someone would come in. I'm just going to do the same thing over again, I'm going to try my best in every game and every week in training. Hopefully that will be enough.' Szczesny, who played in Sunday's Emirates Cup defeat to Monaco, thinks the first-team squad are reaching the right level of fitness ahead of the new Premier League campaign. 'It would have been nice to win a cup that we play at home, but that's not what we talk about in pre-season,' he said. 'We want to prepare and make sure we are at our very best at the weekend [in the Community Shield] and then against Crystal Palace in [the Premier League]. 'Last year we had a long pre-season and we played a lot of games in Asia. This year is completely different but I think everyone is looking sharper every single day.'

How do you do this: How do you place snaps into leather?","completion":"To place snaps into leather, you need to follow a systematic step-by-step approach. Here's how you can do it: Step 1: Gather the necessary materials and tools To place snaps into leather, you will need: 1. Leather of your choice 2. Snap set (consisting of cap/socket and stud/post pieces) 3. Leather hole punch or awl 4. Snap setting tools (anvil and setter) 5. Rubber or rawhide mallet 6. Ruler or measuring tape 7. A soft, non-scratch surface (like a cutting mat or a piece of scrap leather) Step 2: Measure and mark the leather Using a ruler or measuring tape, measure the location where you want to place the snap. Mark the leather with a visible but removable mark, like a chalk or pencil dot. Step 3: Punch or create a hole in the leather Use a leather hole punch or awl to create a hole in the leather where you want to place the snap. The hole should be the same diameter as the snap post. Make sure you punch through the leather completely and cleanly. Step 4: Insert the cap and socket pieces Take the cap (the decorative part of the snap) and insert its post through the hole from the front (right) side of the leather. The cap should sit flush against the leather. Take the socket piece (the female part) and place it on the post, with the open side facing towards the cap. Step 5: Set the cap and socket Place the leather with the cap and socket on the snap setting anvil (a small metal piece designed for snap setting), aligning the cap with the concave part of the anvil. Place the setter tool over the socket and strike it with a rubber or rawhide mallet until the post of the cap is fully seated inside the socket. Check to ensure the cap and socket are firmly attached to each other and the leather. Step 6: Insert the stud and post pieces On the other corresponding piece of leather, create a hole as you did in step 3. Insert the post (the male part of the snap) through the hole from the back (wrong) side of the leather. Place the stud (the male counterpart of the socket) on the post with the open side facing the post. Step 7: Set the stud and post Place the leather with the stud and post on another snap setting anvil designed for the stud/post combination, aligning the post with the concave part of the anvil. Place the setter tool over the stud and strike it with the mallet until the post is fully seated inside the stud. Check to ensure the stud and post are firmly attached to each other and the leather. Step 8: Test the snap Finally, test the snap by connecting the cap/socket and stud/post parts together, ensuring they snap securely in place and can be unsnapped without coming apart unintentionally.

In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

White team warmed up before the race, but Blue team arrived with a bus late and didn't have time to warm up properly before the race. But I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Born in La Ceiba, Honduras to an American father and a mother of Spanish heritage, Stephen Wood Van Buren was orphaned at age ten and was sent to live with relatives in New Orleans, Louisiana. There he attended Warren Easton High School, and tried out for the football team originally as a sophomore, but did not make the team. Later that year he dropped out of high school and went to work in an iron foundry. He returned to high school two years later and made the team as an end his senior year. Context: Van Buren claimed his second rushing title in 1947, which was the first in a string of three straight. His 1,008 rushing yards broke the single-season record of 1,004 set by Beattie Feathers with the Chicago Bears in 1934. He was no longer returning punts for the team, as the role was taken over by halfback Bosh Pritchard, though he still returned kickoffs. His 95-yard kickoff return touchdown against the Washington Redskins in the first game of the season was again the longest kickoff return by any player that season, as well as the last kick return touchdown of his career. The Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers both finished the 1947 regular season atop the Eastern Conference with an 8-4 record, so the two teams met for a tiebreaker game to determine the conference champion. During the week before the game, the Steelers ran workouts concentrating on a means of stopping Van Buren's running. In the game, the Steelers' defensive line held Van Buren to 45 rushing yards and no rushing touchdowns, but he scored the game's first touchdown on a 15-yard reception from quarterback Tommy Thompson. The Eagles won with a 21-0 shutout, setting them up to face the Chicago Cardinals in the NFL Championship Game, the first championship game appearance in franchise history. Against the Cardinals' \\"Million Dollar Backfield\\", Van Buren was held in check, as the Eagles were defeated 28-21 in a back-and-forth contest. The 1948 season was the second straight that Van Buren led the league in carries, rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, and yards from scrimmage. In Week 3, in the first quarter against the New York Giants Van Buren scored his 39th career rushing touchdown, surpassing Ernie Nevers as the all-time leader. That game--a 45-0 shutout win--was the first in an eight-game winning streak for the Eagles in which they scored 275 points total and allowed 49. The team finished the regular season with the best record in the Eastern Division and were to meet the Chicago Cardinals again for the league championship. Question: Did he rush for more yards in 1948?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Stephen Van Buren rushed for more yards in 1948 than he did in 1947. In simple words, he ran with the ball longer and did a better job in 1948, helping his team have a great season."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They loved to sing songs together. They were so good at it that they decided to make music as a team. Their team is called Ward Thomas, just like their last name. This way, everyone knows they are sisters who sing together! Now, their favorite type of music is called \\"country music.\\" Country music is special because it tells stories about real life, like growing up, falling in love, and spending time with family. Catherine and Lizzy loved listening to country singers from a faraway place called America, and they wanted to bring that kind of music to their home in Britain. So they started singing songs with guitars, boots, and cowboy hats. Well, not really cowboy hats, but they still made their songs sound like country music! They wrote their own songs about their lives, their friends, and their beautiful home in the countryside. One day, someone heard them singing and thought they were really good. This person helped them make a magic disc called a \\"CD\\" that had their voices and music on it. The CD was called \\"From Where We Stand,\\" and it had 12 songs on it. People all around Britain started listening to it, and they loved it very much. Their music made people dance, laugh, and sometimes even cry. Their songs were about real feelings, experiences, and emotions. They even sang about important issues like being kind, strong, and happy. People all over the world started listening to their music, enjoying their beautiful voices, and learning their stories too. As more people listened to their country music, Catherine and Lizzy became known as the \\"Country Music Queens.\\" They traveled around the world, singing their songs and making people happy. They even made more CDs with new songs for everyone to enjoy. Today, Ward Thomas continues to make lovely country music. The sisters are very talented and hardworking, and they love to sing together just like when they were little girls.

Part #2: Determine the relationship between Head and Tail. Usage: When PersonX behaves like PersonY, the attribute mentioned in the Tail is \\"accepted\\". We need to identify if this attribute is a natural result of the Head event. Part #3: Identify whether the Tail describes PersonX's persona or attribute as perceived by others given the event in the Head. Usage: As the Head event states that PersonX behaves like PersonY, people might perceive PersonX as being accepted if PersonY is generally accepted. However, it is impossible to determine this since we don't know anything about PersonY. Part #4: Classify the answer into \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\".

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"Step 1: Water comes into contact with something made of iron The presence of water starts the rusting process. Step 2: The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid The mixture of water and carbon dioxide creates a weak acidic environment, contributing to the corrosion of the iron surface. Step 3: As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve The carbonic acid starts reacting with the iron, causing it to dissolve slowly, which paves the way for the formation of rust. Step 4: Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen In this step, water molecules break down into their constituent elements - hydrogen and oxygen. Oxygen plays a critical role in the formation of rust, while hydrogen plays a less significant role. Step 5: The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together The released oxygen now reacts with the dissolved iron, forming a bond between them. Step 6: They form iron oxide, which is rust The reaction between oxygen and dissolved iron results in the production of iron oxide, commonly known as rust. Perturbation Hypothesis: Suppose the iron is exposed to the air while wet, how will it affect MORE rust forming? When the iron is exposed to the air while wet, it provides a conducive environment for the rust formation process to accelerate. Since air contains moisture and carbon dioxide, the increased interaction between the wet iron surface and the air would intensify the formation of carbonic acid, further promoting the dissolution of iron. Moreover, the wet environment aids in the breakdown of more water molecules, thus providing a greater supply of oxygen, which reacts with the dissolved iron to produce more rust. In conclusion, the perturbation of having the iron exposed to the air while wet causes a direct effect on the rust formation process. It accelerates the formation of rust by promoting a more rapid reaction between the elements present on the iron surface and in the air, thereby resulting in more rust formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

The rapid spread of Facebook, which has more than 500 million users worldwide, has prompted concerns about its negative effects, but researchers at the University of Texas have reached a different conclusion. \\"Our findings suggest that Facebook is not replacing face-to-face interactions between friends, family and colleagues,\\" said S.Craig Watkins, an associate professor of radio, TV and film who headed the research team. \\"In fact, we believe there is sufficient evidence that social media afford opportunities for new expressions of friendship, intimacy and community.\\" The researchers questioned 900 college students and recent graduates about how and with whom they interact on Facebook. More than 60 percent of Facebook users said posting status updates was among the most popular activities, followed by 60 percent who wrote comments on their profile and 49 percent who posted messages and comments to friends. The researchers also found that although about the same number of men and women use Facebook, they do so in different ways. \\"There is a noteworthy difference in aims in how to use a tool like Facebook.We found that for women the content tends to be more affectionate, and (they) are especially interested in using it for connection,\\" said Watkins. \\"For men, it's more functional,\\" he added.

Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes. According to the above context, answer the following question. After the end of the this story, how does Putin feel toward Trump? Answer:","completion":"The text does not provide information on how Vladimir Putin feels toward Donald Trump after the events described in the story. It mainly focuses on the political turmoil surrounding Trump's administration and the implications for the mid-term elections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film begins with Detective Havenhurst driving with his partner Detective Vargas. They receive a call and drive to the scene of a murder. As they push their way through the crowd at the crime scene, they see Brad McCullam leaving with a coffee cup. Inside the house, the detectives find the body of Mrs. McCullam, Brad's mother, who has just been stabbed with an antique sword. At the scene are the neighbors and chief witnesses, Mrs. and Miss Roberts. The detectives soon realize that they had just seen the murderer leaving the scene. The Robertses tell the detectives that Brad was disturbed, and had changed when he went to Peru recently. In a flashback we see Brad in Peru preparing for a kayak trip on a raging river. Back to the present time, the police have learned that Brad has taken two hostages in the house across the street. The police surround the house, and Brad's fiancÃ©e Ingrid arrives. Ingrid talks to Havenhurst about Brad's trip to Peru, saying that Brad's friends all drowned on their kayak trip, which Brad had decided at the last minute not to take part in; he later claimed that the voice of God had told him to stay behind. Several more flashbacks follow of Brad and Ingrid in Brad's bedroom, talking with Mrs. McCullam, looking at nearby houses, having dinner. Back in the present, Brad demands pizza for himself and the hostages, along with a car for transportation to Mexico. In another flashback, we see Brad in rehearsals for a Greek tragedy directed by Lee Meyers. As the pizza is delivered to Brad, Lee arrives at the scene of the crime. Lee talks with Havenhurst about Brad, and we flash back to Lee and Brad visiting Uncle Ted's ostrich farm. Brad convinces Uncle Ted to give him the antique sword which would be used in the crime. Brad uses the sword in more rehearsals for the play, in which he plays the part of a man who kills his mother, who is played by his fiancÃ©e Ingrid.

Thousands and thousands of children have read this story, only to ask for it again and again. It has travelled the wide world over, and has been told in every country. Hans Christian Andersen, the author of \\"The Ugly Duckling,\\" was born in Denmark. If you look on a map, you will see this little country in northern Europe. There, in the little village of Odense, he spent his boyhood. His father and mother were very poor. The family lived in two little rooms near the top of a house, where his father worked as a shoemaker. On the roof was a box filled with earth. In this box his mother planted her vegetables. Little Hans loved to walk with his father in the woods, where he could pick wild flowers and hear the birds sing. His father read to him when his work was done, or told him stories. What his father did helped him open up a new world. Once, when Hans was still a child, he went into a wheat field with his mother and a number of children, to pick the rest wheat which the reapers had left in the field. While they were busy picking only a small amount of wheat for each of them, an angry bailiff came rushing into the field, armed with a whip . All ran, as fast as they could, away from the angry man. _ and the sharp stalks of the wheat plants which had been cut down, cut his feet so that he could not get away. Unafraid, the boy faced the angry man and his upraised whip. \\"How dare you hit me when you know God sees you?\\" he cried, looking fearlessly into the face of the angry bailiff. The whip came down, but not on little Hans. The bailiff admired the boy's courage, and praised him for it.

One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it.

By Daily Mail Reporter A police officer has appeared in court after it is alleged he used his Taser gun on a 10-year-old schoolboy who refused to clean his patrol car. Officer Chris Webb is accused of saying to the boy he would be shown 'what happens to people who do not listen to police' during the event at Tularosa Intermediate School in New Mexico. He is then reported to have fired the 50,000-volt weapon at the boy. Rachel Higgins, legal representative for the seven-stone boy, known only as RD, told Santa Fe County Court he had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder since the incident on May 4.","completion":"The shocking event has sparked outrage among the community, leading to a thorough investigation and a growing concern for the proper use of force by police officers when interacting with minors. Officer Webb's actions are now under close scrutiny as the case unfolds, revealing a deeper issue regarding the balance between enforcing the law and maintaining public safety. The trial, set to commence in the following weeks, will have significant implications on how law enforcement officials are expected to handle situations involving uncooperative children in the future, potentially leading to new policies and procedures in place to prevent such horrifying incidents from occurring in similar contexts. Meanwhile, the school officials are reviewing their collaboration with law enforcement and looking into additional training to ensure student safety and well-being. As the victim's family seeks justice for RD, the incident serves as a sobering reminder of the need for continuous education and improvement within our law enforcement agencies, emphasizing the critical importance of compassion, understanding, and restraint when working with vulnerable populations like children. The repercussions of this case will likely have a lasting impact on the way police officers interact with young individuals, prompting a much-needed dialogue in communities across the nation about the role of police and the consequences of excessive force. The anticipated outcome of this trial, as well as any potential disciplinary actions against Officer Webb, will undoubtedly set the tone for how similar cases will be adjudicated in the future, as society grapples with the complexities of law enforcement in an ever-changing, increasingly tense world."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The virus \\"Ebola\\" is named after the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That's where the virus was discovered in 1976. A person can only get Ebola through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, for example, sweat or spit. Additionally, the virus can get into your body through your eyes and mouth if those areas come into contact with something that contains the bodily fluids of an infected person. That's why health care workers are supposed to keep themselves completely covered while treating patients. The deadliest Ebola outbreak is spreading fast in Western Africa, taking over 900 lives so far. The health systems in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are severely lacking in resources, and health care workers may not have access to adequate protective clothing when working in rural clinics, where the proper protections are lacking. Since Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia share a border; it's easier for people to move from one country to another, increasing the risk for disease spread. For now, all doctors can do is treat the symptoms and provide supportive care like monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing while making sure the patients' fluids are supplied. Sometimes patients are given antibiotics to treat other possible infections. The hope is to make the patient pull through the infection so their immune system can eventually clear the virus. The people who survive Ebola have created enough antibodies to kill it. There are several promising drugs and vaccines in development, but since Ebola is less common--and research about it is not well funded -- there is no drug or vaccine that has been approved for use in humans. Many of the other drugs and vaccines have not yet been tested in humans. The WHO (World Health Organization) is meeting next week to discuss whether experimental treatments should be used during this outbreak. Question: Why have there been no cures used for Ebola in humans so far? - There are not enough drugs for the infected people. - Ebola is rare and its research money is lacking. - The people have enough antibodies to kill Ebola. - The WHO has decided not to use them.

Sentence 1: Rapper Eminem mentions Dr. Dre in his song Guilty Conscience , in which Dee Barnes is featured . Sentence 2: Rapper Eminem mentions Dr. Dre in his song Guilty Conscience , in which Dee Barnes occurs . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"While the two sentences share similarities and convey related information, they do not convey the exact same information due to the differences in the use of \\"featured\\" and \\"occurs.\\" Sentence 1: Rapper Eminem mentions Dr. Dre in his song Guilty Conscience, in which Dee Barnes is featured. In Sentence 1, the use of the word \\"featured\\" implies an active role for Dee Barnes in the song Guilty Conscience. To be \\"featured\\" on a track typically means that an artist is contributing in some capacity, such as providing vocals, lyrics, or production. This suggests that Dee Barnes is a collaborator or guest artist on the song and likely has a visible or audible presence, adding value through her own unique input. Sentence 2: Rapper Eminem mentions Dr. Dre in his song Guilty Conscience, in which Dee Barnes occurs. In Sentence 2, the use of the word \\"occurs\\" implies that Dee Barnes is mentioned or somehow involved in the song, but it is not clear in what capacity. To \\"occur\\" in a track could mean various things, such as being mentioned in the lyrics, alluded to through musical motifs, or connected to the work in a different way (e.g., as a part of the song's inspiration or backstory). The difference between being \\"featured\\" and merely \\"occurring\\" in a track could be significant depending on the context. In Sentence 1, the reader understands that Dee Barnes collaborates on the song, while in Sentence 2, it is not explicitly stated what role Dee Barnes plays in Guilty Conscience. In summary, the two sentences convey related information, as both mention Eminem, Dr. Dre, Guilty Conscience, and Dee Barnes. However, they do not convey the same information due to the difference in the language used to describe Dee Barnes' involvement in the song. Sentence 1 implies a more significant and active role for Dee Barnes, whereas Sentence 2 leaves her contribution or association with the track ambiguous."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

According to the novel, Thomas Blankenship is believed to be the real-life inspiration for the character of Huck Finn in Mark Twain's famous work, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Additionally, the paragraph mentions that Mark Twain is incorporated as a significant character within Shohola Falls, and the fictional reality aligns with the historical one. Based on the information provided, we can make an informed assumption that the hypothesis suggesting \\"Thomas Blankenship knew Mark Twain\\" is likely to be true. The fact that Thomas Blankenship is cited as the individual Mark Twain based Huck Finn upon implies that Twain must have known or interacted with Blankenship in some capacity during his life. Furthermore, the alignment of the fictional reality in Shohola Falls with the historical reality further supports the possibility of a connection between Thomas Blankenship and Mark Twain. It is important to clarify that the paragraph itself does not directly or indisputably confirm that Thomas Blankenship knew Mark Twain, but the logical inferences drawn from the provided information point toward the likelihood of this hypothesis being true.

Our journey began when Sylvia Robinson, a music executive, brought us together to form the Sugarhill Gang. Robinson, who was seeking to produce a hip-hop record, chose us - Michael \\"Wonder Mike\\" Wright, Guy \\"Master Gee\\" O'Brien, and Big Bank Hank, to be a part of this revolutionary project. Step 1: Getting the group together The first step was to get the three of us together, which Robinson did. She recognized our individual talents and believed that we would make a great team. We developed a camaraderie and were eager to work together to create something special in the music industry. Step 2: Writing the song The next step was to write the lyrics and music for \\"Rapper's Delight.\\" We wanted to showcase our unique style and bring a new sound to the world of music. The song was a mix of catchy verses, each of us taking turns to share our rapping talents. The lyrics were filled with fun expressions and innovative rhymes that instantly captured the attention of listeners. Step 3: Recording the song With the song written, we entered the recording studio to lay down the track. Being new to the recording process, we were both excited and nervous. We worked diligently to ensure the track sounded perfect, making several takes if needed. Our chemistry in the studio translated to the energetic and infectious vibe of the track. Step 4: Release and promotion Once the song was recorded, Robinson released it through her label, Sugar Hill Records. We promoted the single through performing live shows, radio interviews, and spreading the word about our unique sound. The people in the industry and the general public took notice, leading to the growing popularity of our single. Step 5: Achieving mainstream success \\"Rapper's Delight\\" took off, becoming the first rap song to reach the Top 40 on the U.S. Billboard charts. Our hard work and determination along with Robinson's vision and belief in us had paid off. We had truly made history by bringing hip-hop to the forefront of mainstream music and creating a pathway for future generations of hip-hop artists. In conclusion, the success of \\"Rapper's Delight\\" and the Sugarhill Gang can be attributed to the combined efforts of all the members, the faith and guidance of Sylvia Robinson, and our drive to make a mark in the world of music. We will forever be grateful for the legacy left by Big Bank Hank, and his contributions to the genre that has now become a global phenomenon.

Instead, it is clear that the Abbey of St. Colm is currently in a state of ruin. The Abbey of St. Colm was founded in the 12th century and named for St. Columba, a key figure in the introduction of Christianity to western Scotland 600 years earlier. Over the centuries, the Abbey might have experienced several events – natural disasters, conflict, or general neglect – that contributed to its current state of ruin. To further explore the history of the Abbey of St. Colm, one would need to look at historical records, documents, and other sources of information that could narrate the state of the abbey throughout history. By analyzing such information, one might discover periods when the structure was well-maintained, and conversely, periods of decay and disrepair. This will also provide a better understanding of the factors that contributed to the deterioration of the abbey. However, even with this additional information, it is important to note that describing the abbey as always being in excellent repair would be an exaggeration. Buildings, especially those dating back to the 12th century, typically require constant maintenance to sustain their structural integrity and a pristine appearance. In conclusion, considering that the Abbey of St. Colm is now in ruins, it would be incorrect to assume that it has always been in excellent repair. Further research into the history of the abbey by analyzing historical records, documents, and other sources would provide more insight into the varying conditions of the abbey throughout various periods. Even so, due to the challenges of maintaining the structure over such an extended time, it is reasonable to believe that the Abbey of St. Colm might not have been in excellent repair during its entire existence."},{"prompt":"Chris is working in a lab that handles radioactive materials.

As Cao Cao prepares his huge navy to invade southern China and destroy them both, geniuses like Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu devise a grand strategy.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the former prime minister who did not provide financial support for the leader of the Nimrod Expedition? is inside the article: Despite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's achievements after the Nimrod Expedition in 1907–1909, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain—\\"a bit of a floating gent\\". By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to..., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last name of the former prime minister who did not provide financial support for the leader of the Nimrod Expedition is Rosebery.

Therefore, the full name of this former Prime Minister is Lord Rosebery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Gigi [ZiZi] is a 1958 American musical-romance film directed by Vincente Minnelli processed using MGM's Metrocolor. The screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner is based on the 1944 novella of the same name by Colette. The film features songs with lyrics by Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe, arranged and conducted by Andre Previn. In 1991, Gigi was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". In late April, Freed and Minnelli and their respective entourages arrived in Paris. The weather had become unseasonably hot, and working in unair-conditioned hotel rooms was uncomfortable. Minnelli began scouting locations while Freed and Lerner discussed the still incomplete script. Lerner had taken liberties with Colette's novella; the character of Honore, nonexistent in the original book and very minor in the Loos play, was now a major figure. Gigi's mother, originally a significant character, was reduced to a few lines of dialogue delivered off-screen. Lerner also expanded the focus on Gigi's relationship with her grandmother. By mid-July, the composers had completed most of the score, but still were missing the title tune. Loewe was at the piano while Lerner was indisposed in the bathroom, and when the former began playing a melody the latter liked, he later recalled he jumped up, \\"[his] trousers still clinging to [his] ankles, and made his way to the living room. 'Play that again,' he said. And that melody ended up being the title song for Gigi.\\" In September, the cast and crew flew to California, where several interior scenes were filmed, among them the entire scene in Maxim's, which included a musical number by Jourdan. Lerner was unhappy with the look of the scene as it had been shot by Minnelli, and at considerable expense, the restaurant was recreated on a soundstage and the scene was reshot by director Charles Walters, since Minnelli was overseas working on a new project. The film title design uses the artwork of Sem's work from the Belle Epoque. Where did they film?","completion":"Gigi (1958) was filmed at various locations, primarily in Paris, France, and at MGM Studios in Culver City, California. In Paris, some of the most iconic and recognizable locations that were used for filming included the Bois de Boulogne, Avenue Montaigne, Château-Brissac, Place de la Concord, and the Palais de la Civilisation du Travail, among others. In addition to these outdoor locations, many of Paris' exquisite streets and neighborhoods provided the perfect backdrop for the romantic story. After the cast and crew completed filming in Paris, they flew to California in September to shoot several important interior scenes. These were filmed at the MGM Studios in Culver City. For example, the entire scene in Maxim's, a famous Parisian restaurant, was recreated on a soundstage at the studios. The initial version of this scene, which was directed by Vincente Minnelli, was reshot by director Charles Walters on the soundstage, as Alan Jay Lerner was not satisfied with its initial look. In summary, Gigi was filmed at a combination of beautiful, historical locations in Paris and at the MGM Studios in California, which allowed the film to capture the charm and grandeur of its Parisian setting while maintaining a high level of production control in the studio environment. This combination helped create a visually stunning and memorable film that has stood the test of time."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

To contour your lips, apply some highlighting powder along the top of your cupid's bow and a dab of bronzer just below your bottom lip. Blend well and apply some bright lipstick. These will make your head appear longer than it is wide, giving the illusion of a thinner face. Even a baseball cap that is higher than normal can help make your face look longer. When choosing earrings, go for ones that go past your jaw; this will draw attention away from the sides of your face. The more angular the earring is, the more will contrast with your face shape, making it appear thinner. If you are wearing your hair in an up-do, you can frame your face by wearing some long earrings. This will draw the eye downward, pulling attention away from the width of your face. Long necklaces will also give the illusion that your neck and face are longer. Necklaces that are too short will pull the eye upward and draw too much attention to the width of your face. If you do wear short necklaces and chokers, remember to frame your face by wearing your hair down or lettings your long bangs hang by your cheeks. Try to find something with a rectangular shape, but that still has rounded corners. Glasses that are wider than your face will make your face appear more narrow.

This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\". answer the following question: What is the name of the person who Mattheson claims was trimmed into other fashions by \\"the lofty schooling of opera\\"?

The word \\"radiant\\" is commonly associated with brightness, light, warmth, and happiness. It is often used to describe someone or something that is glowing, full of energy, or emitting a positive aura. In various contexts, it could refer to an individual's radiant personality, their glowing complexion, or even a beautifully lit environment. In the realm of emotions and feelings, the term \\"radiant\\" is particularly connected to positivity as it can imply a sense of joyfulness, cheerfulness, or optimism. People who are described as radiant are often seen as being optimistic and having a way of making others feel uplifted as well. The phrase could also signify a level of confidence, self-assurance, and inner contentment that is apparent in someone's demeanor, body language, or facial expressions. To further illustrate why \\"radiant\\" would be considered a positive sentiment, consider the following examples: 1. \\"Her radiant smile lit up the room, making everyone feel welcome and at ease.\\" 2. \\"The garden looked particularly radiant that morning with the sun shining brightly on the colorful flowers.\\" 3. \\"Despite the challenges she faced, her radiant positivity remained unwavering and inspired those around her.\\" In each of these examples, the word \\"radiant\\" conveys a positive quality, whether it's related to a person's disposition, the aesthetics of a place, or someone's ability to influence others positively.

The other directly attested Old Iranian dialects are the two forms of Avestan, which take their name from their use in the Avesta, the liturgical texts of indigenous Iranian religion that now goes by the name of Zoroastrianism but in the Avesta itself is simply known as vohu daena (later: behdin). The language of the Avesta is subdivided into two dialects, conventionally known as \\"Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan\\", and \\"Younger Avestan\\". These terms, which date to the 19th century, are slightly misleading since 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but also from a different geographic region. The Old Avestan dialect is very archaic, and at roughly the same stage of development as Rigvedic Sanskrit. On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as Old Persian, but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its \\"old\\" characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage. Unlike Old Persian, which has Middle Persian as its known successor, Avestan has no clearly identifiable Middle Iranian stage (the effect of Middle Iranian is indistinguishable from effects due to other causes). Why did old Persian retained its old characteristics long after the old Iranian languages (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Old Persian, along with Avestan, is an ancient Iranian language. As you mentioned, Avestan retained its old characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had evolved into their Middle Iranian stages. However, this phenomenon can be better understood in light of linguistic, historical, and cultural factors that influenced the preservation of these dialects. First, it is essential to note that Avestan was employed specifically as a liturgical and sacred language in the religious context of Zoroastrianism. Avestan's religious significance played a significant role in preserving its archaic features. Just like other religious languages (such as Latin in the Roman Catholic Church and Sanskrit in Hinduism), Avestan was used for rituals, hymns, and religious texts, which demanded a sense of stability and continuity in language usage. Moreover, Old Avestan and Younger Avestan were highly conservative in their nature, primarily due to their function in religious scriptures. Since the religious texts were considered to be sacred and divine, preserving these texts in their original form was seen as crucial to maintaining the intended meaning and symbolism. Thus, any significant alterations in language might have been discouraged and could have been regarded as disrespect or as introducingpotential inaccuracies, leading to misinterpretation. Furthermore, religious languages tend to be somewhat disconnected from everyday vernacular usage, which usually experiences greater linguistic change over time. Since the main function of Avestan was in religious contexts rather than daily conversations, the influence of day-to-day linguistic changes was relatively limited. The more isolated a language or dialect, the less likely it is to undergo substantial changes. Lastly, the historical and geographical context also played a role in Avestan's retention of archaic features. The Old Avestan dialect was from a different geographic region than Younger Avestan, and Old Persian. This regional isolation might have played a role in preserving more archaic language features in Old Avestan. In summary, several factors contributed to Avestan retaining its old characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had evolved into their Middle Iranian stages. The religious significance and role of Avestan as part of Zoroastrianism, its conservative nature, the relative isolation from everyday language usage, and historical and geographical influences all played a part in preserving the archaic features of Avestan."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Doctors are now dealing with the aftershocks. Just how dangerous is this exposure? That's the question physicians are being asked by parents who find a lead-polluted Elmo, of Dora. Millions of others toys, lunch boxes and pieces of jewelry manufactured in China have been recalled because they contain lead either in the paint that coats them or as a component of the plastic used to make the item more flexible. The lead content in some of the toys recalled this summer was 180 times the amount allowed by law. Some pieces of jewelry were almost 100% lead. Experts advise that the items do cause a risk and that doctors should urge parents to check the comprehensive lists of recalled products on the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Web site and return any appearing on those lists to the manufacturers. If exposure is suspected, a blood test is in order . Since there is no safe level of this universal element, the risk face by children for lead poisoning and its accompanying threat of learning disabilities and behavior problems is considerable.

Title: The Dark Knight's Dilemma Main Characters: 1. Batman (Bruce Wayne) 2. Commissioner Gordon 3. The Antagonist (The Chaos Bringer) 4. Secondary Characters (Alfred, Lucius Fox, Gotham City Police Department officers) Plot Overview: Act 1 (Introduction): - The movie starts with a series of mysterious killings taking place in Gotham City. These killings seem to be random but are connected by a single message left behind: \\"Chaos is Order.\\" - Batman and Commissioner Gordon are desperate to put an end to this killing spree. They work closely together, sharing information and resources to find the mastermind or group responsible for these murders. - While investigating, Batman realizes that the person behind the killings is an enigmatic and cunning mastermind, with the code name \\"The Chaos Bringer.\\" This antagonist thrives on causing chaos, fear, and uncertainty within the city. Act 2 (Conflict): - Batman and Gordon continue to investigate the killings, but they are struggling to find solid leads. The Chaos Bringer is always one step ahead of them, leaving them frustrated and demoralized. - Meanwhile, the public starts to lose faith in Batman and the Gotham City Police Department's ability to catch the killer. They begin to see Batman as a harbinger of chaos, rather than a symbol of hope and justice. - In order to restore public faith and end the killing spree, Batman devises a plan with Gordon that will hold one person responsible for the murders. Act 3 (Resolution): - Batman persuades Commissioner Gordon to hold himself responsible for the killing spree. He believes that by doing this, the public's focus will shift, and they will rally behind the police department once again. - Reluctantly, Gordon agrees to take the fall and claims responsibility for not catching The Chaos Bringer sooner. This causes Gordon to be placed on temporary leave, giving Batman time and freedom to chase down The Chaos Bringer without hindrance. - Batman ultimately cracks the case and apprehends The Chaos Bringer. With the real perpetrator now in custody, Gordon's name is cleared, and he resumes his position as the Commissioner. - Batman's persuasive move reminds the citizens of Gotham City that sometimes, sacrifices must be made for the greater good. The public's faith in Batman and the police department is restored, and they celebrate a city that has overcome the brink of chaos. In conclusion, Batman persuaded Commissioner Gordon to hold himself responsible for the killing spree in order to shift the public's focus and give them an opportunity to take down the real mastermind, The Chaos Bringer.

Article: LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Bumble Bee Foods has agreed to a workplace settlement that is being called the largest of its kind in Los Angeles County history. The settlement agreement requires Bumble Bee Foods LLC to pay 6 million for willfully violating worker safety rules, the largest known payout in a California criminal prosecution of workplace safety violations involving a single victim, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement. “This is the worst circumstances of death I have ever, ever witnessed,” said Deputy District Attorney Hoon Chun, who noted that he had tried more than 40 murder cases over two decades. “I think any person would prefer to be — if they had to die some way — would prefer to be shot or stabbed than to be slowly cooked in an oven. “ The canned tuna company and two of its Santa Fe Springs plant managers were charged in April in the 2012 death of 62-year-old Jose Melena, who was cooked to death after becoming trapped inside a steam oven. The settlement calls for Bumble Bee Foods to pay 3 million to replace the tuna ovens with new, automated ovens that will not require workers to step inside and 1.5 million in restitution to Melena’s family. The settlement does not prevent the Melena family from also suing the company or receiving workers’ compensation funds, Hoon said. “Certainly, nothing will bring back our dad, and our mom will not have her husband back, but much can be done to ensure this terrible accident does not happen again,” the family said in a statement. The company will also pay 750,000 into the District Attorney’s environmental enforcement fund and another 750,000 toward penalties and court costs. Bumble Bee and two plant managers – Saul Florez, the former safety manager, and Angel Rodriguez, the company’s director of plant operations – had been scheduled for a hearing in court Wednesday, the day the settlement was announced. Melena had been loading pallets of canned tuna into 35-foot-long ovens at the company’s Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012. When a supervisor noticed him missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker was turned off, cooled and opened. The agreement also requires Bumble Bee to implement enhanced safety measures, such as installing video cameras at their ovens to ensure safety compliance, providing training to managers and workers about safety rules and conducting safety audits of their plant equipment. The District Attorney’s Office said the sentence will not be formally imposed for 18 months. If at that time Bumble Bee has been found to comply with the terms of the settlement, the company will be allowed to plead guilty to willful failure to implement and maintain an effective safety program, a misdemeanor. Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, agreed to do 320 hours of community service, pay about 11,400 in fines and penalty assessments and take classes on lockout tagout and confined space rules. If found to be in compliance, Rodriguez will be allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor in 18 months, according to the District Attorney’s Office. Florez, 42, of Whittier, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a felony count of willfully violating lockout tagout rules and proximately causing Melena’s death and was sentenced to three years of formal probation. Florez was also ordered to complete 30 days of community labor, take classes on lockout tagout and confined spaces, and pay 19,000 in fines and penalty assessments. Florez will be eligible to have his felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor if found in compliance with the terms and conditions of his plea agreement in 18 months, District Attorney’s officials said. The two men had faced up to three years in prison and fines up to 250,000. The company had faced fines up to 1.5 million.

(Photo by Melissa Masatani) LOS ANGELES >> Bumble Bee Foods will pay 6 million in fines and restitution including 1.5 million to the family of the employee who was burned to death inside an industrial oven at the company’s Santa Fe Springs plant in October 2012, officials said Wednesday. Los Angeles County district attorney’s officials called the settlement the largest known workplace violation agreement ever. Bumble Bee Foods LLC, the company’s former safety manager Saul Florez, 42, of Whittier, and current director of plant operations Angel Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, were charged in April with three felony counts each in connection with the October 2012 death of 62-year-old employee Jose Melena of Wilmington. As part of the settlement, the company will pay 3 million to replace the plant’s outdated tuna ovens with automated ovens; pay 1.5 million in restitution to Melena’s family on top of any other compensation or payment; 750,000 to the district attorney’s environmental enforcement fund for investigating and prosecuting workplace safety; and 750,000 in fines and court fees. Rodriguez will serve 320 hours of community service, take two safety classes and pay 11,400 in fines and fees. After 18 months, both parties can plead guilty to a single misdemeanor count of willfully failing to maintain an effective safety program, according to Judge Michael E. Pastor at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in Los Angeles. Florez pleaded guilty to one count of willfully violating workplace safety rules causing a death and will serve three years felony probation, serve 30 days of community labor, take two safety classes and pay around 19,000 in penalties and fees. If Florez completes the terms of the plea, he can petition after 18 months to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor and serve unsupervised probation. “As far as we know in California, this is the first time that a safety manager has been convicted of a felony,” Consumer Protection Division Assistant Head Deputy Hoon Chun said. “And we hope that the message gets out there that you can’t just be a safety manager in name only.” Florez and Rodriguez faced a maximum sentence of three years in state prison and/or a 250,000 fine. The San Diego-based company faced a 1.5 million maximum fine. Melena’s family members, one of whom sat silently watching the proceedings, did not want to comment, Chun said. The family had retained a civil attorney, he said, but did not elaborate. The company called the 2012 incident a tragic accident. “While this resolution will help bring closure with the District Attorney’s Office, we will never forget the unfathomable loss of our colleague Jose Melena and we are committed to ensuring that employee safety remains a top priority at all our facilities,” according to a statement sent on behalf of Bumble Bee Foods. Advertisement Melena, a father of six and a six-year employee of the plant at 13100 Arctic Circle Drive, had been assigned to load a particular oven on the morning of his death and entered one of the 54-inch-by-36-foot industrial ovens to make a repair or an adjustment to a chain, according to the state safety regulator’s citation about the Oct. 11, 2012, incident. He left the pallet jack used to load tuna outside the oven and another employee assumed that Melena was in the bathroom, then started using the jack, the citation said. Employees began searching for Melena after a supervisor noticed the worker’s car was still in the parking lot and Melena’s body was found two hours later. A Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner’s autopsy determined Melena died from burns and an investigation was launched by the California Occupational Safety & Health Administration and the District Attorney’s Office. The Cal/OSHA investigation found that previous serious injuries at the tuna canning plant had gone unreported to the state agency. An employee had a finger amputated after it was caught in a chute on Oct. 23, 2011, and another employee suffered a fractured skull after falling from a forklift on June 28, 2011, Cal-OSHA officials previously said. ||||| The parents of a South Carolina teenager who was killed last month by police demanded Wednesday that law enforcement give them more information about their son's final moments. \\"We just want answers. We have no clue as to what happened,\\" said Angie Hammond, the mother of 19-year-old Zachary Hammond, who was shot in a Seneca Hardee's restaurant parking lot on July 26. Hammond was unarmed when Seneca Police Lt. Mark Tiller opened fire on him, shooting him twice. Police say Hammond was trying to run Tiller over. Along with her husband, Paul, Angie Hammond pleaded in a press conference for officers to release dash cam video of the fatal interaction \\"just so we can know what happened.\\" \\"Our son deserves that, and we deserve that as a family,\\" Paul Hammond told reporters. Also on Wednesday, officials announced that federal authorities will join the investigation, according to NBC affiliate WYFF. ||||| LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jose Melena was loading tons of tuna into industrial ovens at Bumble Bee Foods when any worker's worst nightmare occurred — he got trapped inside and the massive pressure cooker was turned on. Melena's grisly death in a 270-degree oven three years ago led to a 6 million agreement by Bumble Bee on Wednesday to settle criminal charges in what Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey said was the largest payout in a California workplace-violation death. The sum was four times greater than the maximum fines the company faced. \\"This is the worst circumstances of death I have ever, ever witnessed,\\" said Deputy District Attorney Hoon Chun, who noted that he had tried more than 40 murder cases over two decades. \\"I think any person would prefer to be — if they had to die some way — would prefer to be shot or stabbed than to be slowly cooked in an oven. \\" Melena, 62, perished at the seafood company's Santa Fe Springs plant after a co-worker mistakenly believed he was in the bathroom and loaded six tons of canned tuna into the oven after he had stepped inside. The company didn't have safety procedures that would have required the equipment be turned off with an employee inside or provide an escape route or a spotter to keep watch with a worker in a confined space, Hoon said. In a rare prosecution of a workplace fatality, Bumble Bee, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death. Each party reached a different plea agreement Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. Bumble Bee agreed to plead guilty in January 2017 to a misdemeanor of having willfully failed to provide an effective safety program. First, however, it must complete several safety measures that include spending 3 million to upgrade ovens so workers can't get trapped inside and providing worker training. Florez, 42, of Whittier was sentenced to three years of probation and will face fines and penalties of about 19,000 after pleading guilty to a single felony count of violating a workplace safety rule that caused a death. Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, agreed to plead guilty in 18 months to a misdemeanor and pay about 11,000 after he completes 320 hours of community service and worker safety courses. The two men had faced up to three years in prison and fines up to 250,000. The company had faced fines up to 1.5 million. Melena's family will receive 1.5 million under the settlement. It does not prevent them from also suing the company or receiving workers' compensation funds, Hoon said. \\"Certainly, nothing will bring back our dad, and our mom will not have her husband back, but much can be done to ensure this terrible accident does not happen again,\\" the family said in a statement. Melena, 62, had been loading pallets of canned tuna into 35-foot-long ovens at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012. When a supervisor noticed him missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker was turned off, cooled and opened. The San Diego-based company is appealing 74,000 in fines by the state's occupational safety agency for failing to properly assess employee danger. \\"We will never forget the unfathomable loss of our colleague Jose Melena and we are committed to ensuring that employee safety remains a top priority at all our facilities,\\" the company said in a statement.

Question: Think outside the box, whilst inside the box (studio): As this studio is about working with constraints, I thought i’d google ‘constraints in filmmaking’ and see what comes up. One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...

Spacemen 3 were an English alternative rock band, formed in 1982 in Rugby, Warwickshire by Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. Their music is known for its brand of \\"minimalistic psychedelia\\". Spacemen 3 had their first independent chart hits in 1987, gaining a cult following, and going on to have greater success towards the end of the decade. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. Most members of Spacemen 3 have continued to produce music and record either collaboratively or in solo projects. Peter Kember (alias 'Sonic Boom') has had a solo career releasing music under the monikers Spectrum and E.A.R., and has also done production work for MGMT, Panda Bear, Dean & Britta and The Flowers of Hell. Jason Pierce (alias 'J. Spaceman') remains the leader and creative force, and only constant member, of the alternative band Spiritualized who have achieved significant critical acclaim and commercial success. Both Kember and Pierce continue to perform some Spacemen 3 songs live (e.g. \\"Transparent Radiation\\", \\"Revolution\\", \\"Suicide\\", \\"Set Me Free\\", \\"Che\\" and \\"Let Me Down Gently\\" [Kember]; and \\"Take Me to the Other Side\\", \\"Walkin' with Jesus\\", \\"Amen\\" and \\"Lord Can You Hear Me?\\" [Pierce]). Will Carruthers, Jonny Mattock and Mark Refoy formed Spiritualized with Pierce in early 1990. Carruthers left the band after the first album in 1992; followed by Mattock and Refoy in 1994. Refoy then fronted Slipstream who released two albums. Refoy played guitar for the Pet Shop Boys on their live tour in 2007. Will Carruthers took a hiatus from the music industry after leaving Spiritualized; but subsequently has worked with Kember, recorded two solo albums as Freelovebabies, and has most recently toured with The Brian Jonestown Massacre. Carruthers, Mattock and Refoy have also collaborated on projects together. After leaving Spacemen 3 in 1988, both Pete Bain and Stewart Roswell ('Rosco') joined the neo-psychedelic band Darkside who released several albums. Following the end of Darkside, Bain formed 'Alphastone', and has assisted Kember on some of the latter's solo projects. As of 2010 he provides vocals and guitar in 'The Urgz'. Stewart Roswell (alias Sterling Roswell) released a solo album, The Psychedelic Ubik, in 2004. In the early 1990s, early Spacemen 3 drummer Natty Brooker played bass under the alias 'Mr Ugly' in Garage rock band 'The Guaranteed Ugly', with Gavin Wissen. They released two albums.

Help as much as you can. Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What did the Investiture Controversy start? Context: Monastic reform inspired change in the secular church. The ideals that it was based upon were brought to the papacy by Pope Leo IX (pope 1049–1054), and provided the ideology of the clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073–85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms. The dispute represents a significant stage in the creation of a papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities. It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors.

Silver town was sustainable and didn't use any fertilizers or pesticides, while Gold town did. But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. What is an answer for this question: Which town caused fewer decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water? A:","completion":"Given the information provided and considering the background, it becomes clear which town caused fewer decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water. Silver town is the town that produced its food in a sustainable way without using fertilizers or pesticides. This method of production prevents the runoff of chemicals and excessive nutrients such as nitrogen from entering bodies of water, thus preventing the excessive growth of algae. On the other hand, Gold town used fertilizers and pesticides in their food production, contributing to the eutrophication of water bodies and the creation of dead zones due to the overgrowth of algae as described in the background information.

Many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth, as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century, such as improved medicine (causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades) and communications technologies, were not available at any price at its beginning.

The paragraph describes a scenario where a sender, using a spoofed email address, is attempting to extort money from the recipient. The sender does this by claiming to have an associate who had planted a bomb in the recipient's building. Since the sender is mentioning the involvement of an associate, it implies the presence of at least two people working together in this scheme, which means the sender is not acting alone. The specific instances in the paragraph that support this conclusion include: 1. The mention of an \\"associate\\" - This signals collaboration or partnership between two or more people. In this case, it indicates the sender has someone else working with them to plant the bomb. 2. The use of \\"him\\" when referring to the associate - The use of a pronoun like \\"him\\" further emphasizes that there is another individual involved in this plan. The sender states that the only way to stop \\"him\\" from setting the bomb off is by making the ransom payment, clearly differentiating the roles of both individuals. Considering these pieces of information, it is accurate to conclude that the sender did not claim to act alone in this scenario. They clearly identified the involvement of another party in the plot and relied upon their collaboration to create a sense of urgency and fear for the recipient, which would potentially increase the likelihood of receiving the demanded ransom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He spoke of the shock and disbelief upon receiving the haunting news that his daughter Kayla, who was once a beacon of light and hope for many, had been killed. He recounted how the family received little information from the authorities during Kayla's 18 months of harrowing ISIS captivity, escalating their profound fear and helplessness. Carl shared how they lived moment by moment, always hoping and praying for a miracle that would bring their beloved daughter back home. Marsha Mueller, her voice trembling with emotion, joined her husband in narrating their heartbreaking story. She said the family struggled to come to terms with the abrupt end of a life bristling with promise and humanitarian work. Kayla, she said, had an unwavering commitment to alleviate human suffering, especially among Syrian refugees. Marsha told Savannah Guthrie how proud they were of their daughter's courage and her strong dedication to provide solace to suffering humanity. Their son Eric, too, spoke about his sister with a mix of immense sorrow and quiet pride. He expressed his hopes that his sister's sacrifice and story would invigorate others to research and understand the plight of Syrian refugees - the people his sister loved and served with unwavering dedication and compassion. Eric said, \\"My hope is that out of the dark tragedy of Kayla's death, light will emerge in the form of increased understanding and awareness about what is happening in Syria. She would have wanted us to continue her work and not just mourn her loss.\\" During the emotional interview, Carl Mueller revealed how the family was initially hopeful when Kayla was captured by ISIS in 2013. They clung on to the hope that Kayla would be released, despite the notoriously ruthless reputation of her captors. However, as weeks turned into months and then into a year and a half, they could not shake off the growing dread about her fate. The Mueller family conveyed their pain, strength, and courage during the heartbreaking interview. Despite their profound loss, they emphasized their daughter's life's work, her dedication to assisting the needy and less fortunate, and her valiant efforts to highlight the suffering of Syrian refugees. Their interview served as a sobering reminder of the great human cost of conflicts, a testament to the enduring empathy of service workers like Kayla, and a resounding appeal to the world to continue her mission of offering hope and assistance to the world's most desperate and downtrodden. Besides paying tribute to their late daughter, the Muellers seek to ensure that Kayla's legacy continues to resonate — advocating for a greater understanding of the Syrian crisis, promoting aid and assistance to those stricken by war, and echoing their daughter's courageous cry for compassion for the less fortunate. Their heart-wrenching story shows their resolve in trying to find some semblance of meaning in the tragic loss of their daughter by advocating for the causes she fiercely believed in."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence from the Quran in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.

Crumple the fabric up and tie it if you want a random pattern.\\"","completion":"Title: Unleashing Your Creativity with Tie-Dye Patterns Introduction: Tie-dyeing is a popular and fun activity that allows you to unleash your creativity on fabric, resulting in unique, colorful patterns. The possibilities of creating stunning designs are endless - from traditional spiral patterns to modern, random ones. In this article, we will explore four different tie-dyeing techniques that will help you achieve the desired pattern on your fabric. 1. Traditional Swirl Pattern The traditional swirl pattern, also known as the spiral pattern, is one of the most popular and easy-to-make designs in the world of tie-dyeing. To create this striking pattern, follow these steps: Step 1: Lay your fabric flat on a work surface. Step 2: Decide on the center point of your spiral. This will be the point where the swirl pattern starts and gradually extends outward. Step 3: Using your fingers, begin twisting the fabric around the center point, gradually moving outward until you have a spiral-shaped bundle of fabric. Step 4: Secure the twisted fabric using three or four rubber bands, ensuring each section is held together properly. Step 5: Apply the dye to the fabric by section, varying the colors as desired. Flip the fabric and repeat the dyeing process on the other side. By following these simple steps, you'll be able to create an eye-catching, traditional swirl pattern on your fabric. 2. Striped Pattern A striped pattern is a versatile design that can be used to create a simple or complex pattern depending on your preference. To achieve this: Step 1: Lay your fabric flat on the work surface. Step 2: Fold your fabric accordion-style, either horizontally or vertically depending on the direction of the stripes you want. Step 3: Wrap rubber bands evenly spaced along the folded fabric. Step 4: Apply the dye to the fabric, being careful to keep the color application within the sections created by the rubber bands. Step 5: Flip the fabric and repeat the dyeing process on the other side. With these steps, you can create a visually appealing striped pattern on your fabric. 3. Mini Starbursts Pattern The mini starbursts pattern is a creative option that adds small bursts of color to your fabric. To create this design: Step 1: Lay your fabric flat on the work surface. Step 2: Identify areas on the fabric where you want the starbursts to appear. Step 3: Pinch and gather small tufts of fabric in those areas. Step 4: Secure the tufts in place using rubber bands. Step 5: Apply the dye to the fabric, ensuring the tufts also receive color. Step 6: Flip the fabric and repeat the dyeing process on the other side. This technique will give your fabric a fun and vibrant touch with its mini starburst design. 4. Random Pattern For those who prefer a more abstract and unconventional design, a random pattern is an excellent choice. To create this pattern: Step 1: Crumple the fabric randomly, ensuring a variety of creases and folds. Step 2: Tie the fabric using rubber bands to secure its crumpled shape. Step 3: Apply the dye to the fabric, ensuring the crevices and surfaces are covered in color. Step 4: Flip the fabric and repeat the dyeing process on the other side. This technique will result in a truly unique and unexpected pattern on your fabric. Conclusion: Tie-dyeing offers endless possibilities when it comes to creating custom fabric designs. By using the techniques above, you can easily achieve stunning patterns ranging from traditional swirls to modern random patterns. Go ahead and unleash your creativity by experimenting with these tie-dyeing techniques!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have to find the value of 'l' in this equation: 406 * l + 320 * l - 3115 = 281 * l First, let's add the 'l' terms on the left side of the equation together: (406 * l) + (320 * l) = 406l + 320l Now, if we add these together like we would with numbers, we get: 726l - 3115 = 281l Now, let's move the '281l' from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do this, we will subtract '281l' from both sides: 726l - 281l - 3115 = 0 This gives us: 445l - 3115 = 0 Now, let's move the '-3115' to the right side of the equation by adding '3115' to both sides: 445l = 3115 Now, to find the value of 'l', we need to divide both sides of the equation by '445': l = 3115 ÷ 445 When we do the division, we find that: l = 7 So, the value of 'l' is 7 in this math problem.

Article: Some people say that today, reading is not as important as it was. These days we have photographs, films, radio and television. Why read a description of something when you can look at a photograph? Why read a newspaper when the latest news is brought to us every hour on radio and TV? Photography was certainly a wonderful invention. Photographs can give a very clear idea of places and of people that we have never seen. An encyclopedia , for example, is always better when it has good illustrations. But we also need words to explain the photographs and drawings. A photograph of an elephant may give us a very good idea of what an elephant looks like, but it tells us nothing about the different sorts of elephants there are and where they are found, their exact size and weight, how they can be useful to man and so on. In the same way, a good film has action, movement, color, and maybe music. These are things we do not find on the printed page. But reading a novel has certain advantages over watching even an excellent feature film. Reading a novel requires imagination. Each of us imagines a story differently. Watching news on television can certainly be exciting. But we need newspapers as well. Some important news stories happen when there are no cameras around. More importantly, a newspaper does not just report the news. It explains why something has been happening. It also contains interesting articles on different subjects. Newspapers are an important part of our lives, if we want to understand what is going on in the places we live as well as in other parts of the world.

Van der Biezen reached the semi final of the 2008 World Championship in Taiyuan , China . He qualified himself for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing . - BMX racing is a type of off-road bicycle racing. The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners that help the riders maintain speed. The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old. - Motocross is a form of off-road motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. The sport evolved from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom. - BMX, an abbreviation for bicycle motocross, is a cycle sport performed on BMX bikes, either in competitive BMX racing or freestyle BMX, or else in general on- or off-road recreation. BMX began when young cyclists appropriated motocross tracks for fun, racing and stunts, eventually evolving specialized BMX bikes and competitions. - Freestyle BMX is bicycle motocross stunt riding on BMX bikes. It is an extreme sport descended from BMX racing that consists of five disciplines: street, park, vert, trails, and flatland. - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway.

Q:U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened tariffs on an additional 100 billion worth of Chinese goods, on top of the 50 billion in import taxes he already has proposed against Beijing. Though none of the tariffs have taken effect, it's the latest posturing in a trade dispute that some fear could escalate into a trade war. For decades, Trump has complained about China's trade practices. One of his main complaints is what he calls Beijing's theft of U.S. intellectual property. Last month, Trump cited IP theft as justification for his proposed tariffs on 50 billion in Chinese goods. China retaliated by threatening its own tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. Trump then escalated the dispute, saying he would consider tripling the amount of goods to which tariffs would be applied. China gains access to U.S. technology by employing several tactics, which many observers have said are unfair or illegal. Beijing has long required that U.S. businesses transfer technology to Chinese companies as a precondition of entering the Chinese market. For instance, if you are a U.S. carmaker who wants to sell automobiles to China, Beijing requires that you team up with a local Chinese company, or face steep tariffs on imported vehicles. In other cases, China requires U.S. companies to comply with localization requirements by storing sensitive data in the Chinese mainland. That increases the risk of intellectual property theft through means such as cyberattacks.It's difficult to quantify the value of technological knowledge. But according to an estimate last month by the U.S. trade representative, Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs between 225 billion and 600 billion every year. That rate is unsustainable, said top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. \\"We can't afford to give up our technology,\\" Kudlow said Friday. \\"When they steal our technology ... they're stealing the guts of our American future.\\" The Chinese government has always denied carrying out the cyberattacks that frequently...

Article: Washington: NASA has announced evidence that Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, has a saltwater ocean under its icy surface. The ocean seems to have more water than all the water on Earth's surface, according to new Hubble observation. New Hubble observations of Ganymede's magnetic field strongly suggest that the moon, which is the largest in our whole solar system, is home to a subsurface ocean. Scientists estimate the ocean is 95 kilometres thick, which is about 10 times deeper than Earth's oceans. But unlike our salty waters, Ganymede's ocean is buried under 150 kilometres of ice. While scientists have speculated since 1970s about the presence of an ocean on Ganymede------the largest moon in our solar system------ until now the only observational evidence came from a brief flyby by the Galileo spacecraft, which didn't observe the moon long enough to confirm a liquid ocean. This discovery marks an important milestone, highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish. In its 25 years in orbit, Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy surface of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth. Scientists have already confirmed the existence of an ocean on Europa, another moon orbiting Jupiter, and NASA has announced plans to send an unmanned mission there searching for the life that might come with liquid water. Hubble is a telescope that orbits Earth, but because of its impressive gravitational analyses it can be used to study the inside of far distant planets. Using these same principles, scientists could theoretically detect oceans on distant planets as well. Question: What type of writing does this passage belong to?

Given the question: Question: Learning languages is difficult. Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?, Choices: - better communication - overthinking - frustration - misunderstandings - headaches The rationale to choose \\"frustration\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"frustration. The rationale for choosing \\"frustration\\" as the answer in this context is multifaceted. Learning languages is an incredibly complex process, and even in an immersive environment, mistakes are bound to happen. These mistakes can lead to misinterpretations, which can cause several negative consequences, but frustration is the most likely in this scenario. Here's why: 1. Emotional Reaction: Frustration is a common emotional reaction to challenging and difficult situations. When faced with a significant challenge, like learning a new language, it is natural to feel frustrated when things don't go as smoothly as planned. Making mistakes and experiencing misinterpretations can lead to frustration as learners may feel that their progress is hindered or that they are unable to effectively communicate their thoughts and ideas. 2. Persistence of Mistakes: As language learners spend more time in an immersive environment, they may continue to make mistakes. This can be frustrating because it may feel like they are not improving or are stuck at a certain level of proficiency. The constant presence of mistakes and misinterpretations may compound the negative emotions and lead to frustration becoming the most prominent feeling. 3. Negative Feedback Loop: The presence of misinterpretations can create a negative feedback loop. When a learner makes a mistake, it may cause misinterpretation, which leads to discomfort and frustration. This frustration can then make it harder to focus, leading to even more mistakes and misinterpretations in communication. This cycle can reinforce the feelings of frustration, causing it to become the dominant emotion in relation to language learning. 4. Impact on Confidence: Frustration can also impact a learner's confidence in their language skills. The more frustration they feel as a result of their mistakes and misinterpretations, the less confident they may become. This lack of confidence may make it difficult for language learners to attempt new forms of communication, or to continue pushing themselves to improve and grow in their language abilities. While overthinking, misunderstandings, and headaches may also be consequences of mistakes and misinterpretations in language learning, frustration stands out as the answer in this context. This is because frustration is an emotional response that often arises in challenging situations and is closely tied to the negative feedback loop language learners experience when making mistakes. Additionally, frustration has significant implications for a learner's confidence and their determination to improve and persevere in their language studies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Stanford did not employ a full-time professor in religion until 1951 and did not establish a religious studies department until 1973, later than most other universities in the U.S. Earlier courses in religion were largely offered by the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church. David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907, and by 1910, he was teaching New Testament Greek and Bible classes. Gardner's successor, D. Elton Trueblood, whose goal was the establishment of a non-denominational graduate school in religious studies at Stanford, taught classes about the philosophy of religion. In 1941 Trueblood's efforts to expand the study of religion resulted in the creation of a minor in religion, as well as twenty-one courses offered by him and four faculty members. By 1960, the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church no longer had to run the program, which had expanded to allow students the option of majoring in the study of religion. By the mid-1960s, the religious studies program at Stanford was enjoying \\"enormous success\\".In the 1960s, the study of religion at Stanford began to focus more on social and ethical issues like race and the Vietnam War. Leading this focus was Stanford Memorial Church Dean of the Chapel and Professor of Religion B. Davie Napier, who was \\"a powerful critic of U.S. policy in Vietnam\\". Napier, along with Stanford professors Michael Novak and Robert McAfee Brown, who had previously been faculty members of seminaries, were the subject of a Time Magazine article in 1966, describing \\"the renaissance of faith and learning at Stanford\\". Students crowded into the church to hear anti-war speeches by them, as well as by \\"notables\\" such as Linus Pauling and William Sloan Coffin.

Urlacher and Lewis bring to 28 the number of modern-era linebackers in the Hall. Five of those 28 were Bears a nod to the history of the position for the franchise from George Connor to Bill George Dick Butkus Mike Singletary and now Urlacher . “It’s unreal ” Urlacher said. “It’s a great tradition.” Selected ninth in the first round of the 2000 draft Urlacher becomes the first Hall of Fame playerfrom the University of New Mexico. He was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and was an established star before coach Lovie Smith arrived in 2004 with a scheme that accentuated Urlacher ’s freakish athletic ability for a player with such a large frame — 6-foot-4 258 pounds. The next year he was named the league’s Defensive Player of the Year becoming the fifth player to win both awards. The next season in 2006 Urlacher helped lead the Bears to Super Bowl XLI. Named to the NFL’s All-Decade Team of the 2000s Urlacher was selected to the Pro Bowl eight times and was first team All-Pro five times. In 13 seasons according to pro-football-reference.com he amassed 1 354 tackles 41½ sacks 22 interceptions two touchdowns 90 passes defensed 11 forced fumbles and 15 fumble recoveries. Personnel boss Mark Hatley made the decision to draft Urlacher who had played safety in college. The Bears knew they were getting a player who could transform their defense but initially weren’t sure how to deploy him . “We knew we would like to play him at the mike (middle) linebacker but the problem was he had been a safety and we didn’t want to stick him there right away and beat him up and lose him and ruin an excellent prospect ” defensive coordinator Greg Blache said. “We started him off at the sam (strong-side) linebacker position where everything is coming at you from one direction in the traffic and we played him at the mike in the nickel situation where 95 percent of it was passing. So he was getting a feel for it but he wasn’t getting in the heavy traffic with the guards coming on him and combination blocks … because it’s a whole different beast when you’re playing 12 to 15 yards deep as a safety and you move up to 5 yards from the line of scrimmage with the 300-pounders. “We knew we had something special and we knew he would be a guy who would be a hell of a player for a long long time if we had some patience and were just judicious in how we approached it. Having (linebackers coach) Dale Lindsey there was a huge help because Dale had developed so many linebackers and he was a great voice in saying he had seen rush jobs when guys were put in situations they weren’t quite ready to handle. It ended up working out really well just because we got him eased into it to the point where he was comfortable seeing it all happen.” It happened faster than anyone would have imagined which in retrospect isn’t surprising to anyone who was involved. Lindsey marveled at the amount of information Urlacher could process and then apply on the field. A lot of players even really good ones can lose the fine details when they move from the meeting room to the practice field and then into games but Urlacher absorbed it all. When middle linebacker Barry Minter was sidelined with a back injury in the third week of the 2000 season the Bears moved Urlacher . They never again discussed where he was best suited to play or what he could handle. “(Head coach) Dick Jauron said ‘Put him at the middle ’ ” Lindsey said. “Dick could see the big picture. Luckily for us Brian was more than willing to learn the new position. It’s nice when you have rare talent and a guy who wants to do it. That’s the difference between the real great players — they want to do it and they’ll do anything to be successful. He was like a sponge. You just kept giving him information and he absorbed it and would want more. The thing about the guys with the rare talent: They can do any damn thing you ask them. You can ask them the impossible and they can get it done. And Brian did it for us as a great middle linebacker.” When the Bears signed massive defensive tackles Ted Washington and Keith Traylor in 2001 Urlacher raised his game to a new level as the duo kept offensive linemen off of him and allowed him to make plays with his remarkable speed. “There are a lot of guys who can run fast in a straight line but the athleticism he showed for a guy that size off the charts ” Blache said. He spearheaded the “Monday Night Miracle” at Arizona in 2006 with 25 tackles and a forced fumble that resulted in a touchdown. Urlacher had five interceptions and five sacks in 2007 a testament to his ability to do anything needed. Urlacher was never very comfortable in the spotlight but always at ease around his teammates which made him immensely popular. He treated the newest rookie the same way he did the most tenured veterans. When former teammate Todd Johnson became a high school coach in Sarasota Fla. he didn’t have enough uniforms to dress all of his players. Urlacher provided new jerseys — home and away — for the entire roster and did so without seeking any attention one of countless anecdotes of how he helped friends.

The positive phrase indicates that the reader enjoyed the suspense and intrigue in the storyline. This is a significant aspect of the book, as it reflects how well the plot was developed and how much the reader was engaged with the story. The negative phrase suggests that the reader did not like a specific subplot or character relationship in the book, which is a less significant aspect when compared to the overall plot development.

U.S. lawmakers grilled Trump administration officials Tuesday about the war in Afghanistan, saying the new White House strategy was inconsistent and was not producing results. The comments made at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing reflected growing frustration in Congress about the U.S.-led war, which is entering its 17th year. ​As recently as November, General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, acknowledged that the conflict remained a stalemate. Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates. Despite the setbacks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is helping oversee the new White House strategy, gave a positive assessment of the conflict. \\"The president's South Asia strategy is showing some signs of progress,\\" Sullivan said. \\"On the battlefield, we are seeing the Taliban's momentum begin to slow.\\" But lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism. \\"Something is clearly not working,\\" said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and longtime Afghan war critic. \\"By any standard, the current security situation is grim.\\" Some lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump, who last week said he didn't want to talk with the Taliban — a statement that seemingly contradicted his own strategy. After Sullivan and a top Pentagon official told the lawmakers that the U.S. was in fact still open to negotiations with the Taliban, lawmakers pressed for more details. \\"You can see that the world and those involved in the peace process may be pretty confused about what the U.S. position is. What is it?\\" asked Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. Sullivan said he thought Trump was expressing a reaction to last month's terrorist attacks, and was pointing out that \\"significant elements of the Taliban are not prepared to negotiate.\\" \\"And it may take a long time before they are willing to negotiate,\\" he added. But many in the Senate appear tired of waiting, and that impatience was on display Tuesday.

A:","completion":"TWA Flight 553 was involved in a mid-air collision with a Beechcraft Baron private aircraft on March 9, 1967, resulting in the deaths of all passengers and crew members on both aircraft. The crash occurred near Urbana, Ohio, as TWA Flight 553 was descending towards Dayton International Airport, while the Beechcraft Baron was climbing after taking off from a local airport. I will now gather and present additional facts related to TWA Flight 553 to provide a comprehensive understanding of the event, the aircraft, and the TWA's actions before and after the crash. 1. Aircraft Model: TWA Flight 553 was operated using a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 jet airliner, a popular and reliable commercial aircraft during the 1960s and 1970s. 2. Aircraft Registration: The specific aircraft involved in the accident was registered as N1063T. 3. Aircraft Delivery: There is no publicly available information on the exact delivery date of the aircraft involved in the accident, but the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 series first entered commercial service in December 1965, and TWA was among the initial customers for the aircraft. Thus, the aircraft in question was likely delivered to TWA close to that time. 4. Collision Details: It is believed that the pilot of the Beechcraft Baron, who was flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), failed to maintain proper visual separation from the much faster TWA Flight 553, which was flying under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). It was also noted that the TWA aircraft was descending at a higher speed than recommended. 5. Investigation: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the accident and concluded that the probable cause was inadequate control of air traffic in the vicinity of the Dayton International Airport along with the procedural failure of air traffic control personnel. 6. Aftermath: As a result of this accident and other similar incidents, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) introduced changes to improve the overall air traffic control system and procedures to prevent such mid-air collisions in the future. This included requiring strict adherence to aircraft separation standards, improvements in radar equipment, and the establishment of the Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSA) to provide radar-based traffic advisories in high-density traffic areas around airports. In conclusion, while the exact delivery date of the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 aircraft involved in the TWA Flight 553 crash is unavailable, it can be deduced that it was likely to have been delivered close to the time when DC-9 series first entered commercial service in December 1965. The tragic crash on March 9, 1967, resulted in significant changes to air traffic control procedures to ensure better safety and prevent similar accidents from occurring in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) is an international organization that brings together zoos and aquariums to cooperate in efforts to advance the respectful, humane treatment of animals in our care, and to support the conservation of animals across the globe. WAZA was shocked and disappointed to learn of the inappropriate and damaging content in the new TV show Wonderful Friends, jointly produced by China's biggest zoo & circus company (Chimelong) and one of China's top TV companies (Hunan TV). The show dresses up chimpanzees in human clothes and markets them as \\"cute pets\\". The animals are placed in many stressful and harmful situations, in order to create \\"entertaining\\" story lines. It is disappointing to note that Chinese pop singer and actress Li Yuchun took part in this show, helping to popularize these misleading and inhumane practices. In one example, a young chimp bit an actress in the face right next to a zoo visitor, and then bit another actor leaving a wound on his hand. WAZA is strongly against practices and shows of this nature. Animals presented in such cruel and unnatural surroundings cannot contribute to serious conservation efforts. Presenting chimpanzees in unnatural and anthropomorphic settings suggests to viewers that they are not endangered and make great pets. Such shows are not only disrespectful to animals, they also lack any sort of conservation purpose. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, chimpanzees are now considered endangered, and wild populations are declining rapidly. WAZA recognizes that the growing popularity of television programmes such as Wonderful Friends can only increase the already-huge existing demand for chimpanzees as pets. WAZA requests the following: (1) The immediate cancel of this programme and similar shows wherever they may take place; (2) That all animals held in captivity be provided with the highest level of care; (3) That under no circumstances should chimpanzees be imported from the wild just for entertainment purposes. A:","completion":"Which statement best describes the concerns raised by the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) regarding the TV show Wonderful Friends? A.

A cave family called the Croods survives a natural disaster, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn and stern patriarch named Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn.

Plus, having an interesting book with you will give others an excuse tostart a conversation if they've read it. 3. Join a class, sports team, or club Yoga, salsa dancing, volleyball, Toastmasters (a public speaking club), a class for work, etc. Choose a new hobby or continue an old one! These are all great places to meet new people, primarily because you will be made to see the same people over and over again in the class. You will automatically make friends with them if you have a common interest and are made to see each other again. Question: The writer wants to tell you _ .

Answer the above question based on the context below: By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora. A:","completion":"The Knight Errant"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the last name of the two art critics who wrote about Virgin of Solitude? ? A number of plates in this group reveal a scepticism towards idolatry of religious images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and processional images, are mocked and denigrated. Plate 67, Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the \\"Virgin of Solitude\\". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, \\"It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations.\\" Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were \\"illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form\\".The published edition of The Disasters of War ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure. The last two plates show a woman wearing a wreath, intended as a personification of Spain, Truth, or the Constitution of 1812—which Ferdinand had rejected in 1814. In plate 79, Murió la Verdad (The Truth has died), she lies dead. In plate 80, Si resucitará? (Will she live again?), she is shown lying on her back with breasts exposed, bathed in a halo of light before a mob of \\"monks and monsters\\". In plate 82, Esto es lo verdadero (This is the true way), she is again bare-breasted and apparently represents peace and plenty. Here, she lies in front of a peasant.

Sacked: Paul Kellerman lost his job as a delivery driver after being wrongly recorded doing 103 mph when he was only driving at 34 mph. A delivery driver who was wrongly recorded speeding at 103 mph has been sacked despite the police apologising for the blunder and his van being unable to go above 70 mph. Paul Kellerman, 43, was dismissed after his firm received a prosecution notice stating he was caught speeding in a 40 mph zone, when he had actually been travelling at just 34 mph. The manager of the police force's speed camera unit later admitted the error, but the company would not relent and Mr Kellerman is still looking for another job. He was on his way to deliver electrical goods to Stevenage, Hertfordshire, when he noticed a speed camera flash as he drove along the Hatfield Road in St Albans. Paul, of Cudworth in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said: 'I saw the signs and knew it was a 40 mph zone but I knew I wasn't doing much more than 30 mph. 'I was gutted but I knew I was well under the limit. It's a high street, you can't do 103 mph and I wouldn't do that anyway.' His van even had a speed limiter on it, meaning it cannot go above 70 mph. Mr Kellerman contacted the police to complain and officers admitted their mistake. A letter from the speed unit manager said: 'On further investigation it is apparent that you were travelling within the speed limit at 34 mph in a 40 mph zone and the ticket was issued as a result of operator error.' The unit manager even telephone Mr Kellerman's boss but his job had already been filled. The speed camera had wrongly recorded the speed of Mr Kellerman's vehicle and the operator failed to check the speed before issuing the notice. Mr Kellerman, who worked up to 80 hours a week for £320, also called the speed unit and said they could not apologise enough. He said: 'I was told it was an error on their part. They kept saying they were sorry and I wasn't the first person but I have still lost my job.' Mr Kellerman has lost a stone and a half in weight since being sacked. He has also signed up for housing benefits and has had to ask for help in paying his rent. Error: Mr Kellerman was travelling at just 34 mph when he was flashed by the speed camera (library image) He said: 'I tried to explain to my boss that I would never drive so fast but was replaced straight away because of the constant flow of work. It's not him I'm mad at it is the police. 'I know everyone makes mistakes but not on that scale. If I'd not got a letter of apology nobody would believe me. 'I would have had to go to court and would have got an automatic ban. Other people have got to complain.' A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'A notice of prosecution was issued in this instance in error. 'As soon as it was brought to our attention we retracted the notice and apologised to Mr Kellerman. 'We have written to him to confirm non further action will be taken in respect of the notice and have also offered to write to the company but Mr Kellerman declined this offer. 'We have also spoken to the employer to explain the situation. The subject of his employment is a matter for him and the company.'

Start with the goal of the game and work backwards to figure out what players will need to do to get there. Ideally, the rules you create should be simple, logical, and consistent, so that the game plays out the same way every time (with different results, of course). In many classic board games, players roll dice and move their game piece a certain number of spaces depending on the number that comes up. More sophisticated games, like \\"Thunderstone\\" or \\"Settlers of Catan,\\" challenge players to build strong card decks or score points in order to win. For a game with a “paperboy” theme, players might roll to complete their newspaper route before the school bell rings while encountering obstacles like lawn sprinklers and unfriendly dogs on the gameboard. Keep them extremely basic at first. Little by little, you can make your rule system more intricate by adding secondary objectives, random events, or penalties for making poor decisions. Different types of games will work better with a different number of players. Most board games are designed for 2-4 players, but it may be possible for as many as 6 people to participate if the rules are simple and there are enough cards or pieces to go around. Keep in mind that the more people you have playing, the more difficult it will be to make the game mechanics work. A head-to-head strategy game could be played by as few as 2-3 people, whereas one that involves identifying a criminal from a lineup of suspects would benefit from having more players in order to make the gameplay more of a challenge. Your game might call for individual player pieces, cards, tokens, or any number of other components, depending on the theme and specific mechanics. The choice of what type of item will be used to perform the different actions is ultimately up to you. However, it will be best to go with accessories that are most practical for accomplishing the game’s goal. Stick to 1 or 2 components to keep the gameplay from getting convoluted. Players who are forced to juggle cards, coins, dice, and a pen-and-paper scorekeeping system will quickly find themselves overwhelmed. Now that you have an idea of how your game will play out, envision the exact form it will take. Designate your starting and ending points, draw out spaces, and mark where important pieces will be played. Be sure to label what each element is and describe how players will interact with them. When you’re finished, you’ll have a working blueprint for your game. The simplest game boards are there to direct the players’ movements. Others might serve as a platform for laying down cards and reading their outcomes, or provide clues for solving puzzles. Commit a crude version of your game board to paper as soon as an idea hits you. This will make it easier for you to work out any remaining kinks without losing the thread of the game.","completion":"This article explains how to create a board game by starting with the goal, making simple and consistent rules, considering the number of players, choosing game components, and designing the game board, while keeping the game enjoyable and easy to understand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The state police, along with their Tactical Mounted Unit, went in to get the situation under control. \\"First, the tailgaters ignored commands to disperse from law enforcement on the ground,\\" he said. \\"The crowd began to turn unruly and two PSP horses were assaulted and a trooper was injured.\\" The ground units were pulled back in an effort to deescalate the situation, Reed said, and the aviation unit was called in. Crews on the helicopter issued commands over a loudspeaker, ordering the crowd disperse. The intent was not to cause the disruption on the ground seen in the videos, though, Reed said. The helicopter only got that low to ensure people on the ground heard the commands, he added. \\"When personnel on the scene noticed the helicopter was low enough to disturb items on the ground, the helicopter pulled up to a higher altitude,\\" he said. The crowd dispersed shortly afterwards. The Tactical Mounted Unit and Aviation Section are routinely called in to assist in events with large crowds, he said. The two horses were not injured in the incident. ||||| Published on Sep 30, 2018 Pennsylvania State Police used approximately 20 troopers on foot and 6 mounted troopers in an attempt to break up a very large, rowdy tailgate party, before the Ohio State / Penn State game on 9/29/18. When that didn't work, they called in a state police helicopter. The helicopter pilot used the p.a. to order the crowd to disperse. And then apparently used the downdraft to get the point across, blowing down canopies, etc.. Although I don't personally think that was the intent. Two interesting things to note: 1) At 28 seconds you can see that someone in the area of the red canopies, threw something up at the helicopter. Whatever was thrown only made it to about half the height of the helicopter. 2) At 1:20 into the video, you can see that something is dropped/thrown straight down from the helicopter, into the crowd. I have no idea what the object was, but it appeared to be about the size of a 2-liter bottle. Correction to #2 - Watching the video again in slow motion, it is clear that a piece of light debris (paper/plastic bag?) was drawn up into the downdraft and then shot straight down to the ground. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video UNIVERSITY PARK -- A low flying State Police helicopter sent tailgate tents and other party supplies flying into the air Saturday at a parking lot outside Beaver Stadium.

Many people went on social media to complain about the low flying helicopter including those who said their tailgates were ruined by it.

According to the police, the video does not show tailgaters assaulting police horses and injuring a state trooper before the aviation unit was called in. The police tried to disperse a large-scale party of more than 500 people that was getting out of hand, but the crowd ignored their commands, leading to the deployment of the Tactical Mounted Unit.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was appointed as chief engraver in 1844? James Barton Longacre (August 11, 1794 – January 1, 1869) was an American portraitist and engraver, and the fourth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint from 1844 until his death. Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm. He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre. Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained. Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece. In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber. Longacre's coins are generally well-regarded today, although they have been criticized for lack of artistic...

Finally stones, pebbles and grains of sand were formed. Many sorts of plants and animals lived and died on the surface of the earth. Their remains mixed up with the stones, pebbles and formed soil. The outmost layer of the earth is soil. There are many ways in which large pieces of rock break into smaller ones. Wind, water, heat and cold help to break up rocks. When winds blow grains of sand against a large rock for a long time, the softer layers of the rock are slowly worn away. These leave holes and cracks in the rock, which become bigger and finally the rock breaks up into smaller pieces. The moving water of streams and rivers also helps to break up rocks. As the water moves along, it carries with it small pieces of rock. These rub the larger ones. Thus, the larger rocks are worn down to smaller pieces. The heat of the sun is also helpful to breaking up rocks. When the sun shines, the rocks become very hot. If these rocks are suddenly cooled, they may crack. Ice also plays a part in making soil. Water in the cracks can turn into ice in cold weather. As this happens, it becomes bigger and the cracks become wider, and finally break into smaller pieces. Question: Which of the following speeds up the breaks of rocks most? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Sharp changes in temperature.\\"?

Mrs. Kinsolving (Rosemary Murphy) is cold to Francesca, questions whether she is actually pregnant with her son's baby, and tells Francesca she wants nothing to do with her or her baby in the future. It soon becomes clear that Francesca cannot leave that night as a blizzard has made the roads impassable. Francesca is forced to stay in the Kinsolving mansion for a few days. She soon begins to suspect that something is amiss due to inconsistencies in information between what her late husband (Matthew) told her and Mrs. Kinsolving's statements to her. While Matthew never mentioned he had a sister, Mrs. Kinsolving claims that the mentally challenged and non-verbal Kathleen (Sian Barbara Allen) is Matthew's sister. After Mrs. Kinsolving retires for the night, Francesca sneaks around and discovers in the family Bible that Matthew's mother (Maria) died eleven days after Matthew was killed in the Vietnam War, that Mrs. Kinsolving is actually Maria's sister in law, Katherine, who is Kathleen's mother and the mother of Kenny (Richard Thomas), a serial rapist and murderer who is hiding somewhere in the Kinsolving mansion. Francesca goes into labor, but Mrs. Kinsolving refuses to call for an ambulance. She sedates Francesca heavily. When the baby is born, Mrs. Kinsolving announces it is dead and hands the baby over to Kathleen to bury. That night, Kathleen rouses Francesca and takes her to the attic where she finds Kathleen has hidden her baby (who is actually very much alive) in a picnic basket.

Zelah Clarke's Jane is more cerebral than otherworldly, but she makes a perfect foil for Dalton (who, appropriately, towers over her!) The nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing (once you've absorbed the shock of Dalton's charisma). There are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better; though this pretty much was a top-of-the-line production by the BBC's standards of that time.

Plot title: The Lady Vanishes Movie plot: Catherine Lacy, Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave in The Lady Vanishes English tourist Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) arrives at the \\"Gasthof Petrus\\" inn in the country of Bandrika, \\"one of Europe's few undiscovered corners\\". Iris is returning to Britain to marry a \\"blue-blooded cheque chaser\\", but an avalanche has blocked the railway line. The stranded passengers are forced to stay the night at the inn, including Charters and Caldicott, cricket enthusiasts who want to return to England to see the last days of the Test match. That evening, Iris complains about loud folk music coming from the room above her. She has the guilty musician, Gilbert Redman (Michael Redgrave), thrown out of his room, only to have him move into hers, forcing her to capitulate. Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty), a former governess and music teacher, listens to a tune performed by a folk singer under her window. Unseen by her, the singer is killed. The next morning, before catching the train, Iris is hit on the head by a planter apparently aimed at Miss Froy, who then helps Iris onto the train. Also on board are Charters and Caldicott, Gilbert, a lawyer named Todhunter and his mistress \\"Mrs. Todhunter\\". As a result of her injury, Iris blacks out. After the train is moving, Iris wakes up in a compartment with Miss Froy and several strangers. She joins Miss Froy in the dining car for tea. Unable to be heard above the train noise, the elderly lady writes her name on the window with her finger. Soon after, they return to their compartment, where Iris falls asleep. When Iris awakens, Miss Froy has vanished. The strangers in her compartment say they know nothing about an English lady. Even Todhunter in the next compartment, who spoke with Miss Froy earlier, pretends not to remember her. Iris searches, but cannot find her. She meets up with Gilbert, who agrees to help. Dr. Hartz (Paul Lukas), a brain surgeon, says Iris may be suffering from concussion-related hallucinations. Charters and Caldicott also claim not to remember Miss Froy,...

Question: Brett and Scott were both studying bacteria for their exam. Scott read more about nitrogen-fixating and sulfate-reducing bacteria, while his colleague Brett read more about non-respiratory anaerobe bacteria and facultative anaerobes. Which student read less about the production of the highly toxic dimethylmercury? Hint: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Scott read more about nitrogen-fixating and sulfate-reducing bacteria, while Brett read more about non-respiratory anaerobe bacteria and facultative anaerobes. The passage states that sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of highly toxic forms of mercury, such as methyl- and dimethylmercury. Since Scott studied sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are involved in the production of dimethylmercury, he likely read more about the production of dimethylmercury.

Further reinforcement of the concept is provided in Revelation 21:14 where the \\"lamb slain but standing\\" is the only one worthy of handling the scroll (i.e. the book) containing the names of those who are to be saved.

The lyrics of both \\"Son of Three\\" and \\"The She\\" suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, \\"Put on a Side\\", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's \\"voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily inside your brain,\\" as she repeats twelve words over the course of the song: \\"Better I better I stayed up / Better mono, put on a side.\\"An earlier version of \\"Full on Idle\\", Title TK's eighth track, was released on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal expressed an interest in redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of \\"Full on Idle\\" sound almost the same, but The Village Voice's Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska.

Instead, get a paper shredder to destroy the documents so other people can’t steal the information. Once the papers are shredded completely, you can throw the scraps away as usual. If you have important documents that you can’t get rid of, such as birth certificates, social security cards, or living wills, store them in a fireproof safe to protect them from any damage. Paper trays have multiple tiers so you can separate different types of documents. Pick a vertical paper tray if you don’t have a lot of space, or a horizontal tray if you have some room to spare. Put the organizer near the edge of your desk so you can reach it easily throughout the day and grab what you need. Label each of the tiers so you know where certain documents should go. You can buy paper trays from office supply stores. Paper trays also work great for holding folders or notebooks. Designate a section of your desk to stay clean so you have room to spread out if you need to. Wall pockets are plastic trays that have multiple compartments to file documents and folders. Put a wall pocket near your desk so you can remove papers from your desk and reduce clutter. Make sure the different compartments are labeled so you don’t get confused later on. Wall pockets can also be hung on the back of your door. Find a place on your wall that has enough space for a bulletin board and put one up. Organize the bulletin board into sections where you can pin items, such as documents, receipts, sticky notes, and memos. Keep the most important documents visible and stack older ones underneath. Many cubicles already have walls that you can put thumbtacks in. Use differently colored thumbtacks for each type of document you hang. For example, you may hang memos with blue pins and receipts with red ones. You can also pin personal photos if you don’t have space for them on your desk. Get file folders in various colors and sort your documents so similar ones all share a single color. For example, you may put different types of expenses in red folders and income forms in green folders. Label the tabs on the folders with what type of document is inside. Once you have your documents organized, put them in a filing cabinet in a paper tray so you can find them easily. You can also attach colored labels to the tabs of file folders if you don’t want to buy multiple colors. If you want to cut back on the amount of paper you’re using, try writing any of your notes or schedules on your computer. Create folders on your computer and sort your documents into them, or use an online program to organize your files. Once a file is outdated, delete it so it doesn’t clutter up your computer. Backup any important documents on a cloud storage site or external hard drive so you don’t lose them if your computer ever crashes.

(Step 1: Introduce the main subject and context of the article - the appointment of Marcelo Bielsa as Lille's head coach) Bielsa's Previous Successes: Marcelo Bielsa, affectionately known as 'El Loco' due to his unorthodox tactics and demanding training sessions, has had a successful coaching career with notable achievements. Under his leadership, Argentina progressed to the finals of both the 2004 Copa America and the 2004 Olympic Games, with the latter resulting in a gold medal for the South American nation. (Step 2: Provide background on Bielsa's achievements to establish credibility as a coach) Furthermore, Bielsa was instrumental in shaping Chile's national team into a formidable force between 2007 and 2011, effectively guiding them to the knockout stages of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. At the club level, the Argentine has managed several reputable European teams, including Spain's Athletic Bilbao and France’s Marseille. (Step 3: Mention Bielsa's other coaching experiences, illustrating his well-rounded football knowledge) Lille's Vision for the Future: The appointment of Bielsa demonstrates Lille's commitment to raising the team's profile within French football and competing on the European stage.

Premise: \\"It is documentary evidence against me.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"That book is a piece of evidence against me.\\" true?","completion":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"That book is a piece of evidence against me\\" is true based on the given premise \\"It is documentary evidence against me,\\" one must first carefully examine and interpret the meanings and implications of the terms \\"documentary evidence\\" and \\"book.\\" Documentary evidence refers to any form of evidence presented through documents, which can include written materials or other types of recorded information that can be presented in legal or investigatory settings. Examples of documentary evidence include contracts, emails, letters, and photographs, among others. The primary purpose of documentary evidence is to substantiate a claim, allegation, or statement by providing tangible, verifiable information. A book, in its most common form, consists of printed or written pages typically bound together with a protective cover. Books can be authored in various forms, including fiction, historical accounts, instructional works, and collections of research and evidence. In certain contexts, a book can serve as a form of documentary evidence if its contents contribute to the establishment of a factual claim or demonstrate a particular viewpoint in a conclusive manner. Given the premise \\"It is documentary evidence against me\\" and the above explanations of both documentary evidence and books, one can now assess the hypothesis \\"That book is a piece of evidence against me.\\" To do so, we will evaluate two critical factors: whether the term \\"it\\" refers to the mentioned book and whether the content of the book can be considered a form of documentary evidence. 1. Identifying the reference: To deduce whether the term \\"it\\" refers to the book mentioned in the hypothesis, one must assume the hypothesis is accurate and coherent. Since the book is specified in the hypothesis and not in the premise, the context may be insufficient to clearly identify the relationship between the two statements. Nonetheless, considering that both the premise and the hypothesis revolve around the concept of documentary evidence, we can reasonably deduce that \\"it\\" refers to the same source of evidence mentioned in both statements – the book. 2. Assessing the content: To conclusively determine if the hypothesis is true, one must examine the book's content as well. If the book contains information that can be used to implicate the speaker in legal or investigatory proceedings, then the book fits the definition of documentary evidence. The clarity and accuracy of assumptions regarding the two factors ensure that the hypothesis is highly likely to be true. If the term \\"it\\" refers to the book mentioned in the hypothesis, and the content of the book serves as a form of documentary evidence against the speaker, then the hypothesis \\"That book is a piece of evidence against me\\" aligns with the premise \\"It is documentary evidence against me.\\" In conclusion, based on the analysis of the provided premise and the nature of documentary evidence and books, the hypothesis \\"That book is a piece of evidence against me\\" is likely true. However, a definitive answer would require more specific contextual information that directly connects the premises and the hypothesis, as examination alone cannot guarantee absolute certainty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, we'll add 40 to both sides of the equation. 22 * z - 40 + 40 = -18 + 40 22 * z = 22 Step 3: Solve for the variable (z) Now that we have isolated the term containing the variable (z), we can solve for z by dividing both sides of the equation by 22. 22 * z / 22 = 22 / 22 z = 1 So, the solution to the equation 22 * z - 40 = -18 is z = 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The group, along with a broad coalition of disarmament, environmental, peace, and religious organizations, expects the boycott to put pressure on French companies to exert their economic influence and encourage Chirac to end all nuclear weapons testing. Q with options: Can we draw the following conclusion? International pressure is exerted to end French nuclear tests. Choose from: (i) yes. (ii) no.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that international pressure is being exerted to end French nuclear tests. The given information suggests that a variety of organizations from different fields, including disarmament, environmental, peace, and religious groups, have joined forces to stage a boycott. This collective action aims to pressure French companies and, ultimately, encourage then-President Jacques Chirac to put an end to all nuclear weapons testing. By conducting a boycott, these organizations directly affect the economic activity of the companies involved, which can then lead to monetary losses and financial hardships for the businesses. In turn, this can prompt companies to re-evaluate their support for the policies and decisions that led to the boycott in the first place - in this case, nuclear weapons testing. In addition to the economic pressure generated by the boycott, the vast array of organizations involved in the coalition showcases widespread international support for the goal of ending French nuclear tests. The participation of these diverse groups implies that this perspective is widely shared among various sectors of society and across different countries. By demonstrating this global support, the boycott further amplifies the pressure placed on French companies and their government with the ultimate objective of ceasing all nuclear weapons testing. In conclusion, based on the given information, international pressure is being exerted to end French nuclear tests."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Investigators from Kenai Police Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation also conducted a ground search, and a helicopter peered down looking for clues. “Both of these expansive efforts did not reveal the location of the missing persons,” KPD wrote in a release. Family members last heard from Adams on May 27 when she made a phone call to her sister, Lanell Adams, in which the missing mother sounded “distressed.” There was no sign of forced entry into the apartment and officers found the door to the apartment locked. Investigators did not observe any signs of a struggle or obvious signs foul play in the apartment. Both Adams and Jividen’s vehicles remain parked behind their home, but police could not confirm how long it had been since they had last been moved. While police are unsure what happened, they say Jividen enjoyed the outdoors., though there is no specific information that the family is in a remote wilderness areas. “We are hopeful members of the public will closely observe the missing person photographs and immediately report any sightings of the missing persons in urban areas, as well as remote areas of Alaska,” KPD wrote.

Rebecca Adams, 22, her two daughters aged 5 and 3, and her 37-year-old boyfriend Brandon Jividen were reported missing on May 27 from their home in Kenai, a city of about 7,300 residents 65 miles (105 km) southwest of Anchorage. An FBI canine scent detection team recently completed an extended search in wooded areas near the family’s apartment, Kenai Police said in a statement late on Wednesday. Ground searches, accompanied by aerial assistance, also ended. The department added in its statement that “there was no sign of forced entry into the apartment and officers found the door to the apartment locked. Investigators did not observe any signs of a struggle or obvious signs of foul play in the apartment.” The police said investigators “continue to work diligently on this highest priority investigation.” Officers distributed more photos this week of the family and vehicles left at their apartment. Authorities had already distributed photos to law enforcement agencies throughout Alaska. Police said family members last heard from Rebecca Adams on May 27. She was seen on a local business surveillance video several days earlier. Police also said they had evidence she was driving one of the family vehicles on May 25. Authorities say the family uncharacteristically left their home without notice, without paying rent, leaving behind their cars, camping gear and the children’s car seats. The family's dog is also missing. (Editing by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Peter Cooney) ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Upon conducting the search, law enforcement discovered a uniquely tailored CD that presented a significant danger. The object was specifically designed to go undetected by normal means, thanks to a special material that covered its surface. This material was instrumental in the potential destructive power of the CD, as it was responsible for causing an explosion as soon as the disc was inserted into a computer. Given the nature of the find, it is clear that the authorities were dealing with a highly dangerous and possibly deliberate criminal intent. The discovery of such an object raises multiple questions and concerns: Why was this person in possession of such a device? What was the desired outcome? Was this individual acting alone, or were there others involved in the plot? The incident would prompt a thorough investigation in order to ascertain the extent of the threat and gather more information about possible accomplices or related criminal activities. It could also serve as a warning to other law enforcement agencies and the general public, as a reminder of the diverse range of tactics and methods employed by criminals in their efforts to cause harm, evade capture, or obfuscate their criminal intentions. The discovery of the explosive-embedded CD highlights the necessity for continued adaptation of security and safety protocols as new technologies are created and adopted.

Q:Information: - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition. - Halmstad Municipality (\\"Halmstads kommun\\") is a municipality in Halland County on the Swedish west coast, in which the city Halmstad is the seat. - Timber framing and \\"post-and-beam\\" construction are methods of building with heavy timbers rather than dimensional lumber such as 2x4s. Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits (brace and bit), and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe.

Article:","completion":"Title: Lambing Live Presenter Addresses the Growing Concern of Food Waste and the Disconnection between the Public and Agriculture Introduction: In recent years, food waste has become a major environmental and economic concern across the globe. Lambing Live presenter, a passionate advocate for sustainable farming practices, has boldly declared food waste as \\"endemic\\" and criticized on how the public is too disconnected from the farming process. This article delves into the issues affecting the farming industry, the implications of widespread food waste, and the importance of reconnecting consumers with agriculture to build a more sustainable future. Food Waste: An Endemic Problem According to the Lambing Live presenter, food waste has become endemic, meaning it's a constant occurrence and an issue ingrained in society. This is a startling fact, as food waste has negative repercussions on multiple fronts. From an economic standpoint, throwing away perfectly good food leads to higher production costs, increased prices, and a strain on supply chains. Environmentally, food waste contributes significantly to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, since rotting food in landfills releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The Disconnection between the Public and Agriculture The Lambing Live presenter argues that one of the primary reasons for food waste is the detachment between the general public and the farming process. Nowadays, people are primarily living in urban environments, and their interaction with food is limited to supermarkets, grocery stores, and restaurants. There's a lack of understanding of how food is produced, the labor that goes into the process, and the sustainable farming practices that contribute to more environmentally and economically sustainable food systems. The public's misconception regarding perfect-looking produce cultivates a culture of waste. Many consumers believe that only fruits and vegetables with a perfect appearance are of high quality, leading to an increase in food waste at the production level. The significant number of discarded produce shows that many people are not aware of the impact their choices have on the environment and the economy at large. Reconnecting the Public with Agriculture Building a bridge between the public and agriculture is crucial to address the endemic issue of food waste. It starts with educating people on the importance of sustainable farming practices and the impact of their food choices on the environment and the economy. The Lambing Live presenter suggests that the media, educational institutions, and non-governmental organizations should play a significant role in this endeavor by spreading awareness about food production systems. Farm-to-table initiatives, community gardening, and visits to local farms can help reconnect people with the process of producing their food. This can help them gain an appreciation for the hard work of farmers, and it encourages them to make more informed choices when it comes to food consumption. Studies show that when people are more connected to the farming process, they are less likely to waste food. Additionally, government policies that support sustainable agriculture, such as providing incentives for responsible farming practices, combating food waste, and investing in infrastructure that supports local and organic food systems, can play a significant role in preserving our environment. Conclusion: The Lambing Live presenter's declaration of food waste as endemic and the concern for the public's detachment from farming are critical issues that need urgent attention. By reconnecting consumers to agriculture, promoting education about sustainable farming practices, and implementing policies that address food waste, we can ensure a more sustainable future for the planet and the people living on it. With collective effort and understanding, a change can be brought about to bridge the gap between the public and agriculture, ultimately reducing food waste for a greener and more sustainable future."},{"prompt":"Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the benefit that marked the last time Bowie performed his music on stage?

Article: Ahead of its official premiere this weekend, THR rounds up everything to know about who has been duped as well as some of the actor's new characters. On July 4, Sacha Baron Cohen posted a video of Donald Trump calling the comedian a \\"third-rate character\\" who needed to \\"go to school\\" to \\"learn about being funny.\\" The Independence Day clip hinted that Baron Cohen had a new project in the works, which Cohen teased again days later with another mysterious video. This one urged viewers to \\"imagine if Sacha Baron Cohen had been undercover secretly filming a new show for a year,\\" and included a clip of former Vice President Dick Cheney autographing a waterboard kit. The following day, Showtime revealed that the project was actually a new series, titled Who Is America?, which bows Sunday, July 15. In advance of the debut of what has quickly become must-see TV, The Hollywood Reporter rounds up everything we know about the show (so far). What Is It? A new half-hour satirical comedy from the actor, who returns to series television for the first time in more than a decade. Per Showtime, the \\"seven-episode series explores the diverse individuals, from the infamous to the unknown across the political and cultural spectrum, who populate our unique nation.\\" Who Is Behind It? The series was created and is executive produced by Baron Cohen. Other EPs include the actor's longtime collaborators Anthony Hines, Todd Schulman, Andrew Newman and Dan Mazer — who were all involved in at least one of Baron Cohen's Da Ali G Show-related projects (including its spinoff movies) — and The Daily Show's Adam Lowitt. When Does It Premiere? Who Is America? debuts Sunday, July 15, at midnight ET/Saturday, July 14, 9 p.m. PT online and on Showtime On Demand, and will debut on air July 15 at 10 p.m. on Showtime. Subsequent episodes will be released Sundays at 10 p.m. through Aug. 26. How Long Has It Been In the Works? Baron Cohen has been filming segments for the series during the past year, and a producer claiming to be working on a Showtime documentary series called The Age of Reason set up an interview with Ted Koppel — so the series has been set at Showtime since at least late 2017. But details didn't begin leaking until Baron Cohen's mysterious Trump teaser, which was likely filmed following the former reality star's appearance on Da Ali G Show in 2003. A message from your President @realDonaldTrump on Independence Day pic.twitter.com/O2PwZqO0cs — Sacha Baron Cohen (@SachaBaronCohen) July 4, 2018 That segment featured Baron Cohen's Ali G trying to get the then-Apprentice star to invest in an ice cream glove. While Trump tweeted that he immediately discovered the ruse ... I never fall for scams. I am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘Ali G’ interview — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2012 ... Baron Cohen told James Corden on The Late Late Show that Trump was actually there for \\"about seven minutes.\\" A few days after the Independence Day teaser, Baron Cohen released another video hinting at a new project, with footage of Dick Cheney signing the interviewer's \\"waterboard kit.\\" Cohen's publicist later confirmed that the signed waterboard kit is available to bid on eBay. Auction for the kit will benefit Amnesty International. The following day came Showtime's official announcement and the first trailer for the series. Who Has Been Duped? According to Drudge, both Republicans and Democrats were targeted, including Cheney, Sarah Palin, Howard Dean, Alberto Gonzales, Bernie Sanders, Trent Lott, David Petraeus, Ted Koppel and more. Former vice presidential candidate Palin was the first to speak out about the incident, penning a note accusing Baron Cohen of posing as a wounded soldier. After first speaking out in a Facebook post (below), Palin eventually revealed more details on Good Morning America about what she called a \\"sick\\" interview. \\"It mocked our values,\\" she said. \\"It was occurring to me that whatever this show is, whatever this interview really is, it is all about humiliation and devaluing middle-class Americans whom I represent.\\" Yup - we were duped. Ya’ got me, Sacha. Feel better now? I join a long list of American public personalities who have... Posted by Sarah Palin on Tuesday, July 10, 2018 Then came former congressman and current radio host Joe Walsh, who said he thought he was doing an interview to talk about his pro-Israel stance, and the interview was cut short when a fight broke out. I totally believe @SarahPalinUSA's account of the @SachaBaronCohen incident. Dressing up as a wounded veteran is absolutely stolen valor, his tactics are disguisting - I know cause I too was duped. Here is what happened...#BoycottShowtime — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) July 11, 2018 Former Alabama judge Roy Moore, who lost the race for an open Senate seat in his state after allegations of an inappropriate encounter with a 14-year-old girl, then released a statement saying he was targeted and threatening legal action against the comedian. “I did not know Sacha Cohen or that a Showtime TV series was being planned to embarrass, humiliate, and mock not only Israel, but also religious conservatives such as Sarah Palin, Joe Walsh, and Dick Cheney,” he wrote. Ted Koppel revealed to The Hollywood Reporter that he was interviewed by the same character who duped Palin. A producer purporting to be from a new Showtime documentary series said the show would include \\"conversations with distinguished experts in science and public policy, highlighting the brightest and most reputable minds on today's most important topics.\\" The show was supposed to include \\"ordinary folk interviewing the expert,\\" and a man in a wheelchair \\"with an oxygen tank hanging off one of the handles\\" arrived to Koppel's home and began asking him questions about the size of Trump's inauguration, but refused to concede even the most rudimentary of facts (like, say, the sun would have been down if a photograph were taken at 11 p.m.). Koppel said he cut the interview short after that. What Characters Is He Playing? So far, the only confirmed character is Dr. Billy Wayne Ruddick, the guy who duped Palin. A Twitter account for the character (retweeted by Baron Cohen) has been active since mid-May, tweeting links to stories hosted on his Infowars-like website, Truthbrary.org (sample articles: \\"Hillary is Satanist Illuminati,\\" \\"Secret CIA Time Travel\\" and more). Baron Cohen retweeted a statement from that account in response to Palin's accusations. \\"I am Dr. Billy Wayne Ruddick, founder/ceo/accountant of Truthbrary.org and it was I that interviewed you,\\" he wrote. \\"I did NOT say I was a War Vet. I was in the service — not military, but United Parcel, and I only fought for my country once. When I shot a Mexican who came onto my property. (Coincidentally, just like our Great President, I was sadly prevented from joining the regular army on account of bone spurs bein discovered in my testies.)\\" Conservative radio host Austin Rhodes told THR he was duped during a live radio interview while the comedian was posing as Dr. Nira Cain, a professor of gender and women's studies at Reed College in Portland. Rhodes told THR that \\"some of 'Dr. Cain's' best hits from the interview included calling the U.S. Army 'an active terrorist organization,' saying that The Dukes of Hazzard is like the Southern version of Roots,' and my favorite, claiming that 'white supremacists are responsible for most of the gun deaths in America.'\\" The production team even set up a fake Amazon listing for a book supposedly authored by Cain. One day after the show's premiere, Showtime released a statement about the Dr. Ruddick character in response to Palin and a hijacked Hollywood billboard spreading \\"misinformation.\\" The statement read: \\"There has been widespread misinformation over the past week about the character of Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., Ph.D., performed by Sacha Baron Cohen on the Showtime comedy series Who Is America? Baron Cohen did not present himself as a disabled veteran, and viewers nationwide who watched the premiere on Sunday can now attest to that. In Sunday’s episode, during an interview with Senator Bernie Sanders, Baron Cohen in character as Dr. Ruddick was asked by the Senator if he is disabled, and he stated that he is not and uses a mobility scooter to conserve his energy. In addition, Baron Cohen never presented himself as a veteran of the U.S. military to former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin during the booking process or during the filming of her interview, and contrary to her claims he did not appear in a wheelchair. In both the interview with Governor Palin and the interview with Senator Sanders, he did not wear military apparel of any kind.\\" Did Anyone Catch On? According to Rhodes, many of his listeners believed the interview — which was broadcast live — was \\"performance art\\" and he learned of Baron Cohen's involvement when a listener connected the name of the supervising producer, which was mentioned on air, with someone who had been involved with Borat. Said Rhodes, \\"The listener told us that [Todd] Schulman was the man who had secured his participation as a guest in the infamous \\"Southern dinner scene\\" in the hilarious Cohen movie Borat. A quick IMDb check revealed Schulman to be connected to virtually every project Cohen had starred in dating back to the Da Ali G Show, including Cohen's new show. I was flummoxed. I have been a fan of Cohen's work for years, and I have seen Borat probably 20 times from start to finish. How in the hell did I miss that this was Sacha Baron Cohen? When I replayed the show, literally the very next day, his voice was obvious, despite a clever attempt to disguise the voice we have heard in countless dialects and characters.\\" While local news reported the appearance at the time, no other media caught on. Who Is America? premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. on Showtime. Stay tuned to THR for a review and full coverage of the series. ||||| Photo: Jeffrey Mayer (Getty Images) As we get closer to this Sunday’s premiere of Who Is America?, Sacha Baron Cohen’s return to the TV prank/interview genre, more and more of Baron Cohen’s “victims” seem positively desperate to step forward and perform inadvertent PR for the series. Sarah Palin has already made her objections to the Showtime show known in a way that can only drive ratings forward, and she’s now been joined by Alabama judge, defeated Senate candidate, and accused creep Roy Moore, who issued a statement threatening to sue Baron Cohen for tricking him into appearing on the series, which we have to assume is a big part of the point of clowning on Roy Moore in the first place. Not that Baron Cohen isn’t doing plenty to keep the fires stoked himself; earlier today, the comedian—or rather, one of his characters, “Dr. Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr.”—fired back at “Vice-President Palin” on Twitter, accusing her of “being hit by a bullshit grenade” and suggesting that she’s now “bleedin’ FAKE NEWS.” It’s all perfectly funny, right-wing-baiting stuff, so why does reading it—and anticipating more of this sort of thing as the show’s run begins—make us feel so goddamn tired all of a sudden? Advertisement It seems weird, after all, to suggest that it hasn’t been long enough since Baron Cohen’s last reign of undercover terror. Bruno is nine years old at this point, and it’s clear that he and his team are as good as ever at working their ways into places they really aren’t supposed to be. (Case in point: This Hollywood Reporter piece about their infiltration of the show of conservative radio host Austin Rhodes, which includes a firsthand account of the tactics Cohen’s team uses to make sure their targets stay disoriented and wrong-footed.) But here’s the thing: When Baron Cohen was first doing his thing, making a fool of Newt Gingrich and tricking people into revealing their secret prejudices for the ever-watchful camera, it was back in an era where people were at least surface-level interested in keeping those prejudices secret. But the sad fact is that we no longer need elaborate stings or disguises to prove that people like Palin or Roy Moore are small-minded, xenophobic, frequently racist idiots; these days, that’s the makings of a moderately successful political brand. It makes the comedian’s antics feel a bit like yelling that the emperor’s got no clothes on, when we’ve spent the last two years knowingly staring, dead-eyed and helpless, at his wrinkled genitals as they flop around hatefully in our face. Advertisement Of course, Baron Cohen has surprised us before; it’s entirely possible that his series will tease something legitimately shocking or revelatory out of his encounters with America’s political elite. Hopefully we’ll be awake to see it. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Who Is America? is a new satirical comedy series from actor Sacha Baron Cohen, who makes his return to television after a decade.

We must drink at least eight glasses of water a day In 1945, the Nutrition Council in US suggested that people need to consume 2.5 litres of water a day. But the water contained in food, particularly fruit and vegetables, as well as in milk, juice and soft drinks, also counts towards the total. We only use 10 percent of our brains. This myth arose as early as 1907. People have long argued about our power of self-improvement and our brains' potential abilities. But detailed imaging shows that no area of the brain is silent or inactive. Shaving your legs causes hair to grow black faster and thicker. This theory is also illusion. Shaving has no effect on the thickness or rate of hair growth, studies say. Just over time, the edge of hair gets worn away and thus the edge of long hair becomes finer .

I didn't have cash but I did have a card. I bought him tea and 3 cookies. I made up a speech in my head to use when I gave the man his food. I kept repeating it in my head, trying emphasize how sorry I was that I didn’t have any money and that I hoped this food would be enough. My dad disappeared while I was ordering the food and I freaked out so much I forgot to apologize for not giving money.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was alienated from Johnson due to doubts concerning the 1965 bombing of North Vietnam? from the following article ? Hubert Humphrey was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes. As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party. Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue. Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine. This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years. The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days. Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law. Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the 1964...

Choose your story that continues the following story. It was easier for Robert than Aaron to tan because pick from the following. (1). Robert had a job where they worked outside.. (2). Aaron had a job where they worked outside..","completion":"It was easier for Robert than Aaron to tan because Robert had a job where they worked outside. Robert was employed as a landscape gardener, and his daily routine involved long hours outside, tending to lawns, planting flowers, and trimming hedges in various clients' gardens. Robert enjoyed his job, as it allowed him to stay active, maintain a connection with nature, and take pride in the beautiful spaces he helped create. During his lunch breaks, Robert would often remove his hat and shirt, lathering on some sunscreen to protect himself from the sun's harmful rays. Despite his efforts to stay safe, he found that over time, his skin developed a deep, glowing tan that even his sunscreen couldn't prevent. In the evenings, when he returned home after a long day of labor, Robert liked to check his ever-darkening tan in the mirror, which grew darker with every passing day of the warm summer months. Aaron, on the other hand, worked in an office as a software developer. His days were spent mostly indoors, hunched over his computer, writing lines of code, and attending virtual meetings. The only time Aaron felt the warmth of the sun on his skin was during his short walk to and from the local coffee shop for his daily caffeine fix. On a good day, Aaron might be able to squeeze in a quick half-hour outside, eating lunch in the park close to his office. Aaron envied Robert's sun-kissed glow and often wished that his own job allowed him more time outdoors. He would try to maximize his sun exposure during weekends, spending time at the beach or hiking in nearby forests, but it just wasn't enough to match the tan that Robert easily achieved. One afternoon, during a backyard barbecue at Aaron's house, the friends got to talking about their respective tans. Aaron complained about the unfairness of Robert's ability to develop such an impressive tan, while he himself remained stubbornly pale, despite his best efforts. \\"Why should you get all the good genes?\\" Aaron jokingly moaned. Robert listened sympathetically to Aaron's laments but couldn't help but feel a small swell of pride at his own healthy glow. He suggested that Aaron try to find outdoor hobbies or even consider walking or biking to work to get a little extra sun exposure. Examining their contrasting appearances, Robert stood tall with his well-toned muscles and deep tan, looking every bit the outdoor laborer that he was. Aaron, on the other hand, was slightly hunched from hours spent at his computer, his complexion still decidedly more on the pale side. Aaron took Robert's advice to heart and started spending more time outdoors, choosing to be more active during his spare time. He made a habit of going for a walk or jog every evening to catch the setting sun, and he even joined a local sports team that practiced outdoors. It took time and dedication, but eventually, Aaron was able to build a tan of his own, although it never quite matched Robert's bronzed hue. Despite their differing abilities to tan, Aaron and Robert remained close friends. Over the years, they enjoyed their outdoor pursuits together, each understanding and valuing the strengths and characteristics that made them unique. And while their tans faded with the seasons, the bond between them remained strong, glowing brighter with each passing summer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Brooklyn Park man charged in Gambian coup plot Papa Faal's home in Minnesota Kia Farhang / AP Federal prosecutors have charged a Brooklyn Park man with conspiring to overthrow the government of Gambia in West Africa. Papa Faal, 46, is charged with conspiring to violate the Neutrality Act by making an expedition against a friendly nation from the United States and conspiring to possess firearms to commit violence. Faal, who told investigators that he has served in the U.S. Army and Air Force, made his first court appearance Monday in Minneapolis. Another man, Cherno Njie, 57, appeared in court in Baltimore. Federal prosecutors say Faal was part of a group of 10 to 12 men, most from the United States and Europe, who traveled to their native Gambia to carry out the coup attempt. Some had served in the U.S. or Gambian armies and are skilled shooters. According to the criminal complaint, the men sent weapons to Gambia, including semi-automatic rifles that Faal shipped there in 50-gallon barrels. On Dec. 30, Faal and the other fighters gathered in the woods near the presidential palace, aiming to storm the building and force the turnover of the government. The soldiers guarding the complex fired on them, killing several of the dissidents. Papa Faal Courtesy of the Nigerian News Faal, a dual citizen of the United States and Gambia, told agents that even though it had been 23 years since he lived in Gambia, he still had family there \\"and felt a connection to his people.\\" According to the complaint, the group wanted to restore democracy to Gambia and improve the lives of its people. Faal told investigators he was first approached in August and agreed to join the movement because he became disenchanted with the way the Gambian president was rigging elections and because of his concerns for the plight of the Gambian people, according to the complaint. Over the next few months, the members of the group talked over the phone, had secret planning documents they shared with one another online, but rarely met in person. Faal told investigators they knew each other only by their code names. Prosecutors say Njie, a businessman in Austin, Texas who is a U.S. citizen, financed the operation. The group purchased thousands of dollars in weapons. Njie was to be installed as the interim leader of Gambia if the coup was successful. Faal told Magistrate Judge Franklin Noel that he is an instructor at ITT Technical Institute in Minneapolis. He's married and has one daughter, a friend said. This is not the first time that Minnesota has seen such a charge. The one that maybe bears the most resemblance is the case against Gen. Vang Pao, the late Hmong leader. In 2007, the U.S. government charged Vang Pao and nine others with plotting to overthrow the Lao government. The controversial prosecution prompted protests across the nation and in the Twin Cities. Two years later, federal authorities dropped all of the charges against Vang Pao.

After... ||||| U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder (Photo: Tony Dejak, AP) WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors have charged two U.S. men in connection with a violent failed coup attempt against the government of Gambia last month in an alleged conspiracy that included an undisclosed number of other Americans. Cherno Njie, 57, a U.S. citizen of Gambian descent living in Texas, and Papa Faal, 46, a citizen of both the U.S. and Gambia living in Minnesota, were named in a unusual criminal complaint made public Monday that outlined a months-long conspiracy in which firearms, including semi-automatic rifles, were allegedly shipped to the West African nation for use in the failed overthrow. Several of the assailants died in the Dec. 30 failed assault on the residence of Gambian President Yahya Jammeh. It was not immediately clear how many were killed and whether the dead included other Americans. In a video posted on the Gambian government's website, Jammeh said the assault was carried out by \\"dissidents'' based in Germany, the U.S. and Great Britain. Jammeh was photographed next to a flatbed truck that displayed an array of firearms reportedly seized in the attack. \\"I live for the Gambia,'' Jammeh said. \\"I die for the Gambia.'' Njie, an Austin businessman, is described in federal court documents as the financier and leader of the alleged conspiracy who was expected to serve as the \\"interim leader'' of the government had the coup succeeded. Faal, of Brooklyn Center, Minn., reportedly told federal investigators following his arrest that he had served in both the U.S. Air Force and Army, before his Army discharge in 2012. He joined the coup attempt, according to court documents, because he had become \\"disenchanted by the way the president was rigging elections and because of his concerns with the plight of the Gambian people.'' Both suspects are charged with conspiring to violate the Neutrality Act for their alleged actions against a friendly nation and conspiring to possess firearms in furtherance of a crime of violence. The two made brief, separate court appearances Monday. Njie did not challenge his detention in a Baltimore federal court. He will be moved to Minneapolis where the case will be prosecuted, federal officials said. A similar hearing was held for Faal in Minneapolis. \\"These defendants stand accused of conspiring to carry out the violent overthrow of a foreign government, in violation of U.S. law,\\" said Attorney General Eric Holder. \\"The United States strongly condemns such conspiracies. With these serious charges, the United States is committed to holding them fully responsible for their actions.\\" Up to a dozen members of the conspiracy, according to court documents, entered Gambia earlier this year, expecting that others, including a battalion of sympathetic Gambian soldiers, would join their side. Before their departures, which occurred between August and October, Faal and other conspirators allegedly purchased the firearms and shipped them to Gambia. The group also acquired night-vision goggles, body armor, ammunition, black military-style uniform pants, boots and other equipment. An estimated 30 firearms were shipped to Gambia, some of them hidden in 50-gallon barrels containing clothing, the court documents stated. \\"Faal admitted he knew shipping the guns was illegal, but was more concerned with carrying out the coup,'' the documents stated. On Dec. 30, according to the complaint, Faal and other conspirators allegedly gathered in the woods near the home of the Gambian president in Banjul where they split into two teams. At that time, prosecutors allege that Njie was waiting at a secure location until the teams took control of the home. The teams, however, were allegedly routed by heavy fire from guard towers when they approached, resulting in the deaths of several conspirators. Faal and Njie fled, returning to the U.S., where they were arrested. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Igx9ec ||||| A U.S. Army veteran and a Texas businessman appeared in federal court Monday charged with a most unusual crime: plotting to overthrow the West African government of Gambia. And there may have been more Americans—and possibly more American veterans—involved, based on statements given to an FBI agent by Papa Faal, the vet whose alleged role in the plot involved smuggling weapons into Gambia. “Most, if not all, members of the group had served in the U.S. or Gambian military,” Faal told FBI agent Nicholas Marshall, according to an affidavit. While Faal appeared in a Minnesota courtroom, his alleged co-conspirator, Gambian-American Cherno Njie, stood before a Baltimore judge. The two had been working together since August, but Faal may have only recently learned the name of Njie, the would-be ruler of Gambia. “The members of the group were known to each other by code names,” Marshall’s affidavit noted. Faal’s code name was “Fox.” The Pentagon said Faal served in the Air Force for seven years, during which time he became a U.S. citizen. He later spent three years in the Army, starting with training at Georgia’s Fort Benning and serving as a sergeant during an 11-month deployment to Afghanistan in 2011, Army officials confirmed. Faal told the FBI that his group was trying “restore democracy to The Gambia and improve the lives of its people.” Believing they had “up to 160 members of the local Gambian military” on their side and that the president’s guards wouldn’t risk their lives to defend him, the coup members “hoped they would be able to take over the country without having to kill any Gambians,” according to Faal. Faal has some experience in both political and security matters, it seems. The Amazon biography for an author named Papa Faal mentions both Gambia and lists a military record that matches the FBI report. “Papa Faal is from the Gambia, West Africa. He served in the United States military for 10 years, spending seven years of his service in the United States Air Force with the 459th ARW, and three years in the United States Army with the 201st Brigade Support Battalion. He culminated his military service with a tour in Afghanistan.” Faal’s book, A Week of Hell: How Rebels Shattered the Innocence and Peace of a Nation—One Family's Story of Survival, details the bloody consequences of a previous attempt to take over Gambia’s government. A Week of Hell recounts the events of 1981, when, as the book recounts, “a gang of rebels took over the [Gambian] government and held the president’s wife and children… hostage while releasing the country’s most dangerous prisoners to inflict a frenzy of carnage and chaos.” Faal evades easy categorizations. He is an American and a Gambian, a published author of political history working on his doctorate, and a U.S. Army and Air Force veteran. But those strands of his identity are all wound around the conspiracy that led him back to Gambia for the first time in 23 years. Gambia’s current president, Yahya Jammeh, was a junior military officer when he took power after leading his own coup in 1994. For the past 18 years, Jammeh has commemorated the date of his coup, which overthrew a democratically elected government, with a national celebration. The man seeking to depose Jammeh, Gambian-American Texas businessman Njie, was known to Faal by his code name “Dave” during their months of planning. Njie has no obvious qualifications for running a country, but a search of his apartment by the FBI turned up evidence of his planning. Along with a spreadsheet logging weapons purchases and other expenses, investigators found two documents. One was a handwritten note “that appears to describe the author’s vision for The Gambia following a transition in political power.” A second document was titled: “Gambia Reborn: A Charter for Transition from Dictatorship to Democracy and Development.” A November 2014 profile of Njie by the editor of the Texas-based newspaper The Gambia Echo & Tribune begins with a quote from Shakespeare and proceeds to greater heights of reverence. Njie is a “serious fellow with a very sharp intellect, unassuming, attentive, calm and calculating but equally shrewd and lucid and above all, highly disciplined and introspective with a penchant for academic and political discourse.” He’s also the “CEO and owner of dual multimillion-dollar Austin-based companies,” a source of Gambian pride, and an exemplar of American exceptionalism, according to the article. While “Dave” handled money and orchestrated between the various plotters, unknown to each other, Faal’s job was getting guns to Gambia. Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

Faal legally purchased M4 semi-automatic rifles—the same model used by the U.S. Army—hid them in barrels stuffed with clothing, and shipped them to Gambia under an alias. Another member of the plot took care of the ammo along with black uniforms, night-vision equipment, and body armor. The various members met for the first time when they traveled to Gambia at the beginning of December to carry out their plan. There, according to Faal’s account to the FBI, they acted like a group with some military experience. They conducted reconnaissance and dry runs, and adjusted their plans when they got new intelligence about the president’s whereabouts. The conspirators were split into two teams, “Alpha” and “Bravo.” Alpha was to storm the State House, where they expected the president to be on New Year’s Day, and Bravo was to secure the rear of the building. Their leader, Njie, still going by “Dave” during the operation, would stay a safe distance away until the State House was secure. As it happened, the coup members found the State House “fortified with additional soldiers.” When an Alpha Team member fired a shot in the air meant to scare off the guards whom they didn’t expect to put up much of a fight, they took “heavy fire from the guard towers.” From there the plan went to hell. Alpha Team was killed, Faal told the FBI, while the Bravo members who were not gunned down fled. While Faal and Njie are in U.S. custody, the whereabouts of the other survivors is unknown. Gambia’s president, Jammeh, has denied there was any coup attempt. He called the events last week “an attack by dissidents based in the U.S., Germany, and U.K.,” and pointed to U.S.-made weapons involved in the plot. Jammeh is known for making wild claims. In 2007 he said he had discovered a cure for AIDS using natural herbs. But his account of a dissident plot involving Gambian expats using U.S. weapons is similar to what Faal told the FBI. Most coup members “lived in the diaspora in the United States and Germany,” Faal said. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A Brooklyn Park man named Papa Faal, who is a dual citizen of the United States and Gambia, and has served in the U.S. Army and Air Force, was charged along with Texas property developer and U.S. citizen Cherno Njie for conspiring to overthrow the Gambian government.

Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process described is the colonization of an area by pioneer plants, such as lichens, mosses, and small grasses. This typically occurs in areas where the soil quality is poor or where a natural disturbance, like fire or erosion, has cleared away the previous plant population. As these pioneer plants grow, they help to stabilize the soil, suppress erosion, and provide shelter for nearby organisms. When they die, their decomposition adds organic material to the soil, thus improving its nutrient content and texture. This, in turn, makes the area more fertile, eventually allowing for the growth of larger plants and ultimately leading to the succession of forests or other more complex ecosystems."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. and the situation: The Gorge saw some negative effects due to deforestation. The Valley has a more fertile soil, it's not overgrazed, and the trees and bushes are abundant, and the productivity has increased several fold over the past decade. Biodiversity in the Valley is varied, and the soils are nutritious and retain more water, nitrogen and carbon. Answer the following question: Which area experiences less soil erosion? Answer:","completion":"The area that experiences less soil erosion is the Valley. The first step in arriving at this answer is to analyze the given background and situation information. Let's break down the characteristics of both the degraded land and the Valley in separate points for better understanding. Degraded land: 1. Declining biodiversity 2. Less adaptable to disasters 3. Smaller food supply for animals 4. Poor soil quality with low nutrients like water, nitrogen, and carbon 5. Increased frequency of dust storms due to degradation 6. Soil erosion becomes a bigger problem due to fewer plants to anchor the soil Valley: 1. More fertile soil 2. Not overgrazed 3. Abundant trees and bushes 4. Increased productivity over the past decade 5. Varied biodiversity 6. Nutritious soil that retains more water, nitrogen, and carbon By comparing these two sets of characteristics, we can determine that the Valley has a healthier ecosystem, with more fertile soil, better biodiversity, and an overall more stable environment. These factors contribute to a lower risk of soil erosion in the Valley compared to the degraded land.

Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Bunessan is a small village on the Ross of Mull in the south-west of the island of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland. The settlement is within the parish of Kilfinichen and Kilvickeon, and is situated on the A849. - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides.

He founded the important abbey on Iona, which became a dominant religious and political institution in the region for centuries. He is the Patron Saint of Derry. He was highly regarded by both the Gaels of Dál Riata and the Picts, and is remembered today as a Christian saint and one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland. - Iona is a small island in the Inner Hebrides off the Ross of Mull on the western coast of Scotland.

In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - Knockan is a township of six crofts in the community of Ardtun, in the south of the island of Mull off the west coast of Scotland. - A harbor or harbour (see spelling differences), or haven, is a body of water where ships, boats and barges seek shelter from stormy weather, or are stored for future use. Harbors and ports are often confused with each other. A port is a manmade facility built for loading and unloading vessels and dropping off and picking up passengers. Ports are often located \\"in\\" harbors. - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland.

From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process.

Americans like to wear simple and single-colored jeans, but many Chinese people like to wear jeans with lots of different colors. Now we can see jeans everywhere. However, in many places, it's not always good to wear jeans. No matter how good they may look, or what color they are, it's often not right to wear jeans in formal places.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Eli and Daniel (David So) are two Korean American brothers who own their late father's struggling shoe store in a predominantly African American community of Paramount, California. They have a unique and unlikely friendship with an 11-year-old African American girl, Kamilla. These three deal with hardships on a daily basis; Eli and Daniel face racism from African Americans and Hispanics, and Kamilla has a troubled family after the death of her mother some years earlier, who warn her to stay away from the shoe store. Kamilla is also constantly badgered by Mr. Kim, who owns a liquor store near Eli and Daniel's shoe store; this leads to Eli often intervening on Kamilla's behalf, straining the relationship between Mr. Kim and Eli. Mr. Kim speaks to Eli in Korean and Eli replies primarily in English, and occasionally in Korean. On April 29th, 1992, the news of the day is focused on the pending Rodney King assault verdict, Kamilla ditches school and heads to the shoe store; Eli stresses about the store staying afloat, while Daniel tries to have a good time often disregarding the customers while dreaming of becoming a recording artist.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: I have a new situation: The city of Reslie is known for its grilled cheese sandwiches. People come from all over the world to taste their sandwiches. The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not. But I can use this background: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. What is an answer for this question: Will Reslie need to replace their levees sooner or later than Tichago Answer:","completion":"Given the information you provided, it can be inferred that the city of Reslie will likely need to replace their levees sooner than Tichago. The presence of soil piping in Reslie can cause levee and dam failure. This is a form of soil erosion that occurs beneath the soil surface and leads to the weakening and eventual failure of structures like levees and dams. The turbulent flow involved in soil piping erodes away soil, gradually compromising the structural integrity of these constructions. On the other hand, Tichago does not have a reported soil piping problem, which indicates its levees are presumably not being subjected to the same erosive forces that Reslie's are. While it is not explicitly discussed, if Tichago does have levees, they will presumably last longer against structural failure in the absence of soil piping. However, it's important to note that this answer assumes that the only factor affecting the lifespan of the levees in both cities is soil piping. There could be other environmental, soil, or human-induced factors at play that were not mentioned, such as the soil salinity described in your background information. High soil salinity can also compromise the structural integrity of constructions like levees and dams. But based on the information you provided, we do not know if either city is dealing with significant soil salinity issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This article: Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved. Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him.

TfL said it was seeking interest from industry to help supply the onboard speed monitoring systems. Union Aslef welcomed the new system but said it was \\"belated\\". An investigation by the Rail Accidents Investigation Branch (RAIB) found the crashed tram had been travelling at 43.5mph in a 12mph zone and found no evidence of any track defects or obstructions. Last month London Mayor Sadiq Khan wrote to the RAIB to raise his concerns following allegations tram drivers have fallen asleep at the controls after the BBC revealed four former tram drivers fell asleep while operating trams in Croydon. Three trams have been recorded speeding since the Croydon crash. It's early days but TfL are looking to fundamentally change the capital's tram safety systems. Previously they had been regarded as buses on tracks. Now they are being moved into the realm of light rail with tighter safety measures. Safety has been in the spotlight since the Croydon disaster but there have also been a number of reports of tram drivers falling asleep at the controls. This system would prevent speeding, but it could also intervene and apply the brakes if the driver became incapacitated.

Geological history of Earth During the Permian all the Earth's major land masses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea.

Sentence 2: Beijing abuses its power towards Hong Kong. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is true based on the first sentence, let's break down the information provided: 1. The first sentence introduces the idea that international attention is an important check against any abuse of power by Beijing toward Hong Kong. This suggests that external monitoring can potentially deter Beijing from engaging in aggressive actions. Nevertheless, the sentence does not explicitly confirm nor deny whether Beijing is actually abusing its power at the moment. 2. The second sentence plainly states that Beijing abuses its power towards Hong Kong. Now, let's analyze the relationship between these two sentences: - If Sentence 1 is true (meaning international attention is an important check against abuse of power), it does NOT automatically determine the truthfulness of Sentence 2 (whether Beijing is abusing its power or not). The first sentence describes a potential deterrent against an abusive situation, but it does not necessarily confirm or deny that situation is currently taking place. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, we cannot directly conclude if the second sentence is also true. Instead, additional information or evidence regarding Beijing's actions towards Hong Kong would be needed to assess the veracity of the second sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

President Barack Obama's approval rating is now at 41 percent, according to a new poll. That's five percent down from where it was just a month ago. Dissatisfaction with the President's signature healthcare law continues to play a large role in Americans' disgruntlement with the President. Support for Obamacare is also down five percent from last month. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: President Obama's Approval Rating Drops Amid Obamacare Dissatisfaction Introduction: Recent polls have shown a decline in President Barack Obama's approval rating, reaching a low of 41 percent. This marks a significant five percent drop from just a month ago. A key contributor to this decline appears to be the ongoing dissatisfaction with the President's signature healthcare law, Obamacare, which has also seen a five percent decline in support over the last month. Step 1: Discuss the poll results To create a comprehensive understanding of the poll results, it is essential to highlight the key figures, such as President Obama's approval rating of 41 percent and the five percent drop in support for Obamacare. This will enable readers to visualize how the President's popularity has declined in this short span of time. Step 2: Address the connection between the approval rating and Obamacare The ongoing dissatisfaction with Obamacare is reportedly playing a substantial role in shaping American's disgruntlement with President Obama. By connecting the decrease in the President's approval rating to the diminishing support for Obamacare, readers can understand the possible reasons behind the decline in popularity. Step 3: Analyze the reasons for dissatisfaction with Obamacare In order to provide a thorough analysis of the situation, it is vital to discuss the reasons behind the dissatisfaction with Obamacare. Issues such as high insurance premiums, limited provider networks, or shortcomings in the system's design might be contributing factors to the dissatisfaction of the public. By addressing these concerns, readers can gain insight into the public's disappointment with the healthcare law. Step 4: Highlight the consequences of a low approval rating It is important to discuss the potential consequences of these poll results for President Obama's legacy and policy initiatives. A low approval rating could signal difficulty in gaining support for future legislation or making significant changes. It might also impact the Democratic Party's chances in upcoming elections if voters are not satisfied with the President's performance. Conclusion: President Barack Obama's approval rating has seen a notable decline, dropping to 41 percent. A major factor in this decline is the dissatisfaction with his signature healthcare law, Obamacare, which has led to the erosion of public support. As the dissatisfaction with Obamacare persists, the potential impact on the President's legacy and policy initiatives remains uncertain. It is crucial for the administration to address these concerns in order to regain the trust of the American people and secure the future success of the President's agenda."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who told Bernhard Cossmann to \\"listen to the instrumentation\\" and claimed it was his own? from the following article ? While Raff was able to offer \\"practical suggestions [in orchestration] which were of great value to Liszt\\", there may have been \\"a basic misunderstanding\\" of the nature of their collaboration. Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works. Raabe demonstrated that, regardless of the position with first drafts, or of how much assistance Liszt may have received from Raff or Conradi at that point, every note of the final versions represents Liszt's intentions.

Given these facts, what can chemical splashing cause to humans among the following options: - death - pain - pleasure - birth - satisfaction - cancer - deadly - Injury Answer:","completion":"Chemical splashing can cause significant harm to humans, particularly if the chemicals involved are hazardous or corrosive substances. Among the given options, chemical splashing can potentially cause: 1. Death: In some severe cases, chemical splashing can lead to death, especially when the chemicals in question are highly toxic. When these harmful substances come into contact with the skin, eyes, or respiratory system, they can cause chemical burns, respiratory failure, or systemic poisoning. Immediate medical attention is essential in such life-threatening situations. 2. Pain: Chemical splashing can cause acute pain and discomfort when the skin or eyes come into contact with hazardous substances. The chemicals may cause burning sensations or irritation, leading to significant physical distress. Depending on the nature of the chemical exposure, the severity of the pain can range from mild to unbearable. 3. Cancer: Certain chemicals are known to be carcinogens, which means they are capable of causing cancer in living tissues. Prolonged or repeated exposure to such chemicals may increase the risk of developing cancer. So, while an isolated incident of chemical splashing may not directly cause cancer, it can indirectly contribute to long-term health risks. 4. Injury: Injuries are a common and direct consequence of chemical splashing. When harmful chemicals come into contact with the skin, eyes, or other body parts, they may cause chemical burns, lacerations, or irreversible tissue damage. The severity of the injury depends upon the type, concentration, and amount of chemical involved, as well as the length of exposure time and the individual's susceptibility. 5. Deadly: \\"Deadly\\" is similar to \\"death\\" in this context, as it implies that chemical splashing can have severe, life-threatening consequences if not treated promptly and appropriately. The term \\"deadly\\" emphasizes the potential for severe outcomes due to chemical exposure and reinforces the importance of proper handling and safety precautions when working with hazardous substances. While chemical splashing can cause death, pain, cancer, injury, and be deadly, it is important to note that it is unlikely to cause pleasure, birth, or satisfaction. These terms are unrelated to the potential hazards associated with chemical exposure and do not adequately describe the consequences of chemical splashing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: I'd not noticed this until someone drew my attention to it, but the latest IMF Fiscal Monitor, published last month, comes about as close to declaring Spain insolvent as you are ever likely to see in official analysis of this sort. Of course, it doesn't actually say this outright. The IMF is far too diplomatic for such language. But that's the plain meaning of its latest forecasts, which at last have an air of realism about them, rather than being the usual dose of wishful thinking. Let's take the projected budget deficit first. This is expected to decline quite steeply this year to 6.6 per cent of GDP, but that's mainly because the cost of bailing out the banking sector fell substantially on last year's budget. On a like-for-like basis, there has in fact been very little fall in the underlying deficit. And nor on the present policy mix is there ever likely to be, for that's where the deficit is projected to remain until the end of the IMF's forecasting horizon in 2018. Next year, the deficit is expected to be 6.9 per cent, the year after 6.6 per cent, and so on with very little further progress thereafter. Remember, all these projections are made on the basis of everything we know about policy so far, so they take account of the latest package of austerity measures announced by the Spanish Government. The situation looks even worse on a cyclically adjusted basis. What is sometimes called the \\"structural deficit\\", or the bit of government borrowing that doesn't go away even after the economy returns to growth (if indeed it ever does), actually deteriorates from an expected 4.2 per cent of GDP this year to 5.7 per cent in 2018. By 2018, Spain has far and away the worst structural deficit of any advanced economy, including other such well known fiscal basket cases as the UK and the US. So what happens when you carry on borrowing at that sort of rate, year in, year out? Your overall indebtedness rockets, of course, and that's what's going to happen to Spain, where general government gross debt is forecast to rise from 84.1 per cent of GDP last year to 110.6 per cent in 2018. No other advanced economy has such a dramatically worsening outlook. And the tragedy of it all is that Spain is actually making relatively good progress in addressing the \\"primary balance\\", that's the deficit before debt servicing costs. What's projected to occur is essentially what happens in all bankruptcies. Eventually you have to borrow more just to pay the interest on your existing debt. The fiscal compact requires eurozone countries to reduce their deficits to 3 per cent by the end of this year, though Spain among others was recently granted an extension. But on these numbers, there is no chance ever of achieving this target without further austerity measures, which even if they were attempted would very likely be self defeating. IN any case, it seems doubtful an economy where unemployment is already above 25 per cent could take any more. In the past, the IMF has been guilty of being far too optimistic about Spain, both on the outlook for growth and the public finances, so it's possible it is now committing the reverse mistake of undue pessimism. Yet somehow I doubt it. Spain is chasing its tail down into deflationary oblivion. All this leads to the conclusion that a big Spanish debt restructuring is inevitable. Spanish sovereign bond yields have fallen sharply since announcement of the European Central Bank's \\"outright monetary transactions\\" programme. The ECB has promised to print money without limit to counter the speculators. But in the end, no amount of liquidity can cover up for an underlying problem with solvency. Europe said that Greece was the first and last such restructuring, but then there was Cyprus. Spain is holding off further recapitalisation of its banks in anticipation of the arrival of Europe's banking union, which it hopes will do the job instead. But if the Cypriot precedent is anything to go by, a heavy price will be demanded by way of recompense. Bank creditors will be widely bailed in. Confiscation of deposits looks all too possible. I don't advise getting your money out lightly. Indeed, such advise is generally thought grossly irresponsible, for it risks inducing a self reinforcing panic. Yet looking at the IMF projections, it's the only rational thing to do. PS. I don't include creditors of the British arm of Santander in this warning, who are ring fenced from the mothership back bome in Spain, theoretically at least.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Earth Crisis is an American metalcore band from Syracuse, New York, active from 1989 until 2001, reuniting in 2007. Since 1993 the band's longest serving members are vocalist Karl Buechner, guitarist Scott Crouse, bassist Ian Edwards and drummer Dennis Merrick. Their third guitarist Erick Edwards joined the band in 1998. The band has released eight studio albums, three compilations, two live albums and six music videos. Context: Although ideologically tied to the straight edge movement, the initial musical influences of Earth Crisis were mainly from New York hardcore bands such as Agnostic Front, Cro-Mags and Sick Of It All. After the All Out War EP, they developed an increasingly technical and heavier style, citing death metal bands Napalm Death, Bolt Thrower and Obituary as prime inspirations. Buechner's vocals became rougher with each release as well, culminating in the completely gutturally screamed Gomorrah's Season Ends. Terrorizer magazine referred to this album as \\"heavy hardcore taken to a new level, all the blackness that was hinted at on Firestorm realized in all its formidable glory.\\" In this period, many of their songs were built on Merrick's drum beats. Their third studio album, Breed the Killers, maintained the previous aggressiveness and its growled vocals were \\"taken about as far as possible\\", but it followed a structure more akin to the \\"post-Judge hardcore of the Path of Resistance record Who Dares Wins\\", according to Shawn Macomber of Decibel. Dennis Merrick said: \\"On Breed the Killers I think we achieved the most honest representation of our sound without sounding too raw or too slick\\". Its follow-up, Slither, had a change of style that steered towards nu metal. Buechner declared that, rather than being influenced by other styles, they \\"resurrected\\" the sound of All Out War in a proper way, which also had melodic choruses and spoken word verses. Their first post-reunion album, To the Death, was described by Buechner as \\"a mixture between Destroying the Machines and Breed the Killers.\\" According to Stereo Killer, it was \\"arguably the band's heaviest offering\\" but with \\"more traditional verse/chorus/verse\\" material. Neutralize the Threat followed a similar path, but \\"with a Gomorrah's Season Ends vibe thrown in\\", the band stated. Scott Crouse said that he always tried \\"to get the perfect blend of heaviness, imagery and listenability\\" and that these two albums were the first to \\"hit that mark\\". Salvation of Innocents included, in addition, some clean vocals that were compared by one reviewer to the sludge metal band Crowbar, as well as \\"some elements of European melodic metalcore\\" and faster songs. When asked what ten bands inspired Earth Crisis over the years in a 2016 interview, Scott Crouse named DYS, Judge, Corrosion of Conformity, Agnostic Front, Slayer, Sepultura, Metallica, Conviction, Zero Tolerance and Iron Maiden. Question: what is the most interesting part of this article, in your opinion?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The most interesting part of this article, in my opinion, is how Earth Crisis's music evolved over time, influenced by different styles and bands.

It's fascinating to see how their music changed while they still remained true to their core message and beliefs."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

We have an integer k, which is greater than 100 and less than 1200. 2. If the hundreds and the units digits of k are reversed, then k will become a new number. Let's represent the hundreds and units digits by h and u, respectively. So, k = 100h + 10t + u, where t is the tens digit. 3. When the hundreds and the units digits are reversed, the new number will be 100u + 10t + h. 4. The problem states that the resulting integer, when hundreds and units digits are reversed, is equal to k + 99. So, 100u + 10t + h = 100h + 10t + u + 99. Now, let's simplify and solve the equation: 100u + 10t + h - 100h - 10t - u = 99 99u - 99h = 99 u - h = 1 Now that we have a simplified equation (u - h = 1), let's evaluate the possible answers: Since k is between 100 and 1200, there are possibilities for hundreds digit (h) ranging from 1 to 11. Given u - h = 1, the units digit (u) will be one greater than the hundreds digit (h). For each of the hundreds digits from 1 to 11, there is a possibility of a single digit for units digit i.e u = h+1. The tens digit (t) can range from 0 to 9. Now, let's calculate the total number of possibilities: Number of possibilities for h = 11 (1 to 11) Number of possibilities for u = 1 (u = h+1) Number of possibilities for t = 10 (0 to 9) Total possibilities = 11 (h possibilities) * 1 (u possibilities) * 10 (t possibilities) = 110 However, we must remember that h can't be 11 (because it will result in a number greater than 1200). So, we have to subtract the additional possibilities, considering the case when h = 11: Additional possibilities when h = 11 = 1 (u possibility when h = 11) * 10 (t possibilities) = 10 Now, let's subtract the additional possibilities from the total possibilities: Final possibilities = 110 (total possibilities) - 10 (additional possibilities) = 100 Hence, the correct answer is e) 100."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the spring, reporting on terrorism surged dramatically. In chapter 8, we will explore this reporting and the ways agencies responded. These increasingly alarming reports, briefed to the President and top officials, became part of the context in which the new administration weighed its options for policy on al Qaeda. Except for a few reports that the CSG considered and apparently judged to be unreliable, none of these pointed specifically to possible al Qaeda action inside the United States-although the CSG continued to be concerned about the domestic threat. The mosaic of threat intelligence came from the Counterterrorist Center, which collected only abroad. Its reports were not supplemented by reports from the FBI. Clarke had expressed concern about an al Qaeda presence in the United States, and he worried about an attack on the White House by \\"Hizbollah, Hamas, al Qida and other terrorist organizations.\\" In May, President Bush announced that Vice President Cheney would himself lead an effort looking at preparations for managing a possible attack by weapons of mass destruction and at more general problems of national preparedness.

This is some data: Ariane 5, launchSite, ELA-3. Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided pertains to Ariane 5, a heavy-lift launch vehicle that is part of the Ariane rocket family. It also refers to the launch site ELA-3, which is short for Ensemble de Lancement Ariane 3. In this detailed description, we will delve into the history, development, technical specifications, and the primary launch site for Ariane 5. 1. Ariane 5: Ariane 5 is a European expendable launch system designed and developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Ariane Group, a joint venture of CNES and Airbus Defence and Space. It is the fifth generation of the Ariane rocket family and has been in service since 1996. The primary goals behind the development of Ariane 5 were to deliver increased payload capacity, improved reliability and cost efficiency, and be compatible with a broader range of missions. Ariane 5 is primarily used for launching communication satellites into geostationary transfer orbits (GTO), but is also capable of launching payloads to low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), polar orbits, and interplanetary missions. The Ariane 5 has two primary configurations: a. Ariane 5 ECA (Evolution Cryotechnique type A): This is the most powerful version of Ariane 5, with a payload capacity of up to 10.5 metric tons to GTO. b. Ariane 5 ES (Evolution Storable): This version is designed for various types of missions and has a slightly lower GTO payload capacity of up to 8 metric tons. 2. Technical Specifications: The Ariane 5 rocket is a two-stage vehicle, utilizing a cryogenic liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) main stage referred to as the EPC (Étage Principal Cryotechnique) and a solid rocket booster stage. - Main Stage: The EPC is equipped with the updated Vulcain 2 rocket engine. The main stage has a height of 30.5 meters and a diameter of 5.4 meters. It carries approximately 175 metric tons of LH2 and LOX as fuel. - Solid Rocket Boosters: Ariane 5 employs two solid rocket boosters (EAP - Étages d'Accélération à Poudre) that are connected to the EPC. Each booster is approximately 31.6 meters in height with a diameter of 3.06 meters. The combination of EPC and the two solid rocket boosters delivers efficient lift-off and stage separation, allowing for the transportation of heavy payloads into orbit. 3. Launch Site: ELA-3 Ensemble de Lancement Ariane 3, or ELA-3, is a dedicated launch facility for the Ariane 5 rocket located at the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana, near Kourou. The Guiana Space Center was chosen due to its proximity to the equator, which provides a performance advantage during launch, impeccable safety measures, and seclusion. ELA-3 was specifically designed and built for Ariane 5 operations starting in the 1990s. ELA-3 comprises several key elements for a successful Ariane 5 launch: a. The Launch Control Center (LCC): This houses the control systems and technical teams that oversee all pre-launch activities for the Ariane 5, from assembly to countdown sequences. b. Launcher Integration Building (BIL): The first stage of the integration process occurs here, including assembly of the main stage and the attachment of solid boosters. c. Final Assembly Building (BAF): The payload, spacecraft, and final integration occur in this building, after which the Ariane 5 is moved to the launch zone. d. The Launch Zone (ZL): This is the actual launch site, where the fully integrated Ariane 5 rocket is prepared for liftoff. In conclusion, the data provided, Ariane 5 and ELA-3 launch site, describes a highly efficient and reliable heavy-lift launch system designed for a wide range of space applications. Since its introduction, Ariane 5 has played a significant role in global space programs and is considered a cornerstone of European space efforts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. Who should break weight loss down into long term goals? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - The author. - The Mayo Clinic. - A dieter.

While the speaker does not explicitly state their beliefs about whether gerbils like to be handled, their explicit statement about their attitude towards gerbils offers a basis to infer their opinion on the hypothesis \\"I do not think gerbils like to be handled.\\" The speaker's description of gerbils being \\"kind of something you look at\\" can imply that they have a passive interaction approach with these animals. This may lead us to hypothesize that the speaker believes gerbils are not pets meant for handling. Their perspective on gerbils fits within the general attitude of the original hypothesis. At the same time, it is important to note that the premise does not provide concrete evidence regarding the speaker's opinion on gerbils' preference for handling. It merely gives us information about their personal approach to pet ownership, specifically focusing on gerbils as pets that may not require frequent human interaction. The speaker could be projecting their own preference for low-maintenance pets onto gerbils as a species, possibly indicating that their perspective is more about their personal desire for minimal interaction than it is about gerbils' handling preferences. In conclusion, the premise gives us an insight into the speaker's view on pet ownership and their perception of gerbils as pets more suitable for observation rather than handling. While this may partially align with the hypothesis \\"I do not think gerbils like to be handled,\\" specific information about the speaker's belief regarding gerbils' handling preferences is not provided.

The renal artery connects to capillaries inside the kidney. Capillaries and nephrons lie very close to each other in the kidney. Q: Blood flows into the kidney through which artery? A: Answer:","completion":"Blood flows into the kidney through the renal artery. The renal artery is a crucial component of the renal circulation system, which is responsible for the regulation of blood filtration and blood pressure within the kidneys. This artery branches off from the abdominal aorta and transports oxygen-rich blood into the kidney for filtration, reabsorption, and secretion processes. The renal artery then connects to the network of capillaries inside the kidney, which are closely associated with nephrons, the functional units of the kidneys responsible for filtration and urine formation. As the blood flows through the renal artery and into these capillaries, the kidneys efficiently extract waste products, excess water, and electrolytes from the blood, maintaining overall fluid balance and body homeostasis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Voters were asking. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Yes, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is also true. Both sentences essentially convey the same information, but with different structures. Let's analyze the two sentences to understand the similarities and subtle differences. Sentence 1: \\"Voters are already asking whether something is wrong with McCain.\\" This sentence is in the present continuous tense, indicating that the action (voters asking) is happening currently. It tells us that voters are in the process of asking if there is something wrong with McCain. The word \\"already\\" suggests that this is happening sooner than expected or previously anticipated. Sentence 2: \\"Is something wrong with McCain? Voters were asking.\\" The second sentence uses a different structure by first presenting the question (\\"Is something wrong with McCain?\\") and then describing who is asking it (\\"Voters were asking.\\"). This sentence is in the past continuous tense, indicating that the action of voters asking happened in the past but may still be ongoing. It provides a sense of duration to the situation. The use of \\"were\\" instead of \\"are\\" might seem to imply that the second sentence refers to a past event; however, it is well understood that past continuous tense can serve as a narrative technique to discuss events that may still be relevant or ongoing. The main difference between the two sentences is the tense and order in which the information is presented. Sentence 1 uses present continuous tense and presents the subject (voters) before the action (asking), whereas sentence 2 employs past continuous tense and first describes the action (the question) before identifying the subject (voters). Despite these differences in structure, both sentences express the point that voters are questioning if there is an issue with McCain. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence would also be considered true because the core information conveyed remains consistent between the two sentences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

John II, Count of Holland since 1299, also ruled over the County of Hainaut and the County of Zeeland, and was part of the House of Avesnes, the hereditary enemy of the Flemish House of Dampierre. Zealand had been contested between the Count of Flanders and the Count of Holland since the early 11th century and had become part of Holland by 1076. The Flemish invaded Hainaut in 1302 and conquered Lessines. Guy of Namur, son of the Count of Flanders, formed a fleet at Sluis and sailed on 23 April 1303 to claim Zeeland for the Flemish. After some initial successes, Guy was defeated on 10 and 11 August 1304 in the Battle of Zierikzee by a combined Franco-Hollandic fleet under Rainier Grimaldi, who had been sent by Philip IV of France to aid the Count of Holland. Guy of Namur was captured and Zeeland remained firmly in the hands of the Count of Holland. One week after this naval battle, on 18 August Philip IV himself fought the Flemish main army at the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle. This hard fought battle was inconclusive, but the death of William of Jülich and the serious material losses of the Flemish, made them sue for peace. After further minor battles, eventually the Treaty of Athis-sur-Orge was signed on 23 June 1305 which recognized Flemish independence, but at the cost of the cities of Lille, Douai and Orchies, which were transferred to France, and the paying of exorbitant fines to King Philip IV.

This article: Following the mixed success of their musical pursuits in the 1990s, U2 sought to simplify their sound; the Edge said that with Pop, the group had \\"taken the deconstruction of the rock 'n' roll band format to its absolute 'nth degree\\". For their tenth album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\". Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete Pop, the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.Released in October of that year, All That You Can't Leave Behind was seen by critics as a \\"back to basics\\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; Rolling Stone called it U2's \\"third masterpiece\\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12 million copies. Its lead single, \\"Beautiful Day\\", was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, while peaking at number 21 in the US. The song earned Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Record of the Year. At the awards ceremony, Bono declared that U2 were \\"reapplying for the job ... [of] the best band in the world\\".

What is the answer: In the Bible who was the husband of Bathsheba when she was first seen by David?","completion":"In the Bible, Bathsheba's husband when she was first seen by David was Uriah the Hittite, who was an elite soldier in King David's army. The story of David, Bathsheba, and Uriah can be found in the Old Testament in the book of 2 Samuel, specifically chapters 11 and 12. The story goes as follows: One evening, while King David was walking on the roof of his palace, he saw a beautiful woman bathing. This woman was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite. David was captivated by her beauty and sent for her, ultimately committing adultery with her, which resulted in her becoming pregnant. Seeking to cover up his sin, David summoned Uriah back from the battlefront, hoping that he would sleep with his wife, and the child would be assumed to be his. However, Uriah, being a loyal soldier, refused to indulge in the pleasures of his home while his comrades were still fighting on the front lines. Uriah slept at the entrance of the palace, not going home to his wife. Seeing that his plan had failed, David devised another scheme. He ordered his commander Joab to place Uriah at the forefront of the fiercest battle, essentially ensuring his death. Following David's orders, Joab placed Uriah in a position where he was ultimately killed by the enemy forces. Upon receiving news of Uriah's death, David married Bathsheba, and she gave birth to their son. However, the Lord was displeased with David's actions, and he sent the prophet Nathan to confront him. Nathan presented a parable of a rich man who stole a poor man’s only lamb to serve to his guest, though he possessed many lambs himself. David recognized the sin in the story and condemned the rich man's actions, only for Nathan to reveal that the rich man represented David himself in his treatment of Uriah and Bathsheba. David immediately repented for his sins, and Nathan delivered God's judgment: the child born of their adultery would die, and David's household would experience turmoil. The judgment came to pass, with the death of their child and ongoing conflict within David's family. Although Uriah the Hittite was Bathsheba's husband when she was first seen by David, the story serves as a lesson about the consequences of sin and the importance of repentance and seeking God's forgiveness. Despite their initial sins, David and Bathsheba later had another son, Solomon, who became one of Israel's greatest kings, highlighting the aspect of forgiveness and redemption in their story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His mother, Donna Gay (nee Wauthier), was Canadian, and his father, Richard Glover, was American. His paternal grandfather was English and his maternal step-grandfather was voice-over announcer Wayne Howell. His family was based in Brazil for many years due to his father's presidency of the South American division of Pepsi-Cola. Context: On February 23, 2008 Steve-O joined the rest of the Jackass crew for the Jackass MTV 24 Hour Takeover, which promoted JackassWorld.com. He participated in several stunts, and even debuted his rap music video which was executive produced by recording artist D-Jukes, leading to Mike Judge bringing back the duo of Beavis and Butt-head for the first time in years to criticize it. Later, during the live broadcast Steve-O was kicked out of MTV studios on the request of executives for his behavior and intoxication. On March 9, 2008, after receiving an e-mail from Steve-O that suggested his possible suicide, Steve-O's friends, including co-star Johnny Knoxville, became concerned he was a danger to himself and consulted with physician Dr. Drew Pinsky, who told them to get Steve-O to a hospital immediately. Steve-O was placed on a 72-hour psychiatric hold which was later lengthened to 14 days due to an alleged suicide attempt. In a mass e-mail addressed to his friends, Steve-O expressed that he previously had thought of his drug use and bipolarity as a \\"good thing\\", but that he now realizes that his drug use was apparently hurting those he loved most. On June 4, 2008, Steve-O pleaded guilty to felony possession of cocaine. He avoided jail by the successful completion of his treatment program. In July, after 115 days of sobriety, Steve-O announced he was \\"back in the loony bin\\". He returned to the mental institution, he said, because \\"I've had horrible mood swings and severe depression. My brain is fucked up from using so much cocaine, ketamine, PCP, nitrous oxide, and all sorts of other drugs.\\" Question: did he try to commit suicide. Whats the answer?","completion":"Steve-O, whose real name is Stephen Glover, did not explicitly attempt suicide; however, his behavior and a concerning email he sent to friends in March 2008 suggested that he could be a potential danger to himself. This email caused his friends, including Johnny Knoxville and Dr. Drew Pinsky, to worry about his well-being and the possibility of suicidal intentions. As a result, they decided to get Steve-O admitted to a hospital, where he was placed on a 72-hour psychiatric hold. This hold was later extended to 14 days due to concerns about an alleged suicide attempt. In an email addressed to his friends, Steve-O acknowledged that his drug use and bipolarity, which he had previously thought of as a \\"good thing,\\" were actually causing harm to the people he loved most. After he successfully completed a treatment program and pleaded guilty to felony possession of cocaine, Steve-O was dedicated to maintaining his sobriety. However, he later returned to a mental institution in July 2008, due to ongoing struggles with mood swings and severe depression. He attributed these challenges to the extensive use of various drugs, such as cocaine, ketamine, PCP, and nitrous oxide. To sum up, while there wasn't a clear-cut suicide attempt by Steve-O, his mental state and behaviors during that period raised significant concerns among his friends and led to his hospitalization and subsequent treatment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. What is most probably the case regarding why Trump did not make payment to the adult star directly? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. the payment was made without his knowledge B. not enough information C. he wanted this payment to remain private D. his lawyer insisted on handling all transfers of funds on behalf of his clients","completion":"C. he wanted this payment to remain private The reason behind choosing this option is that Trump reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the payment made to the adult film star.

Trump has denied the tryst but confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it.

Question: Who plan to retake the island? Movie title: The Rock Movie plot: On a rainy morning at Arlington National Cemetery, Brigadier General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) visits the grave of his wife, Barbara, who had recently passed away from an illness. He tells her that he misses her, but there is something he has to do now, and most of the world isn't going to like it. He hopes that wherever she is, she understands that he did what he had to do. After saying a final goodbye, he places his Medal of Honor on the headstone before he leaves.Later that night, Hummel leads a group of rogue Force Recon Marines on a raid of a Naval Weapons Depot. They seize a stockpile of rockets armed with weapons grade O-ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid, more commonly known as VX gas. They lose one of their men in the process, a horrific death caused by an accidental release of the chemical when one of the canisters was dropped and a sphere containing the deadly substance shatters.In an FBI lab in Washington DC, Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) is called in to inspect a package sent to Bosnian refugees. He and a trainee, Marv Isherwood (Todd Louiso), find a small doll inside that sprays them with sarin gas and contains a bomb made of C4 explosive that could destroy the lab and kill everyone in the building. As Stanley works frantically to disarm the bomb he turns down a hypodermic needle loaded with a dose of atropine. Stanley disarms the bomb successfully. At home that night, he relaxes until his girlfriend, Carla (Vanessa Marcil) arrives home. She tells him she's pregnant, and Stanley accepts her marriage proposal.Hummel is joined by other Marines who have served him over the course of his career; Major Tom Baxter (David Morse), who he served with in Vietnam, Captain Hendrix (John C. McGinley), who he served with in the Gulf, and Captains Frye (Gregory Sporleder) and Darrow (Tony Todd), who organized the raid on the weapons depot. They seize Alcatraz Island and take 81 tourists hostage, placing them in the prison cells, then threatening the FBI and Pentagon with launching the VX rockets against... A:","completion":"The retake of Alcatraz Island in the film \\"The Rock\\" is planned by a group of highly trained individuals, specifically the FBI, Navy SEALS, and an unlikely pair of experts. The film's plot revolves around Brigadier General Francis Hummel (played by Ed Harris), who leads a team of rogue Force Recon Marines in an act of domestic terrorism. They take over Alcatraz Island, with Hummel's motivations mainly centering on his dissatisfaction with the U.S. government's failure to properly honor and provide for military personnel who were killed in classified missions. In response to the situation on Alcatraz Island, the FBI director (played by John Spencer) sends in a team of Navy SEALS in an effort to infiltrate the island and neutralize the threat posed by Hummel and his team. Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (played by Nicolas Cage), a chemical weapons specialist, is also sent along with the SEALS to assist in disarming the deadly VX gas rockets. Additionally, a former Alcatraz inmate, John Patrick Mason (played by Sean Connery), is recruited to the team due to his expertise in the island's layout, as he is the only prisoner known to have successfully escaped the famous penitentiary. The plan to retake the island is both a combination of force and wit, as the expertise of the Navy SEALS, Goodspeed's knowledge on chemical weapons, and Mason's familiarity with the prison all serve as essential components for a successful mission. The team must navigate the various traps and obstacles placed on the island by Hummel and his rogue Marines while simultaneously keeping the hostages' safety and wellbeing in mind. As the plot unfolds, tensions within Hummel's group arise, and their united front gradually crumbles. Goodspeed and Mason face numerous challenges in their efforts to defuse the rockets, rescue hostages, and prevent the catastrophe of widespread VX gas exposure to the population of San Francisco. The film culminates in a confrontation between the protagonists and Hummel's remaining loyal soldiers. In conclusion, the retake of Alcatraz Island in \\"The Rock\\" is planned and executed by the FBI, Navy SEALS, Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (a chemical weapons expert), and John Patrick Mason (a former Alcatraz inmate). The team works together with a common goal of saving the hostages, disarming the deadly VX gas rockets, and reclaiming Alcatraz Island from Hummel's rogue Marines. The film offers a thrilling and dramatic narrative that highlights the importance of teamwork, expertise, and determination in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gregory James \\"Greg\\" LeMond (born June 26, 1961) is an American former professional road racing cyclist who won the Road Race World Championship twice (1983 and 1989) and the Tour de France three times (1986, 1989 and 1990). He is also an entrepreneur and anti-doping advocate. LeMond was born in Lakewood, California, and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, near Reno. He is married and has three children with his wife Kathy, with whom he supports a variety of charitable causes and organizations. In 1990, LeMond founded LeMond Bicycles to develop machines for himself that would also be marketed and sold to the public. The following year, searching for an equipment edge for Team Z at the 1991 Tour de France, LeMond concluded an exclusive licensing agreement between his company and Carbonframes, Inc., to access the latter's advanced composites technology. While LeMond briefly led the 1991 Tour overall, riding his Carbonframes-produced \\"Greg LeMond\\" bicycle, the company eventually faltered, something LeMond blamed on \\"under-capitalization\\" and poor management by his father. Carbonframes and LeMond Cycles \\"parted amiably two years later.\\" In 1995, with his company allegedly nearly bankrupt, LeMond reached a licensing-agreement with Trek Bicycle Corporation, according to which the Wisconsin-based company would manufacture and distribute bicycles designed with LeMond that would be sold under the \\"LeMond Bicycles\\" brand. LeMond would later claim that going into business with Trek \\"destroyed\\" his relationship with his father. The lucrative partnership, which generated revenue for Trek in excess of 100,000,000 USD, would be renewed several times over the course of 13 years, but it ultimately ended in acrimony after LeMond's relationship with Trek deteriorated over his staunch anti-doping advocacy. The two parties first found themselves at odds in July 2001, after LeMond expressed public concern over the relationship between Italian doping doctor Michele Ferrari and Trek's star athlete, Lance Armstrong. \\"When I heard he was working with Michele Ferrari, I was devastated,\\" LeMond was quoted as saying of Armstrong. \\"If Lance is clean, it is the greatest comeback in the history of sports. If he isn't, it would be the greatest fraud.\\" Trek's president John Burke pressured LeMond to apologize, claiming, \\"Greg's public comments hurt the LeMond brand and the Trek brand.\\" Burke allegedly justified his demand for an apology by advising that, \\"As a contractual partner, he [LeMond] could criticize doping only generally - not point his finger at specific athletes, particularly one that happens to be the company's main cash cow.\\" In April 2008, Trek announced that it was dropping LeMond Bicycles from its product line and would sue to sever the licensing agreement. It quickly emerged that in March 2008, LeMond had filed a complaint against Trek for breach of contract, claiming that they had not made a \\"best efforts\\" attempt to sell his bicycles, as well as describing attempts to 'silence' him about doping, including incidents in 2001 and 2004. His complaint included statistics detailing slow sales in some markets, including the fact that between September 2001 and June 2007, Trek only sold 10,393 worth of LeMond bikes in France, a country in which LeMond was both famous and popular. As promised, Trek counter-sued and stopped producing bicycles under the LeMond brand. After nearly two years of litigation, in February 2010, LeMond reached an out-of-court settlement with Trek in their breach-of-contract dispute, the terms of which were confidential. The settlement permitted the case to be dismissed with prejudice, meaning, \\"neither side can produce the same claims against one another in a future lawsuit.\\" And although settlement terms were not disclosed, LeMond reportedly obtained full control over the LeMond Bicycles name, while Trek made a donation of 200,000 USD to the charity 1in6, of which LeMond was a founding member of the board of directors.

How will the movement of these foods between European countries be regulated? Translate to Romanian","completion":"Reglementarea mișcării acestor produse alimentare între țările europene va implica o combinație de reguli și reglementări, acorduri comerciale, controale și mecanisme de monitorizare. Un astfel de cadru complex are ca scop promovarea unui comerț sigur, eficient și durabil între țările europene. Trebuie să se ițe cont de mai mulți factori, inclusiv de calitatea alimentelor, siguranța alimentară, taxele vamale și standardele de mediu. 1. Regulile și reglementările la nivel național și regional: În primul rând, țările europene au propriile lor legi și reglementări în ceea ce privește producția și distribuția produselor alimentare. Producătorii și distribuitorii de produse alimentare trebuie să respecte aceste reglementări locale atunci când transportă alimente între țări. Acest lucru poate implica verificări ale calității și standardelor de igienă, precum și teste pentru prezența contaminanților și reziduuri de pesticide. 2. Piața internă a Uniunii Europene: Pentru statele membre ale Uniunii Europene, mișcarea produselor alimentare între țări este facilitată de piața internă a UE, care vizează facilitarea comerțului în cadrul blocului comercial. Piața internă promovează armonizarea legislației alimentare și eliminarea barierelor comerciale, precum taxele vamale și restricțiile cantitative. Statele membre trebuie să se conformeze standardelor comune ale UE în ceea ce privește calitatea și siguranța alimentară, etichetarea produselor și protecția mediului înconjurător. 3. Acordurile comerciale: În afara pieței interne, comerțul cu produse alimentare între țările europene poate fi reglementat prin acorduri comerciale bilaterale sau multilaterale, care stabilesc condițiile și regulile de acces la piață, taxele vamale și alte cerințe specifice. Acest tip de acorduri ajută la promovarea comerțului între țările europene și la facilitarea accesului la marile piețe regionale. 4. Controale și mecanisme de monitorizare: Pentru a asigura respectarea regulilor și reglementărilor și pentru a proteja siguranța consumatorilor, țările europene au instituit diverse controale și mecanisme de monitorizare. Acestea pot include: - Controalele la frontieră: Aceste controale sunt efectuate la punctele de intrare în țară pentru a verifica dacă produsele alimentare îndeplinesc standardele de calitate și siguranță, precum și pentru a asigura respectarea reglementărilor vamale și fiscale. De exemplu, produsele alimentare care intră în UE sunt supuse controlului și verificării din partea autorităților vamale și de siguranță a alimentelor. - Sistemul rapid de alertă pentru produse alimentare și furaje (RASFF): Acest sistem facilitează schimbul de informații între autoritățile de siguranță a alimentelor din statele membre ale UE, atunci când se identifică un risc pentru sănătatea publică legat de un produs alimentar sau furaj. Acesta permite țărilor să ia măsuri rapide și coordonate pentru a proteja sănătatea consumatorilor și a preveni răspândirea contaminanților sau a bolilor. - Auditurile și inspecțiile: Acestea sunt efectuate pentru a verifica conformitatea producătorilor de alimente și a distribuitorilor cu regulile și reglementările aferente, precum și pentru a evalua eficacitatea sistemelor de control al siguranței alimentelor la nivel național și regional. Prin urmare, reglementarea mișcării produselor alimentare între țările europene implică o abordare integrată și adaptabilă care combină diferite instrumente și mecanisme pentru a garanta un comerț sigur și durabil și pentru a proteja sănătatea consumatorilor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Joseph had many more pet bunny rabbits than Kyle because","completion":"Joseph had a deep-seated love for animals, particularly bunny rabbits. This had grown from his early years, when he was first introduced to these delightful creatures by his grandmother during his visits to her countryside home. Joseph's connection with rabbits was not merely for their fluffiness or charming dispositions but went deeper, primarily towards their unique personalities and behaviors that he found fascinating and heartwarming. In contrast, Kyle was less of an animal enthusiast and more of a practical character. He kept a few rabbits, largely due to societal pressure and as a means to teach his children about responsibility. His involvement with them was not as immersive, nor as romantic, as Joseph's. Kyle's rabbits were well-taken care of, but the quantity and variety were much less than that of Joseph's. The reason was simple - Kyle saw these pets more as a duty or obligation rather than companions to cherish. Joseph’s affinity for rabbits manifested itself in several ways that led to his larger collection. Initially, Joseph began by adopting rabbits from local shelters, rescuing them from poor living conditions. He devoted a significant portion of his backyard to create a bunny haven, a space designed specifically to suit their needs. Thanks to his meticulous research, the space was safe and comfortably equipped with necessary amenities such as a variety of foods rabbits eat, several mini hutches for shelter and resting, and open areas for them to play and exercise. With time, Joseph's involvement in the local rabbit communities escalated. He began attending rabbit shows, participating in online groups, and fostering close friendships with fellow rabbit enthusiasts who shared his passion. It was not long before Joseph became a well-known figure to local breeders and sometimes was given the privilege to adopt special breeds. Joseph’s dedication extended beyond simply housing the rabbits. He invested time in studying rabbit care, even undertaking a basic veterinary course to understand their health better. He prepared their meals with a precision that represented his understanding of their dietary needs, ensuring each meal was a healthy blend of hay, fruits, vegetables, and rabbit pellets. Joseph also took the time to interact with each rabbit individually to keep them mentally stimulated. His rabbits were given names that represented their unique personalities, and he spent countless hours observing them interact, memorizing their individual behaviors, traits, preferences, and even their dislikes. They were not merely pets to him; they were his little companions, each with a unique personality and a special place in his heart. To sum up, Joseph had many more bunny rabbits than Kyle because his love extended beyond just owning pets. His respect, dedication, and understanding of these animals were profound, evident from his commitment to their care and well being. From rescue missions to providing a safe haven, engaging with rabbit communities to adopting special breeds, Joseph's actions were fuelled by his deep love for bunnies. Unlike Kyle, for whom rabbits were more of a responsibility, Joseph saw them as a meaningful part of his life, each rabbit adding a new dimension to his vernacular of joy and companionship. Their numbers kept on adding, not because he wanted to boast of more, but because his heart had made space for yet another fluffy friend."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: Rommel is a mechanic and what kind of racer? Movie title: Sidehackers Movie plot: The film centers on Rommel, a mechanic and sidehack-style racer, who turns down the offer of J.C., a hot-tempered entertainer, to join his act after J.C. witnesses a sidehack race for the first time. During this time, J.C.'s abused girlfriend, Paisley, falls for Rommel and attempts to seduce him. He rejects her advances and sends her away crying. Later, when J.C. and his crew return to their hotel, they find Paisley drunk and her clothes tattered, claiming that Rommel raped her. Angered, J.C. and his gang beat Rommel unconscious and kill his fiancee, Rita. Rommel then spends the rest of the movie plotting his revenge against J.C., who goes into hiding from the police. The film's end is nihilistic in nature. After both Rommel and J.C.'s men have killed each other (while two of Rommel's men escaped on a sidehack bike), the two men brawl. When Rommel manages to gain the upper hand, he elects to walk away when the police are about to arrive, but J.C. picks up a gun and shoots Rommel from behind.

Mr Hu said that the flight had not been timed to coincide with Mr Gates' visit, the US defence secretary said. The US is currently the only nation with a fully operational stealth plane. But both Russia and China are known to be working on prototypes of stealth fighters, which are invisible to radar. Mr Gates' three-day visit to Beijing comes amid US concern over the speed at which China's military is modernising and upgrading its technology. \\"I asked President Hu about it directly, and he said that the test had absolutely nothing to do with my visit and had been a pre-planned test. And that's where we left it,\\" Mr Gates was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. By Shirong ChenBBC China Editor Before the official confirmation from the president, pictures reportedly taken by fighter jet spotters had appeared on all major Chinese web portals, including the state-run Xinhua news agency. There is also a video clip showing the stealth fighter taxi-ing, taking off and landing, accompanied by a trainer jet, with fans chatting and shouting \\"magnificent\\". The spotters have been camped out near the fighter jet design institute in Chengdu, in south-west China. They have dubbed the prototype \\"Black Ribbon\\", meaning black 4th generation fighter. They also say that Xi Jinping, China's Vice-President and Vice-Chairman of the Military Commission, visited the airfield on Saturday, presumably to witness a test flight that was aborted due to bad weather. Leaked images of what was said to be China's J-20 fighter first appeared earlier this month during taxi tests at the Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute. On Tuesday, the plane took off and flew for about 15 minutes, according to eyewitness accounts published on unofficial Chinese web portals. A video clip of the flight was also posted on the web. China says it expects the stealth plane to be operational some time between 2017 and 2019. But earlier this month the Pentagon played down concerns over the fighter. \\"Developing a stealth capability with a prototype and then integrating that into a combat environment is going to take some time,\\" said US director of naval intelligence Vice Admiral David Dorsett. China's official military budget quadrupled between 1999 and 2009 as the country's economy grew. In 2010 it stood at 78bn (Â£50bn). But the US has by far the largest defence budget in the world at just over 700bn.

Eventually the police were lucky Japanese police have captured a fugitive who had eluded authorities for weeks in a bizarre drama that gripped the country. Tatsuma Hirao, 27, had made a run for it from an open prison in the town of Imabari. Police deployed more than 6,000 officers on the small island of Mukaishima, using everything from dogs to helicopters and drones. He was caught at a train station in Hiroshima, about 70km (40 miles) away. Hirao was not considered a dangerous criminal. Serving five and a half years for theft, he was being held at a facility where inmates are free to walk about without walls or fences. The system did not work in the case of Hirao. The first clues following his getaway were on Mukaishima. On the face of it, the 22 sq km (8.5 sq mile) island of 22,000 people should not have been an easy place to hide. Image copyright Kyodo News Image caption Police officers search properties on Mukaishima Yet despite using helicopters, sniffer dogs and drones, Hirao kept eluding his pursuers. All the police found were small clues: fingerprints, items like socks or mobile phones thought to have been stolen by the fugitive or even just rubbish from the food he ate. When he stole a car, he left a note assuring the owner that \\"I'm borrowing your car but I'll never damage it\\". The story created a nationwide media frenzy about how one person could outsmart police week after week. The country's justice minister had to apologise publicly for failing to find the fugitive. You might also be interested in: One reason for the failure might have been that Mukaishima has around 1,000 unoccupied holiday homes scattered around the hilly, forested landscape.

Tatsuma Hirao escaped from a low-security prison in Ehime prefecture on April 8 during a work assignment while serving a 5 ½ year sentence for theft. The escape caused anxiety in the region and attracted national attention. After escaping, he allegedly drove a stolen car along a highway connecting several islands. Police believe he arrived on the island of Mukaishima, where more than 1,000 police searched for him daily. They said his fingerprints were detected at the scenes of several reported thefts of clothes and food after the jailbreak. Hirao, 27, was arrested Monday after being spotted walking on a street in Hiroshima after an internet cafe reportedly notified police that a man resembling him visited. In a video of the arrest broadcast on TV Asahi, a man identified as Hirao tried to climb over a concrete wall to escape, but was pulled down, thrown to the ground and seized by several policemen. The island has abundant places to hide. It has about 1,000 houses made vacant by an aging and shrinking population and is also only 200 meters (yards) from the Hiroshima coast. Media reports say Hirao told police that he swam from Mukaishima to a city in Hiroshima prefecture to escape the manhunt, then took a train west to Hiroshima city. Hirao said he hid in vacant houses while on the island, but became tired of evading police, public broadcaster NHK reported. Hirao was arrested in 2013 for a series of robberies in southern Japan. Japan has a relatively low crime rate, and prison escapes are rare. Its population is declining and the average age is rising quickly. ___ Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi Find her work at https://www.apnews.com/search/mari%20yamaguchi |||||Summary:","completion":"Japanese fugitive Tatsuma Hirao, 27, who evaded capture for weeks during a bizarre and heavily publicized manhunt, was eventually caught by police in Hiroshima after making a daring escape from an open prison in the town of Imabari.

'Savagely compromised version of the original hardware': Nintendo is set to launch its Wii Mini in the UK next month, but the slimmed down version of their last-generation console has already been savaged by video gamers In a statement today, Nintendo said: 'With a family-friendly design offering no internet capabilities, OPTIONS: - British allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched. - Canada allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched. - Damien Gayle allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched. - Japanese allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched. - Mini allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched. - Nintendo allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched. - UK allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched. - Wii allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched. - Wii Mini allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched. - Wii U allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched.","completion":"Wii Mini allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched. Explanation: Other options are incorrect because: - British, Canada, Damien Gayle, Japanese, and UK are all unrelated to the actual console being discussed. - Mini is just a descriptive term for the smaller version of the console, but not the actual name of the console. - Nintendo is the company that created the Wii Mini, not the console itself. - Wii and Wii U are different consoles from the Wii Mini, so they are not the correct answer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose third Benhardt play was La Tosca?

Although the reviewer begins the text with a moderately positive tone, recounting a promising first visit with an appreciation for the quality of the fettuccine, the narrative progressively transitions into a fairly strong negative sentiment. At the beginning of the review, the sentiment is mixed due to the perceived discrepancy between the main dish and its sides; the reviewer seems somewhat confused about the unusual combination of having potato-based sides (french fries or mashed potatoes) with pasta like fettuccine. As such, skepticism appears right from the beginning, casting a certain level of criticism toward the restaurant's culinary appropriateness. In the middle of the review, there's a marked negative shift. The sentiment turns quite negative when the reviewer discusses the second visit. The use of the interjection \\"Yikes\\" underlines a strong disapproval of the apparently diminished food quality. The once-praised fettuccine is now deemed \\"bland,\\" implying disappointment and failed expectations after the initial positive experience. The insignificance of the chef factor (by revealing that it was the same chef) seems to boost the reviewer's confusion and dissatisfaction. Finally, the review concludes with an unequivocally negative sentiment. The husband's dish, a spaghetti, is harshly criticized as being \\"so salty he could not finish it.\\" This remark underscores a severe lapse in the restaurant's food quality management, enhancing the overall negative sentiment in the review. Also, the reviewer's definite decision not to return to the restaurant and the feeling of wasting money show a profound discontentment. They are distressed by the restaurant's perceived inability to maintain consistency and quality, thereby firmly anchoring the overall negative sentiment of the review. Indeed, the sentiment is not only negative toward the food quality but also the restaurant's management, as the reviewer indicates their disappointment in the establishment's seeming unawareness or inability to correct their inconsistent performance. This review, thus, potentially warns prospective diners about these qualities or lack thereof."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The film is based on actual events, beginning in August 1941. Nazi Einsatzgruppen (task forces) are sweeping through Eastern Europe, systematically killing Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader. An arrangement is made between the two groups in which the Soviet partisans agree to protect the Jewish camp in exchange for supplies.

Antonio Ramiro Romo (born April 21, 1980) is an American football television analyst and former quarterback who played 14 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Eastern Illinois University, where he won the Walter Payton Award in 2002, and led the Panthers to an Ohio Valley Conference championship in 2001. He signed as an undrafted free agent with the Cowboys in 2003. Beginning his career as a holder, Romo became the Cowboys' starting quarterback during the 2006 season. Romo began the 2007 season with four touchdown passes and an additional touchdown rush, the first of his career, defeating the New York Giants 45-35 in the Cowboys' first game of the regular season, His 345 passing yards in Week 1 led the NFL. In Week 2, he threw for 186 yards and two touchdowns beating the Miami Dolphins, ranking him seventh in passing yards and tied for second with six touchdown passes. Romo added 329 passing yards and two touchdown passes in the Cowboys' Week 3 34-10 win over the Chicago Bears. The following week, he passed for 339 yards and three touchdowns in a 35-7 win over the St. Louis Rams. He also ran for an additional touchdown. This brought his season totals to 1199 passing yards with 11 passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns. In Week 5, on Monday Night Football against the Buffalo Bills, Romo threw five interceptions (four in the first half, two of which were returned for touchdowns) and lost a fumble. He became the second person in the history of Monday Night Football to throw five interceptions in a winning effort. The first person was his quarterbacks coach Wade Wilson. Nonetheless, he threw for 4,211 yards (third in the NFL) and 36 touchdown passes during the regular season (second only to Tom Brady). His 97.4 passer rating was good enough for fifth in the NFL behind Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, David Garrard, and Peyton Manning. On October 29, Romo reached an agreement to a six-year, 67.5 million contract extension with the Cowboys. On November 29 against the Green Bay Packers, in a game between 10-1 teams, Romo threw four touchdown passes (bringing his season total to 33), breaking Danny White's (29) record from 1983. On December 22 against the Carolina Panthers, Romo became the first Cowboys' quarterback to pass for more than 4,000 yards in a season. Finally on December 30 against the Washington Redskins, Romo broke the Cowboys' season completions record with his 335th completion, a short pass to tight end Jason Witten. The Cowboys finished the season with a 13-3 record. In the Cowboys' January 13, 2008, divisional playoff game against the New York Giants, Romo was unable to lead his team to a come-from-behind victory. On fourth down with less than half a minute and no timeouts left, Romo threw the ball into the end zone, but it was intercepted by Giants cornerback R. W. McQuarters, ensuring that the Cowboys were eliminated from the playoffs with a 21-17 loss to the eventual Super Bowl XLII champions. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did they won with Green Bay Packers in November 29?","completion":"Yes, they did win! The passage says, \\"On November 29 against the Green Bay Packers, in a game between 10-1 teams, Romo threw four touchdown passes\\".

A toddler has a rare condition that makes his skin so dry he can't blink. Daniel Maples, who is 18 months-old, was born with lamellar ichthyosis - which affects just one in 600,000 people - and causes the skin to become thickened and cracked. The top layer of his skin sheds six times faster than normal - leaving a thick, scale-like build-up of skin underneath. Daniel Maples, 18 months old, has a rare, genetic condition which causes his skin to thicken and crack. The top layer of Daniel's skin sheds six times faster than normal - leaving a thick, scale-like build-up. His parents Steve Maples, 29 and Emma Holby, 23, have to smother him in medical jelly like Vaseline every four hours to stop his delicate skin from cracking. Mr Maples, a recruiter from Maldon, Essex, said: ‘The skin is thick and it peels off and it takes about two months to completely come off. ‘Over time he now has to be creamed every four to six hours each day and every three hours throughout the night. ‘It’s a very high maintenance condition and he also requires two or three showers a day as well as eye drops because he doesn’t blink. ‘He’s been in and out of hospital with skin infections because of the condition. ‘It will continue throughout his life and there’s no cure for it. When he is older he’ll have to do it all himself.’ Daniel's parents have to apply cream to his skin every four hours during the day and every three hours throughout the night. He is pictured with his mother, Emma Holby. There is no cure for Daniel's condition so as he gets older he will have to learn to manage it himself. He is pictured with his father, Steve Maples. He added: ‘Emma and I were just unlucky that we both had the gene. There is a one in four chance any children we have will get it. ‘As long as he’s been brought up right and it’s not an issue he will be alright. ‘It’s one of those things, he’s just a bit different. He’s a very happy child and as long as we teach him to be confident about himself I don’t see why he can’t lead a normal life.’ Lamellar ichthyosis, which develops when a child inherits an abnormal gene from both parents, speeds up the skin cell turnover. The word ichthyosis comes from the ancient Greek word for fish - because the cracked skin is said to resemble the scales on a fish. Daniel does not blink so he has to be given eye drops regularly so his eyes don't dry out. Throughout his life, Daniel has been in and out of hospital with skin infections. Image (right) shows him in hospital being treated with a Vaseline-like jelly. Problems associated with the condition include overheating, where a person’s thick skin prevents them from sweating, and eye problems caused by the tightness of the skin. Some children get ‘constriction bands’ which mean they have tight bands of skin around their fingers or toes which can prevent proper blood circulation. Severe scaling of the skin on the scalp can also lead to patchy loss of hair. Daniel’s parents are hoping to raise money for The Ichthyosis Support Group, and have so far raised £2,900 towards the fight for a cure. Anyone wishing to donate can do so by clicking here. Lamellar ichthyosis is a very rare skin condition characterised by abnormal scaling and shedding of the skin. It is believed to occur in one in every 600,000 people and symptoms usually appear within the first few days of life. Sufferers tend to have plate-like scales of skin which often appear brownish in colour. The condition is caused by genetic abnormalities that affect the shedding of skin. It occurs when both of a person's parents carry the abnormal gene - in this situation, there is a one in four chance of the person developing the condition. Lamellar ichthyosis can also cause overheating as it prevents sweating, and can constrict the blood flow to the fingers and toes as it causes the skin tighten. It can also cause eye problems, hair loss, and difficulty bending the hand joints. There is currently no cure and the key treatment is regularly applying moisturiser.

Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, (; 18 May 1872 – 2 February 1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic, political activist and Nobel laureate. At various points in his life he considered himself a liberal, a socialist, and a pacifist, but he also admitted that he had \\"never been any of these things, in any profound sense\\". He was born in Monmouthshire into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom. In the early 20th century, Russell led the British \\"revolt against idealism\\". He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege, colleague G. E. Moore, and protégé Ludwig Wittgenstein. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier logicians. With A. N. Whitehead he wrote \\"Principia Mathematica\\", an attempt to create a logical basis for mathematics. His philosophical essay \\"On Denoting\\" has been considered a \\"paradigm of philosophy\\". His work has had a considerable influence on mathematics, logic, set theory, linguistics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computer science (see type theory and type system), and philosophy, especially the philosophy of language, epistemology, and metaphysics. Russell was a prominent anti-war activist; he championed anti-imperialism. Occasionally, he advocated preventive nuclear war, before the opportunity provided by the atomic monopoly had passed, and \\"welcomed with enthusiasm\\" world government. He went to prison for his pacifism during World War I. Later, he concluded war against Adolf Hitler was a necessary \\"lesser of two evils\\". He criticized Stalinist totalitarianism, attacked the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War, and was an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What genres are defined chiefly by lyrical focus? ? The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly...

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given text for US Congressional and California state bills, your task is to generate a summary for this bill. Q: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \`\`Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, Milk, and Cheese To Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday Act'' or the \`\`DAIRY PRIDE Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) Dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet for both children and adults, according to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (referred to in this section as the \`\`Dietary Guidelines'') published by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture. The Dietary Guidelines state that most Americans are not meeting recommended intake for the dairy food group. Consumption of dairy foods provides numerous health benefits, including lowering the risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. (2) The Dietary Guidelines state that dairy foods are excellent sources of critical nutrients for human health, including vitamin D, calcium, and potassium, all of which are under consumed by people of the United States. When consumed in the amounts recommended by the Food Patterns of the Department of Agriculture, on average across the calorie levels, dairy foods contribute about 67 percent of calcium, 64 percent of vitamin D, and 17 percent of magnesium. (3) About 30 percent of adolescent boys meet or exceed the recommended 3-cup equivalents per day, but less than 10 percent of adolescent females meet or exceed this recommendation. An age-related decline in dairy intake appears to begin in adolescence and intakes persist at very low levels among adult females across the age distribution. Less than 5 percent of adult females consume the recommended 3-cup equivalents per day. Overall, more than 80 percent of the entire population of the United States does not meet the daily dairy intake recommendation. (4) The Dietary Guidelines state that vitamin D and potassium amounts vary across plant-based milk alternatives. The amount of calcium per calorie is lower for most plant-based alternative milk products. To obtain the amount of calcium contained in one cup of non-fat fluid milk from a plant-based milk alternative, the portion size and calorie intake must be greater. (5) Imitation dairy products, such as plant-based products derived from rice, nuts, soybeans, hemp, coconut, algae, and other foods that imitate milk, yogurt, and cheese, often do not provide the same nutrition content as real milk, cheese, and yogurt derived from dairy cows. (6) Plant-based products labeled as milk are misleading to consumers. (7) The Food and Drug Administration has regulations that define milk and cream as the \`\`lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows'' (section 131.110 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations). This definition further applies to milk used to create other dairy products, including yogurt and cheese, as specified in sections 131 and 133 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations. (8) Given the proliferation of plant-based products in the marketplace that are mislabeled as milk despite the standard of identity defined for this substance, enforcement by the Food and Drug Administration against these practices should be improved to avoid misleading consumers.

(b) Guidance.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall-- (1) not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, issue draft guidance on how enforcement of the amendment made by subsection (a) will be carried out; and (2) not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, issue final guidance on such enforcement. (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall report to Congress on enforcement actions taken under paragraph (z) of section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343), as amended by this Act, including warnings issued pursuant to such paragraph and penalties assessed under section 303 of such Act (21 U.S.C. 333) with respect to such paragraph.

He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is endangered when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death-threatening postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill lurks around Kahane's home and is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi), whom he watches while talking to her on the phone, that Kahane is at a showing of 'The Bicycle Thief'. Mill goes to the theater, pretending to recognize Kahane in the lobby after the film, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar and have some drinks. Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mills offer; he calls Mill a liar, pointing out that he knows Mill didn't really go to the theater to see 'The Bicycle Thief' because Kahane saw Mill wander in late and only catch the last five minutes of it, and denies responsibility for sending Mill the postcards. Kahane continues goading Mill about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot the two men fight. Mill loses his balance and falls, and feeling threatened, kills Kahane, then makes the death look like a robbery gone wrong.The next day, Mill receives another postcard.

Article:The Palestinian Authority's Al-Hayat-al-Jadida also denied that the drawing - of a robed figure standing over the Earth - represented the Prophet. Most Muslims view any depictions of the Prophet as forbidden - and offensive. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has ordered an inquiry into the publication of the cartoon. The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, said Mr Abbas had called for \\"deterrent action against those responsible for this terrible mistake\\". Mr Abbas was among the world leaders who attended a rally in Paris last month to condemn a deadly gun attack on the offices of a satirical magazine that had caricatured Muhammad. The gunmen - both of whom had links to jihadist militants - killed prominent journalists at the Charlie Hebdo magazine, in apparent retaliation for the caricatures. The attack sparked a global debate over freedom of expression and its limits. Al-Hayat-al-Jadida published a drawing in its 1 February edition that featured a robed figure standing over the Earth, scattering seeds from a heart-shaped bag. The caption to the drawing said, \\"Our Prophet Muhammad\\". The cartoonist, Mohammed Sabanneh, later wrote on his Facebook page that he had not meant any harm by the drawing, Reuters news agency reported. Mr Sabanneh said the robed figure did not represent the Prophet but was \\"a symbol of humanity enlightened by what the Prophet Muhammad brought\\". Along with its apology, the West Bank-based newspaper announced that it had launched an inquiry into \\"the published drawing that led to the misunderstanding\\". The paper emphasised that the \\"the intention behind the publication of the image was to defend religions and to spread love and peace\\".

In the first quarter, Baltimore took flight first with kicker Matt Stover getting a 21-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Ravens increased its lead with Stover getting a 28-yard field goal. The Cardinals would respond with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 48-yard field goal.

Space: With more kids, the need for space increases. Children need rooms for sleeping, playing, and studying. A larger house provides the required space for various activities, promoting a healthy living environment. 2. Privacy: As children grow older, they require personal space and privacy. A larger house will provide separate rooms and areas for kids to have their privacy, contributing positively to their development. 3. Storage: More kids mean more clothes, toys, books, and other belongings. A larger house will offer more storage options, helping to keep everything organized and avoid clutter. 4. Family time and entertainment: A larger house typically has more communal areas, like a bigger living room or family room. This allows the family to spend quality time together while still having enough space for different activities and interests. 5. Accommodating guests: A larger house provides additional space for hosting guests, allowing friends and extended family members to visit comfortably. This can be particularly important if you have a large family or frequently invite friends over. 6. Potential for growth: As the family continues to grow, there may be additional life changes that require more space, such as elderly family members moving in, or housing a home office or business. Having a larger house provides the flexibility needed to adapt to these changes. In conclusion, a larger house is the most fitting choice to accommodate the various necessities that arise from having more kids. A home that meets the space, privacy, storage, and entertainment needs of an expanding family will significantly contribute to a fulfilling and harmonious living environment."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back.

Fun Lovin' Criminals are a band from New York City. Their musical style is eclectic, covering styles such as hip hop, rock, blues, jazz, R&B, punk, and funk. They are best known for their hit \\"Scooby Snacks\\", which features samples from films by Quentin Tarantino, and the song \\"Love Unlimited\\", which recalls Barry White's backing vocal group. Their songs often focus on life in New York City, as well as urban life in general. The band was formed in 1993 by Huey Morgan, Brian \\"Fast\\" Leiser and Steve Borgovini after Leiser, who was already friends with Borgovini, met Morgan at the club where they both worked. They started playing together and would provide the entertainment for the club when a booked act failed to show up. It was during one of these stand-in gigs that they came to the attention of EMI and they were offered a record deal. Come Find Yourself, the band's first album, was released in the summer of 1996 by Chrysalis Records and followed their single \\"The Grave And The Constant\\" (UK No. 72), which was released a month earlier, into the UK charts. The album also featured the UK Top 40 hits, \\"Scooby Snacks\\" (UK No. 22), \\"The Fun Lovin' Criminal\\" (UK No. 26) and \\"King Of New York\\" (UK No. 28). The subject of latter touched on the imprisonment of Italian-American mafioso John Gotti, the wannabe gangsters emulating his style, and his fans and followers in his community that maintained his innocence. The biggest hit, \\"Scooby Snacks\\", features samples from films by Quentin Tarantino and a guitar sample from Tones On Tail song \\"Movement of Fear\\", interspersed with rap verses and a sung, anthemic, chorus. Come Find Yourself had a slow rise up the UK Albums Chart, finally peaking at No. 7 and spending well over a year in the chart, however it failed to make any impact in the US. The success of the album prompted the re-release of \\"Scooby Snacks\\" as a single, alongside a cover of the 10cc classic \\"I'm Not In Love\\", which this time reached UK No. 12. 100% Colombian, released in August 1998 by Virgin Records, had a far grittier sound to it tempered by three upbeat songs, and several downtempo tracks, including \\"Love Unlimited\\", a tribute to Barry White. \\"Korean Bodega\\", one of the aforementioned upbeat songs, was the biggest hit from the album, reaching No. 15, their second-highest placing single so far after the re-release of \\"Scooby Snacks\\". In June 1999 the band played at Glastonbury Festival on the Pyramid Stage. Their December 1999 album Mimosa, released by EMI was a compilation album consisting mostly of laid back lounge style covers and different versions of earlier released tracks. While making reasonable sales, the album was their weakest selling album yet and remained so for some years. It was around this time, in 1999, that Steve Borgovini left the band. He was replaced by Maxwell \\"Mackie\\" Jayson.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: and the situation: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B. Answer the following question: Which case would see slower movement, case A or case C? A:","completion":"Between case A (Mars) and case C (Jupiter), case C would exhibit slower movement. This is because Jupiter is farther from the Sun than Mars is. In the Solar System, a planet's year or sidereal period is dependent on its distance from the Sun. The farther a planet is from its star, the longer the distance it has to cover in its orbit. Additionally, its speed is also slower due to the reduced effect of the star's gravitational influence. In the case of Mars, it is situated closer to the Sun than Jupiter, resulting in a stronger gravitational pull. Consequently, Mars moves more quickly in its orbit than Jupiter does. To put this into context, Mars takes about 687 Earth days (approximately 1.88 Earth years) to orbit the Sun, while Jupiter requires 4,333 Earth days (approximately 11.86 Earth years) to complete its orbital period. As the planets approach their periastron or closest point to the star, their speed increases due to the conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy. On the other hand, as the planets recede to their apastron or farthest point from the Sun, their speed decreases. For both Mars and Jupiter, these changes in speed happen throughout their respective orbits. Therefore, observing the motion of these two planets through a telescope would reveal that Jupiter (case C) exhibits a slower movement compared to Mars (case A)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
