Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Options are: (a). fight yourself.; (b). fight other people.;","completion":"Option (b). Fight other people. Naive physics reasoning is a concept in artificial intelligence whereby a person or an agent approximates basic common-sense knowledge about the physical world to make judgments about cause and effect, predict outcomes, and solve simple problems. In the context of learning how to fight, applying naive physics reasoning can help us determine which method of practice would be more effective and beneficial. In order to provide a detailed analysis, let's look into the pros and cons of each option. Option (a) - Fight yourself: Pros: 1. Initial understanding: Practicing fighting techniques on your own could provide a basic understanding of core principles like stance, distance, and balance. Cons: 1. Limited skill development: Fighting yourself does not allow you to adapt or respond to different types of opponents and their fighting styles, limiting the enhancement of your skills. 2. Limited realism: When fighting against oneself, there is no genuine physical feedback or strategic adaptation. Consequently, this method would not prepare you for a real fight. 3. Reinforcement of bad habits: Without input or direction from a knowledgeable source, practicing on your own could reinforce poor techniques or bad habits, ultimately impeding your progress. Option (b) - Fight other people: Pros: 1. Skill development: By fighting different opponents, you can develop your techniques and broaden your understanding of different fighting styles as you learn to adapt and respond to various approaches. 2. Realistic situations: Engaging in physical combat with others provides a much more realistic context, simulating the conditions, pacing, and pressure of a real fight. 3. Feedback and improvement: Competing with others allows for more constructive feedback, which helps in identifying and correcting bad habits, as well as highlighting aspects of your technique that require improvement. Cons: 1. Potential for injury: Fighting other people can pose a risk of injury, particularly if safety precautions are not taken. In conclusion, option (b) fighting other people, is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. It provides a more realistic context and the opportunity to develop and hone your fighting techniques, adaptability, and strategy. Additionally, the potential to receive feedback and correct bad habits offers a higher likelihood of improvement and success. However, it is important to consider that engaging in physical combat should be done safely and under the guidance of experienced trainers or professionals. Proper safety equipment, regulated environments, and responsible training can help to mitigate the risk of injury and ensure the most effective learning experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To isolate y, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which is 26. 0/26 = (26*y - 2106)/26 0 = y - 2106/26 Step 4: Solve for y. Add the constant term to both sides to solve for y. 0 + 2106/26 = y y = 2106/26 Step 5: Simplify the fraction.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.

This is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúchecking labs,‚Äù ‚Äúdoing bloodwork,‚Äù or even ‚Äúchecking blood.‚Äù Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it‚Äôs part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or ‚Äúcomplete physical.‚Äù Last but not least, blood testing is usually ‚Äî although not always ‚Äî very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person‚Äôs electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it‚Äôs an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person‚Äôs health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it‚Äôs becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health.

Context: In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency ‚Äì and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress ‚Äì which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the ‚Äútop-of-mind‚Äù because everything that happens... Question: After this semester, what class will David Meyer teach?

I've had an acceptable experience - somewhere in the middle and nothing too spectacular when compared to other contenders in this category. Upon download and installation, the app appears to be relatively lightweight, rapidly installing on various devices without eating into the storage much, indicating efficient use of space. This is a standpoint worth applauding. However, the User Interface (UI) lacks the modernity found in competitor apps, exhibiting a dated design. The impression it commands at first interaction barely clings to average standards. Navigating through the app was a bit of a let-down. While ideally, the user experience should be fluid and intuitive, 'TwitterWrapper' demands time and a learning curve to understand its navigation system. Another sticking point was the occasional lag experienced during operation, which slightly hampered the overall fluidity. On the other hand, the app did manage to keep any significant bugs at bay which is commendable. The functionality of the app is basic yet solid. TwitterWrapper does a fair job of integrating Twitter services, as it promises. Tweets load properly, and the timeline is updated regularly without any significant glitches. The feature to integrate multiple Twitter accounts is commendable although the overall user experience can be improved upon. One pitfall I noticed was the lack of customization options. In the current era, users appreciate personalized experiences, and 'TwitterWrapper' has missed out on this chance. Also, there are a few safety and privacy concerns, like inadequate account protection measures, which may discourage potential users who prioritize security. The developers appear to perform frequent updates, a positive that indicates their commitment to the app's improvement. However, the update details are often vague and fail to pinpoint exactly which parts of the app have been improved, which could impact the user's ability to take full advantage of these updates. 'Customer support' remains an unexplored frontier. For instance, responses to queries and concerns are relatively slow. While they eventually do get back to you, the time lag can be somewhat frustrating when you're dealing with app issues. In summary, 'TwitterWrapper' has proven to be an app with stable operation and a simple navigational design, providing a satisfactory experience overall, but could impress users more with more additional features, a modern UI redesign, smoother navigation, better customer service, enhanced privacy protection, and thorough update explanations. However, a three-star rating does not mean that the app doesn't have the potential to become much better. The developers can take this as constructive feedback for future updates and hopefully, serve the user community better. I am optimistic about the app's future and look forward to more refined versions of 'TwitterWrapper'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He has been reassigned from combat duties in Korea by General Webster, the father of his fianc√©e, Eileen. Airman Joe Kelly, who is Ace's enlisted crew chief, is about to wed a Japanese woman, Katsumi, in spite of the disapproval of the United States military establishment, which will not recognize the inter-racial marriage. The Air Force, including Ace, is against the marriage. Ace and Joe have an argument during which Ace uses a racial slur to describe Katsumi. Ace eventually apologizes, then agrees to be Joe's best man at the wedding. Ace falls in love with a Japanese entertainer, Hana-ogi, who is a performer for a Takarazuka-like theater company, whom he meets through Katsumi. Eileen realizes that Ace's attentions are no longer focused on her and begins a friendship with a famous Kabuki performer, Nakamura.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person whose influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial?, using the article: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 ‚Äì late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht D√ºrer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral...., what would be the answer ?

Louisiana Mom Used Hand Sanitizer to Fatally Poison Son with Down Syndrome : People.com 09/16/2015 AT 03:50 PM EDT A Louisiana mother pleaded guilty to killing her 17-month-old son by injecting hand sanitizer into his feeding tube, the Plaquemines Parish District Attorney's Office tells PEOPLE. Lucas Ruiz was born with Down syndrome and an atrioventricular canal defect. He had surgery to repair the defect at a young age, but it required him to be fed through a feeding tube. He died in January 2014 after being poisoned with a lethal dose of hand sanitizer. His mother, Erika Wigstrom, was indicted on a first-degree murder charge just two months later, as well as an attempted murder charge for trying to kill Lucas in October 2012 by giving him an alcohol-based perfume. On Tuesday, she pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Wigstrom previously told detectives that she was only looking to put her son out of his misery, saying that she didn't want him to suffer anymore. Lucas' father, Cesar Ruiz, was also arrested in connection with his son's death. While in police custody, he reportedly confessed to giving his son rum through his feeding tube in October 2012, according to But prosecutors later said that he falsely admitted to the crime, and charged him with criminal mischief.

Hypothesis: - The Right Bank is a home to many retired French politicians. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise focuses on the concentration of couture houses and the presence of renowned designer shops on the Right Bank. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that the Right Bank is home to many retired French politicians. While it is possible, there might be some correlation between the high-end fashion industry and the residence of retired politicians (e.g., they may prefer to live in luxury or prestigious neighborhoods), the premise alone does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the hypothesis is true. The premise discusses the fashion industry and designer boutiques' presence on the Right Bank, while the hypothesis talks about the residential choices of retired French politicians. These two elements are not directly related, and more information about the factors influencing the residential choices of retired politicians would be necessary to draw a more robust conclusion about the hypothesis. To determine if the hypothesis is true, we would need additional evidence such as statistics on the number of retired politicians living in the area, surveys of their reasons for choosing the Right Bank, or studies showing a correlation between the presence of high-end fashion boutiques and the residential choices of retired politicians. In conclusion, based solely on the premise provided, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis.

The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created \\"Pong\\" as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game. - Atari, SA (ASA) is an international French holding company headquartered in Paris, France. It was originally called Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). Its subsidiaries include Atari London Studio, Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc.. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well.

They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview. - IMAGE (from Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), or Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the global response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind.

This 3-centimetre (1.18 in) diameter by 1-centimetre (0.39 in) thick pendant, made from rock-crystal, gold, garnet, and amethyst coloured-glass, has been worked in a lathe. The workmanship is not of a high standard. √Üthelberht of Kent was said to have built a church at Cratendune around 600 AD, about a mile from what is now Ely Cathedral. In 673 AD, √Üthelthryth considered restoring this church, thought to have been destroyed by Penda of Mercia, but instead made what is now Ely Cathedral the site of her monastery. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery, used at some point between 410‚Äì1065 AD, was uncovered around 1945 near Little Thetford (52.376N, 0.2375E), and was thought to be this lost village of Cratendune. A deserted Saxon settlement, 410‚Äì1065 AD, examined in 1999 in Ely, may also be a candidate for this lost site of worship.

The first written evidence that Ely Abbey had inherited the Little Thetford lands was in the 12th-century chronicle, Liber Eliensis. The will of √Ülfwaru (d. 1007), an Anglo-Saxon noblewoman, granted estates in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk to the Abbey, which included \\"... that land at Thetford and fisheries around those marshes\\". In 1110, Hervey le Breton, Bishop of Ely, granted the manor to William Brito, his Archdeacon and also his nephew. Chapel Hill in the village, near the river, commemorates the site of Harrimere Chapel, used since 1381. Some of the stone from this chapel, dismantled in 1571, was used in the building of St George's Church.

Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common. Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders. David is a biochemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is testing three strains of bacteria, case A, case B, and case C. In case A the bacteria does not respond to antibiotics. In case B the bacteria resists antibiotics. Finally, in case C, the bacteria does not develop any immunity to antibiotics and eventually perishes. In which case there would be some effect, case A or case B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"In case B, there would be some effect. In this scenario, the bacteria are able to resist antibiotics, which is an example of a beneficial mutation. This resistance allows the bacteria to survive and even thrive in an environment that would otherwise be harmful. The mutation that causes antibiotic resistance becomes more common over time, as the population of bacteria with this mutation increases. This is an example of natural selection, where the bacteria with advantageous traits become more dominant in their environment.

The basic principle behind this is the need for due impartiality of political coverage, as set out in the agreement accompanying the BBC Charter. This requires the BBC over time to \\"give due weight and prominence to all the main strands of argument and to all the main parties.\\" So, on polling day specifically, the BBC (like other broadcasters, though they are covered by the Ofcom code rather than a charter) doesn't report on any of the election campaigns from 00.30 until polls close at 22.00 BST on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk. However, online sites will not have to remove archived reports. Coverage will be restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations or the weather. Subjects which have been at issue or part of the campaign - or other controversial matters relating to the election - must not be covered on polling day, so the BBC's output cannot be seen as influencing the ballot while the polls are open. No opinion poll on any issue relating to politics or the election can be published until after the polls have closed. Whilst the polls are open, it is a criminal offence to publish anything about the way in which people have voted in that election.","completion":"The BBC has to follow rules during elections to be fair to everyone.

Theodosious was the last ruler over both Eastern and Western portions of a unified Roman Empire; the harbor has been buried and shrouded in mystery for over 800 years‚Ä¶until now. Istanbul, Turkey, is situated exactly between Europe and Asia. It has, since prehistoric times, bridged the gap between these continents, their cultures and its people. Engineers are working to connect East to West through a spectacular 1.4 kilometer railway tunnel, 60 meters below the surface, but they‚Äôve been stalled by the discovery of the Emperor‚Äôs Lost Harbor. The 'sacking of Constantinople' in 1204 by the Venetians and the Crusaders In Byzantium times up to 500,000 people lived in this melting pot metropolis, yet, very little is known about the visual history of this city. Its sudden disappearance in the 1200s has also remained a mystery. Istanbul is situated on an anatolian fault, which meets at the two continental plates ‚Äì the region frequently suffers from tremors ‚Äì often up to 10,000 a year. This would have been no different in Byzantine times, so was it an earthquake, or perhaps a tsunami that wiped out this incredible byzantine harbor? Canadian geologist Nick Eyles will introduce us to the people who are working to discover the truth. A team of 400 archeologists, engineers, laborers and scientists, led by Ufuk Kocabas, are racing to finish evacuations. As the 2012 transportation deadline draws closer, they face pressure from the transit authorities. Can the dig team fight off the pressures and complete their work before the window into the past closes? The site so far has unearthed hundreds of incredible artifacts dating from the seventh to the eleventh centuries, including 32 watercraft, four naval galleries, more than 170 gold coins, hundreds of clay, ivory, bronze, wooden and porcelain objects. They‚Äôve even recovered bones of camels, bears, ostriches, elephants, lions and human skulls. We will follow Kocabas and the scientists on their quest to save and preserve these treasures and solve this giant puzzle.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to where was the flag raised on iwo jima??","completion":"The iconic flag raising on Iwo Jima took place on Mount Suribachi, which is the highest point on the island of Iwo Jima, during the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II. Iwo Jima is a small volcanic island located in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 650 miles (1,046 kilometers) south of mainland Japan. The island comprises an area of approximately 8 square miles (20.6 square kilometers) and is part of the Volcano Islands chain of the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands. The Battle of Iwo Jima was fought between the United States and Japan from February 19, 1945, to March 26, 1945, as part of the US campaign to capture strategically important islands in the Pacific Theater of World War II. Iwo Jima was an essential target because it was situated midway between mainland Japan and US bombing bases in the Mariana Islands, allowing the US to use Iwo Jima as a refueling and rendezvous point for long-range bombers. The ultimate purpose of the campaign was to weaken Japan's military power in the Pacific and to pave the way for an eventual invasion of Japan. The flag raising on Mount Suribachi occurred on February 23, 1945, during the initial stages of the battle. US Marines fought their way to the top of the mountain, where they planted a smaller first American flag. This first flag raised by the marines was replaced, after a short while, by a larger flag to ensure that it could be seen clearly by American forces across the island. The moment of the replacement flag being raised was famously captured in the now-iconic photograph by Joe Rosenthal, titled \\"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima.\\" The photograph depicts six Marines raising the US flag on the summit of Mount Suribachi amidst the raging battle. These Marines were identified as Ira Hayes, Michael Strank, Rene Gagnon, Harlon Block, Franklin Sousley, and Harold Schultz. Tragically, three of them (Strank, Block, and Sousley) were killed in action later in the battle. This powerful image became an enduring symbol of American triumph and sacrifice in World War II, resonating with the nation in the face of massive wartime losses. The photograph went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Photography the same year it was published and served as the basis for the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, which was dedicated in 1954. Overall, the flag raising on Mount Suribachi highlights the bravery and tenacity of the US Marines during one of the bloodiest and most fiercely fought campaigns of World War II. The Battle of Iwo Jima remains a significant part of American military history and serves as a testament to the courage and sacrifice of those who fought and died to secure victory in the Pacific Theater."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

Please answer the following question: Information: - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - The black geese of the genus Branta are waterfowl belonging to the true geese and swans subfamily Anserinae. They occur in the northern coastal regions of the Palearctic and all over North America, migrating to more southernly coasts in winter, and as resident birds in the Hawaiian Islands. Alone in the Southern Hemisphere, a self-sustaining feral population derived from introduced Canada geese is also found in New Zealand. - Tierra del Fuegoliterally \\"Fire Land\\", formerly \\"Isla de Xativa\\" and also known as Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuegois an island near the southern tip of South America from which it is separated by the Strait of Magellan. The western portion of the island (and 61.43% of the island) is in Chile (Province of Tierra del Fuego and Ant√°rtica Chilena Province), while the eastern portion (and 38.57%) is in Argentina (Tierra del Fuego Province). It forms the major landmass in an extended group of islands or archipelago also known as Tierra del Fuego. - Patagonia is a sparsely populated region located at the southern end of South America, shared by Argentina and Chile. The region comprises the southern section of the Andes mountains as well as the deserts, steppes and grasslands east of this southern portion of the Andes. Patagonia has two coasts; a western one towards the Pacific Ocean and an eastern one towards the Atlantic Ocean. - East Falkland is the largest island of the Falklands in the South Atlantic having an area of or 54% of the total area of the Falklands. The island consists of two main land masses, the more southerly of which is known as Lafonia, joined by a narrow isthmus that was the scene of the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - West Falkland is the second largest of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. It is a hilly island, separated from East Falkland by the Falkland Sound. Its area is , 37% of the total area of the islands. Its coastline is long. - Beagle Channel is a strait in Tierra del Fuego Archipelago on the extreme southern tip of South America partly in Chile and partly in Argentina. The channel separates the larger main island of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego from various smaller islands including the islands of Picton, Lennox and Nueva; Navarino; Hoste; Londonderry; and Stewart. The channel's eastern area forms part of the border between Chile and Argentina and the western area is entirely within Chile. - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18¬∞ south and 20¬∞ south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern√°ndez, Salas y G√≥mez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl. - The Falkland Islands are an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Patagonian Shelf. The principal islands are about east of South America's southern Patagonian coast, at a latitude of about 52¬∞S. The archipelago, with an area of , comprises East Falkland, West Falkland and 776 smaller islands. As a British overseas territory, the Falklands have internal self-governance, and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The islands' capital is Stanley on East Falkland. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - The Anserinae are a subfamily in the waterfowl family Anatidae. It includes the swans and true geese. Under alternative systematical concepts (see e.g., Terres & NAS, 1991), it is split into two subfamilies, the Anserinae contain the geese and the ducks, while the Cygninae contain the swans. - The shelducks, genus Tadorna, are a group of large birds in the Tadorninae subfamily of the Anatidae, the biological family that includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as the geese and swans. - Grasslands are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses (Poaceae), however sedge (Cyperaceae) and rush (Juncaceae) families can also be found. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica. Grasslands are found in most ecoregions of the Earth. For example, there are five terrestrial ecoregion classifications (subdivisions) of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (ecosystem), which is one of eight terrestrial ecozones of the Earth's surface. - The Patagones or Patagonian giants are a mythical race of people, who first began to appear in early European accounts of the then little-known region and coastline of Patagonia. They were supposed to have exceeded at least double normal human height, some accounts giving heights of or more. Tales of these improbable people would take a hold over European concepts of the region for some 250 years, until they were substantially debunked at the end of the 18th century. - The Tadorninae is the shelduck-sheldgoose subfamily of the Anatidae, the biological family that includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as the geese and swans. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - Tierra del Fuego (; Spanish for \\"Land of Fire\\") is an archipelago off the southernmost tip of the South American mainland, across the Strait of Magellan. The archipelago consists of the main island, Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, with an area of , and a group of many islands, including Cape Horn and Diego Ram√≠rez Islands. Tierra del Fuego is divided between Chile and Argentina, with the latter controlling the eastern half of the main island and the former the western half plus the islands south of Beagle Channel. The southernmost extent of the archipelago is at about latitude 55 S. - Geese are waterfowl belonging to the tribe Anserini of the family Anatidae. This tribe comprises the genera \\"Anser\\" (the grey geese), \\"Branta\\" (the black geese) and \\"Chen\\" (the white geese). Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have \\"goose\\" as part of their names. More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller. - Duck is the common name for a large number of species in the waterfowl family Anatidae, which also includes swans and geese. The ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the family Anatidae; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species) but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water. - The Anatidae are the biological family of birds that includes ducks, geese, and swans. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on all the world's continents. These birds are adapted for swimming, floating on the water surface, and in some cases diving in at least shallow water. The family contains around 146 species in 40 genera. (The magpie goose is no longer considered to be part of the Anatidae, but is placed in its own family Anseranatidae.) - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - The coscoroba swan (\\"Coscoroba coscoroba\\") is a species of waterfowl endemic to southern South America. It is the smallest of the birds called \\"swans\\", but still a large species of waterfowl. It belongs to the subfamily Anserinae in the family of ducks, swans, and geese, Anatidae. It is placed in the monotypic genus \\"Coscoroba\\". The coscoroba swan is traditionally considered as an early branch from the common ancestor leading to true geese and swans, and recently genetic studies have associated a phylogenetic relationship between this species and Cape Barren goose (\\"Cereopsis novaehollandiae\\") as sister groups. - Swans are birds of the family Anatidae within the genus Cygnus. The swans' close relatives include the geese and ducks. Swans are grouped with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they form the tribe Cygnini. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct subfamily, Cygninae. There are six or seven species of swan in the genus \\"Cygnus\\"; in addition there is another species known as the coscoroba swan, although this species is no longer considered one of the true swans. Swans usually mate for life, though \\"divorce\\" does sometimes occur, particularly following nesting failure, and if a mate dies, the remaining swan will take up with another. The number of eggs in each clutch ranges from three to eight. - Waterfowl are certain wildfowl of the order Anseriformes, especially members of the family Anatidae, which includes ducks, geese, and swans. Some definitions of the term 'waterfowl' include the saltwater shorebirds or waders, gulls, pelicans, and herons, as well as seabirds such as the albatross, but 'fowl' especially refers to birds used by humans for game. They have historically been an important food source, and continue to be hunted as game, or raised as poultry for meat and eggs and are sometimes kept as pets. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad aut√≥noma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. - The kelp goose ( Spanish : Caranca or Cauqu√©n Marino ) , Chloephaga hybrida , is a member of the duck , goose and swan family Anatidae . It is in the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae . It can be found in the Southern part of South America ; in Patagonia , Tierra del Fuego , and the Falkland Islands .

I have a new situation: Two continents were known for the strange discrepancies in animal populations. Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles. But I can use this background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Pothinos (Leonard Mudie) kidnaps her and Apollodorus (Irving Pichel) and strands them in the desert. When Pothinos informs Julius Caesar that the queen has fled the country, Caesar is ready to sign an agreement with Ptolemy when Apollodorus appears, bearing a gift carpet for the Roman. When Apollodorus unrolls it, Cleopatra emerges much to Pothinos' surprise- he tries to deny who she is. However Caesar sees through the deception and Cleopatra soon beguiles Caesar with the prospect of the riches of not only Egypt, but also India. Later, when they are seemingly alone, she spots a sandal peeking out from underneath a curtain and thrusts a spear into the hidden Pothinos, foiling his assassination attempt. Caesar makes Cleopatra the sole ruler of Egypt, and begins an affair with her. Caesar eventually returns to Rome with Cleopatra to the cheers of the masses, but Roman unease is directed at Cleopatra. Cassius (Ian Maclaren), Casca (Edwin Maxwell), Brutus (Arthur Hohl) and other powerful Romans become disgruntled, rightly suspecting that he intends to abolish the Roman Republic and make himself emperor, with Cleopatra as his empress (after divorcing Calpurnia, played by Gertrude Michael). Ignoring the forebodings of Calpurnia, Cleopatra, and a soothsayer (Harry Beresford) who warns him about the Ides of March, Caesar goes to announce his intentions to the Senate. Before he can do so, he is assassinated. Cleopatra is heartbroken at the news. At first, she wants to go to him, but Apollodorus tells her that Caesar did not love her, only her power and wealth, and that Egypt needs her. They return home.

Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation. Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals, drafting legal pleadings, researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions. Often, barristers are also recognised as \\"legal scholars\\". - A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court. - Richard Pepper Arden , 1st Baron Alvanley PC KC ( 20 May 1744 -- 19 March 1804 ) was a British barrister and Whig politician , who served as the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas . He was a Member of Parliament from 1783 to 1801 . - Common law (also known as case law or precedent) is law developed by judges, courts, and similar tribunals, stated in decisions that nominally decide individual cases but that in addition have precedential effect on future cases. Common law is a third branch of law, in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as \\"stare decisis\\"). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \\"matter of first impression\\"), judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision). Resolution of the issue in one case becomes precedent that binds future courts. \\"Stare decisis\\", the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems. - A tribunal, generally, is any person or institution with authority to judge, adjudicate on, or determine claims or disputeswhether or not it is called a tribunal in its title. For example, an advocate who appears before a court with a single judge could describe that judge as 'their tribunal'. Many governmental bodies that are titled 'tribunals' are so described to emphasize that they are not courts of normal jurisdiction. For example, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is a body specially constituted under international law; in Great Britain, employment tribunals are bodies set up to hear specific employment disputes. Private judicial bodies are also often styled 'tribunals'. The word \\"tribunal\\" is not conclusive of a body's function. For example, in Great Britain, the Employment Appeal Tribunal is a superior court of record. What entity does 'richard arden' has the relation 'occupation' with?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? What are innovative mechanical component designs? What is the Innovation design?","completion":"While these questions may seem related at first glance, they do not have the same meaning. Each question is focused on different aspects of design and innovation. Let's examine the two questions individually to understand the distinction. Question 1: \\"What are innovative mechanical component designs?\\" This question is specifically asking about innovative designs in the field of mechanical components. Mechanical components are individual parts or elements that comprise machines, systems, or devices. These components can include gears, bearings, linkages, springs, and other parts that facilitate motion, transfer power, or control a mechanism. Innovative mechanical component designs refer to new, groundbreaking, or creative methods of designing these components. This can involve improving the functionality or efficiency of the components as well as optimizing their performance, durability, and reliability. The question targets advancements and breakthroughs in the design of individual mechanical components rather than entire systems or the broader concept of innovation. Some examples of innovative mechanical component designs are: 1. Shape-memory alloys: These alloys can return to their original shape after being deformed, allowing for smaller, more-efficient actuators and self-healing structures. 2. Metamaterials: Engineered materials with unique structures and properties that enable a wide range of applications, including lightweight and strong components or components with novel mechanical properties. 3. Additive manufacturing (3D printing): This technology allows designers to produce complex, organic shapes that would otherwise be impossible to manufacture through traditional processes. Question 2: \\"What is the Innovation design?\\" Innovation design is a broader concept that includes various aspects of the design process, with an emphasis on the development of novel and creative solutions or products. It is not restricted to any specific field or discipline and can span across different industries. Innovation design involves the process of identifying problems, generating new ideas, and creating valuable solutions. This can include the improvement of existing products, the development of new products, the enhancement of services, or even the reconfiguration of organizational structures and processes to benefit users and customers. In general, innovation design focuses on three main areas: 1. Design thinking: A problem-solving approach that encourages empathy, creativity, and experimentation to better understand and address user needs. 2. Open innovation: The idea of utilizing external knowledge, resources, and collaborations to drive innovation within an organization or project. 3. Disruptive innovation: A process that displaces established technologies, products, or services by introducing new, more innovative alternatives that offer significant advantages. To summarize, the first question is specifically focused on the design of innovative mechanical components, while the second question addresses the broader concept of innovation design across various industries and disciplines. While both questions are related to innovation, they target different aspects and processes within their respective fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: Vantage Energy operates the natural gas drilling site on the grounds of Lake Arlington Baptist Church. (Photo: WFAA) ARLINGTON ‚Äî Two months ago, 100 homes in Arlington had to be evacuated as fracking fluid spilled out of a drilling site onto the city streets. Now we know officially what happened, why it happened, and why Arlington officials are blaming the drilling company for \\"unacceptable behavior.\\" A series of video recordings obtained by News 8 shows the scene behind the walls of a fracking site 600 feet from a cluster of homes in the state's seventh largest city. In the incident, 42,800 gallons of fracking fluid ‚Äî boiling up from thousands of feet underground ‚Äî spewed into the streets and into Arlington storm sewers and streams. WFAA obtained this video that shows a leak of fracking fluid from an Arlington drilling site (Photo: WFAA) Four attempts and 24 hours later, experts were finally able to plug the natural gas well. Nearby residents and Arlington officials feared the worst. Now, two months later, fire officials have concluded their investigation. \\"Clearly there was a release of unpermitted materials into the stormwater system,\\" said Arlington Fire Chief Don Crowson as he addressed Arlington City Council members on Tuesday. The good news, according to Crowson: Despite numerous toxic substances being released into the environment, tests show it was not in amounts that did significant damage to the environment. The bad news? He said the drilling company mishandled the spill. \\"For my concerns, the main issue I articulated to you a few months ago was the delayed notification of 911,\\" Crowson said. \\"It's not acceptable.\\" According to the report, Vantage Energy first contacted 911 nearly two hours after fracking water first started to spill. What's more, the call to 911 came not from the site, but from corporate headquarters in Pennsylvania. \\"This is unacceptable behavior,\\" said City Council member Robert Rivera. \\"The citizens of Arlington do not appreciate the lack of ability to control the site.\\" LABC gas well leak (Photo: WFAA) The official causeof the spill at a site adjacent to Lake Arlington Baptist Church is listed as equipment failure.

(Published Tuesday, June 16, 2015) An Arlington gas well site that leaked thousands of gallons of fracking fluid in April could soon resume drilling. All operations at Vantage Energy's Lake Arlington Baptist Church site along Little Road have been suspended since that leak occurred. The company said a well head component malfunctioned, causing a back flow of fracking fluid to spill out. No natural gas leaked from the well, but the incident forced dozens of families in the area to evacuate their homes. On Tuesday, Arlington Fire Chief Don Crowson gave the City Council an update on the cleanup efforts. 92-Year-Old Woman Arrested in Denton Fracking Protest A 92-year-old mother and son were the latest arrests in Denton‚Äôs fracking protests Tuesday; only that mother also happens to be a great grandmother.

They've owned the responsibility for it.\\" Through the course of their investigation, fire officials determined more than 42,000 gallons of fracking fluid escaped into the city's storm water system. They don't believe the city's water supply or the public are in any danger. \\"Arlington Environmental, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the EPA tested the water and soil samples in several locations and found pollutant material below levels that will require further remediation,\\" said Assistant Fire Chief Jim Self. Crowson said Vantage has identified the faulty component that caused the well head to malfunction and has taken steps to fix the problem on that well and others. The company has also paid the city more than 82,000 to reimburse taxpayers for the response to the leak. That doesn't include additional fines Vantage had to pay for three citations the city issued following the incident. \\"Our relationship with Vantage has been very good historically,\\" said Crowson. Crowson did not mince words, though, when he discussed Vantage's decision to wait nearly two hours before reporting the leak to 911. He called the company's actions \\"unacceptable\\" and said he's met with Vantage and other energy companies to make sure they understand that. \\"Call the fire department immediately,\\" said Crowson. \\"That's been carefully and directly communicated.\\" In an email to NBC 5, a spokesperson for Vantage said, \\"We've worked collaboratively with the fire department on revised notification procedures.\\" Crowson said the site has to pass one last inspection before drilling can resume. When that happens, he said the public will be notified. ||||| The Fire Department has taken a gas well operator to task and imposed rules to make sure a leak like the one that occurred in southwest Arlington on April 11 doesn‚Äôt happen again, top fire officials told the City Council at an afternoon work session Tuesday. A pipe sprung a softball-size hole at the Vantage Energy well site at 3016 Little Road, allowing nearly 43,000 gallons of fracking water and chemicals to gush into the city storm-water system and sparking fears that natural gas would follow, Assistant Fire Chief Jim Self said. More than 100 families living within 1/8 mile were evacuated as a precaution. ‚ÄúSome were displaced as long as 21 hours,‚Äù Self said. Never miss a local story.

Self and Fire Chief Don Crowson assured the council that they have taken steps to clarify the city‚Äôs expectations in such emergencies. Step 1: Call 911 before doing anything else. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not kidding around about the 911 issue,‚Äù Crowson said during a break. ‚ÄúIt was a very serious situation. It could have ended in a bad outcome. Two hours‚Äô advance notice could have helped alot. Luckily, we were prepared and we worked well with [Vantage], and we were able to resolve the issue.‚Äù The pipe began leaking about 1 p.m. It was carrying water and solvents that had been used, under high pressure, to fracture shale and release its natural gas. At any moment, the frack-water leak could have become a gas leak. Stopping the leak took almost 24 hours. City officials praised Vantage officials for their cooperation. City Manager Trey Yelverton said Vantage hasn‚Äôt been the only focus. The city‚Äôs expectations have been communicated to all drilling operators in Arlington. In other business, the council told parks officials to work both a senior center and a ‚Äúmultigenerational‚Äù activities center into the ongoing update of the parks master plan. Parks Director Lemuel Randolph estimated the senior center‚Äôs cost at 25 million and the all-ages facility at 40 million. He said the master plan was virtually finished in November when a new senior center became a priority. About 25 older residents in red T-shirts attended the afternoon session to lend silent support for a stand-alone senior center. Then at the evening council meeting, they weren‚Äôt so silent. Several walked to the lectern at the end of the meeting to lobby. Elva Roy, head of Age-Friendly Arlington Action Brigade, asked that the city dedicate the last quarter-cent available in the city sales tax to raising money for a senior center, and put the issue on the November election ballot. Seniors now use portions of two aging activities center, called Eunice and New York. The seniors want something like the Summit, the 23 million 50-and-over senior center in Grand Prairie that opened in 2010, Roy said. ‚ÄúWhen you walk into the Summit, it‚Äôs just so tranquil,‚Äù she said. ||||| Summary:","completion":"In Arlington, Texas, a drilling site operated by Vantage Energy leaked 42,800 gallons of fracking fluid into the streets and storm sewers before it was finally contained after 24 hours.

We have an equation that looks like this: 77 * c + 94122 - 97510 = 0. 2. First, we want to deal with the numbers that don't have the letter \\"c\\" with them. We have 94122 and -97510, so we will subtract 97510 from 94122. It looks like this: 94122 - 97510 = -3388. 3. Now, our equation looks like this: 77 * c - 3388 = 0. 4. To find the value of \\"c\\", we want to get rid of the -3388. So, we will do the opposite of subtraction, which is addition. We will add 3388 to both sides of the equation. It looks like this: 77 * c - 3388 + 3388 = 0 + 3388. 5. After adding, we get: 77 * c = 3388. 6. Now, we want to find out the value of \\"c\\". To do this, we have to divide 3388 by 77, because the equation is 77 times \\"c\\" equals to 3388. It looks like this: c = 3388 / 77. 7. After dividing, we find that c equals 44.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: Sara Blakely. Credit: Ben Baker / Redux In the five days since my Forbes cover story on Spanx creator Sara Blakely was published, readers have been writing, tweeting, and commenting with questions about the youngest self-made woman on our latest World‚Äôs Billionaires list and her 1 billion invention. While a handful of these emails have been of the ‚ÄúWill Sara marry me?‚Äù variety (for the record: no), the vast majority have expressed amazement that Blakely, 41, grew her undergarment empire without any outside investment, debt, or even a cent spent on advertising. When I spent some time with Blakely in Atlanta a few months back, she and company CEO Laurie Ann Goldman told me how Spanx grew from a one-product wonder to a household name without shelling out on ads: 1. Word of mouth worked better. When Blakely was still selling Spanx out of a Decatur, Ga. apartment in white Office Depot envelopes, advertising wasn‚Äôt a priority, namely because there was no way she could afford it. She started Spanx with 5,000 in savings at 27 years old. Word of mouth wasn‚Äôt so much a strategy as a necessity. But today, even with the brand‚Äôs incredible success, Goldman insists the company still won‚Äôt advertise, even though they could now afford every billboard in Times Square. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been self-funded from the beginning,‚Äù Goldman said. ‚ÄúWe had to spend money only on things that make money and advertising was esoteric. You couldn‚Äôt really measure the return you were going to get so we didn‚Äôt do it. The power of women discovering the brand from other women was actually a better strategy. The aunt telling her niece; one woman to a college friend. There‚Äôs something about saying, ‚Äòlook, feel my back, no lines‚Äô that‚Äôs powerful. Look at how big social media has become now. People trust advice.‚Äù In the New York flagship Bloomingdale‚Äôs on 59th Street, Spanx has an ‚Äúin-store shop‚Äù, as they call it: a store within a store, all very on-message with the company‚Äôs trademark bright pinks and reds and candy jars and lava lamps. The brand‚Äôs reliance on word of mouth and woman-to-woman advice is evident in just a few minutes browsing the racks. A twentysomething student stops in because she admired a friend‚Äôs smooth derriere at yoga class in the brand‚Äôs 118 ‚ÄòPower Pants‚Äô. An older lady with a Margaret Thatcher bouffant has been sent by her daughter to try the footless pantyhouse, Spanx‚Äôs first ever product, still a hit almost 12 years on. 2. Their packaging did the talking. In Spanx‚Äôs early days ‚Äî and today, to a lesser extent ‚Äî the brand‚Äôs cherry-red, cartoon-adorned packaging was crucial in setting the brand apart from its competitors in the beige hinterland of the lingerie floor, where bored-looking women gaze out from a neutral-colored pantyhose packet, maybe stroking a leg. Blakely knew early on that, without advertising, she needed to attract attention on the racks themselves. Blakely cut out eyes, noses and ears from magazines, figuring out how she‚Äôd like her cartoon alter ego to look. Today, blonde, pony-tailed Sunny is still the brand‚Äôs ‚Äòmascot‚Äô, although she‚Äôd had a few makeovers since 2000. Blakely also abhorred the way she felt lingerie companies talked down to women in their marketing. ‚ÄúI literally was writing things on the packaging how I‚Äôd tell a girlfriend,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt saying, ‚Äòit‚Äôs the sheerest of the sheerest most sheer elegance.‚Äô Just, ‚Äòit makes your butt look better.‚Äô‚Äù Spanx products are all given cutesy, wink-wink names like Bra-llelujah and Tight-End Tights. And Blakely was sure not to waste any of the packaging‚Äôs excess material. Each cardboard insert is a comic strip, ‚Äúlike in Bazooka bubblegum‚Äù, Blakely says ‚Äî partly an outlet for her stand-up comedy, one of many pre-Spanx careers, and partly to encourage women to collect ‚Äòem all. One insert for bridal shapewear shows the bride-to-be trying to contain her rear end in a wedding dress. Says the caption: ‚ÄúWhen you think everyone‚Äôs looking at your train but they‚Äôre really looking at your caboose.‚Äù Write a title for it.","completion":"How Sara Blakely Built a Billion-Dollar Business without Advertising"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Exceptionalism, Faith and Freedom: Palin's America In her Facebook reflections on the events in Arizona, Sarah Palin observes that our government was not designed for ‚Äúperfect men and women.‚Äù It is because we are not angels, she says , that we require a system of government that acknowledges ‚Äúthe inevitable conflicts‚Äù produced by our ‚Äúimperfect passions‚Äù and yet provides mechanisms ‚Äî free speech, vigorous debate ‚Äî that allow us to settle those conflicts without resorting to ‚Äúdueling pistols.‚Äù That, she declares, is the system the Founders designed, and it is part of ‚Äúwhy America is exceptional,‚Äù an assertion she makes twice. This mixture of Calvinist pessimism and unabashed patriotism is writ large in Palin‚Äôs recent book, ‚ÄúAmerica by Heart: Reflections on Family, Faith, and Flag.‚Äù The book opens with a celebration of Frank Capra‚Äôs Jefferson Smith, the hero of ‚ÄúMr. Smith Goes to Washington‚Äù (1939). Smith (played by Jimmy Stewart) is an accidental senator who finds his idealism mocked and blocked by corrupt politicians, greedy industrialists and propagandistic newspapers. The climax of the movie is Smith‚Äôs filibuster, in the course of which he cites the Declaration of Independence, written by his namesake, Thomas Jefferson. At this moment Smith embodies Capra‚Äôs typical hero ‚Äî a man who draws his strength from an internal reservoir of virtue, a man who refuses to deed his integrity to some impersonal structure of government or business, a man who is, above all, free. It is such men who in Capra‚Äôs films at once represent and inspire grass-roots movements in which decent, average people come together not at the behest of a charismatic leader or a corporation, but at the behest of an idea. For Smith that idea is to love thy neighbor, and it has led him to propose the establishment of camps for homeless boys to be paid for by private contributions and not by the state. In ‚ÄúMeet John Doe,‚Äù the reluctant hero (played by Gary Cooper) is a free-spirit hobo whose words (written for him by Barbara Stanwyck) inspire the formation of John Doe clubs dedicated to justice and the spreading of good-neighbor citizenship. In ‚ÄúMr. Deeds Goes to Town,‚Äù the title hero (again played by Gary Cooper ) resolves to give away an inherited fortune by offering 10-acre farms to down-and-out families who agree to work them. In ‚ÄúState of the Union,‚Äù an industrialist-turned-politician (played by Spencer Tracy) withdraws from a presidential contest because he will not be owned by or beholden to a party; he wants to speak in his own voice. In each of these films the forces of statism, corporatism and mercantilism are routed by the spontaneous uprising of ordinary men who defeat the sophisticated machinations of their opponents by declaring, living and fighting for a simple basic creed of individualism, self-help, independence and freedom. Does that sound familiar? It should. It describes what we have come to know as the Tea Party, which famously has no leaders, no organization, no official platform, no funds from the public trough. Although she only mentions the Tea Party briefly in her book, Palin is busily elaborating its principles, first in the lengthy discussion of Capra‚Äôs Jefferson Smith and then, at the end of the same chapter, in an equally lengthy discussion of Martin Luther King. These two men (one fictional, one real) are brought together when Palin says that King‚Äôs dream of an America that lived out ‚Äúthe true meaning of its creed‚Äù would be, if it were realized, ‚Äúthe fulfillment of America‚Äôs exceptional destiny.‚Äù A belief in that destiny and that exceptionalism is, she concludes, ‚Äúa belief Senator Jefferson Smith would have agreed with.‚Äù (In the spirit of full disclosure, I myself became a believer in American exceptionalism the first time I visited Europe, in 1966.) Exceptionalism can mean either that America is different in some important respect or that, in its difference, America is superior. Palin clearly means the latter: ‚ÄúWhen we say America is exceptional we‚Äôre saying we are the lucky heirs to a unique set of beliefs and national qualities‚Äù and that we are ‚Äúa model to the world.‚Äù She finds support for her assertion n in the writings of de Tocqueville (‚ÄúThe position of the Americans [is] quite exceptional‚Äù), Crevecoeur (‚ÄúWhat then is the American, this new man?‚Äù), John Winthrop (‚ÄúWe shall be as a city upon a hill; the eyes of all people are upon us‚Äù), Frederick Jackson Turner (the frontier ‚Äúproduced a new product that is American‚Äù); and she might also have cited Emerson, Woodrow Wilson and the many Puritans who proclaimed that they were building a ‚ÄúNew Jerusalem‚Äù on the American shores. It is easy to see from these references that the claim of exceptionalism has a source in religion, specifically in the tradition of translatio imperii, the idea that empire and faith are traveling westward. In 1633 the English poet George Herbert announced that ‚Äúreligion stands on tip-toe in our land, / Ready to pass to the American strand,‚Äù where it would ‚Äúdraw more near‚Äù to the last judgment and the second coming of Christ. Palin is thus on firm ground when she links ‚Äúthe understanding that we are an exceptional nation‚Äù with the observation, made by de Tocqueville, that in America ‚Äúthe spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom [are] intimately united.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Founders,‚Äù she declares, ‚Äúdeliberately and self-consciously constructed a government based on the belief that religion was at the root of the personal and public virtues necessary to sustain freedom.‚Äù In her view, we are free and equal because as children of God we have an inherent dignity that is inviolate: ‚ÄúWe are free as a consequence of being made in the image of God.‚Äù In statements like this, Palin brings together her argument for a certain form of politics (‚Äúto govern ourselves locally without waiting for any central authority to show us the way‚Äù), her claim of American exceptionalism (‚Äúwe have managed to be, for the most part, the moral and upright people that our Founders hoped we would be‚Äù), her grounding of democracy in religion (the equality of men and women follows from their status as God‚Äôs children) and her admiration for Jefferson Smith, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King and Frank Capra. There is then a unity to the book, but it is not one Palin proclaims or works out discursively. Rather, the unity is conveyed by the quotations that carry the argument, long (sometimes two-page) quotations from an impressive variety of authors, quotations that are strong in isolation and even stronger when they are laid next to one another. The book is really an anthology. The author does not present herself as controlling or magisterial; she gives her authorities space and then she gets out of the way. Her performance mimes the book‚Äôs lesson: rather than acting as a central authority, she lets individual voices speak for themselves. Humility is not something Palin is usually credited with, but here she enacts it by yielding the stage as others proclaims the truths she wants us to carry away. Not, however, always. Two other strains in the book seem out of place. One is a series of family reminiscences that might more properly be found on Palin‚Äôs reality show. The other is an intermittent attack on the Obama administration that might more properly be found in a campaign tract. There is, to be sure, a rationale for this attack: in Palin‚Äôs view, Obama gets exceptionalism wrong. ‚ÄúWe have a president,‚Äù she complains, who believes ‚Äúthat America is not the greatest earthly force for good the world has known.‚Äù And the references to her family do connect up with the themes of faith and virtue she stresses. But the book would have stronger had she resisted the temptations of sentimentality and partisanship. Still, as an account of one woman‚Äôs love for her country, it is strong enough, and to read it is to understand the appeal she has for so many, an appeal that may have been clouded, but has not been eclipsed, by what happened in Arizona. An then there‚Äôs a bonus, the appearance and explication of the word ‚Äúrefudiation.‚Äù It is very well done, and with the appropriate measure of self-mockery, but I will say no more and leave you to experience its pleasures for yourself.

Key points include: 1. Palin's belief that America's exceptionalism stems from a unique set of beliefs and national qualities, making it a model to the world. 2. Her perspective on American exceptionalism is connected to a religious tradition, with the founding fathers deliberately constructing a government that recognizes the role of religion in sustaining freedom and upholding the dignity of individuals made in the image of God. 3. The article analyzes Palin's book, \\"America by Heart: Reflections on Family, Faith, and Flag,\\" noting that the author cedes the floor to a variety of voices and authoritative figures in quotations supporting her argument, showcasing a sense of humility. 4.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). I am facing a new situation today: Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which runner had an increased blood flow to the muscles? The answer is:","completion":"Tom had an increased blood flow to the muscles. This is because he properly warmed up before running, which gradually increased the intensity of his physical activity. Warming up helps increase blood flow to the muscles and raises the heart rate, ultimately preparing the muscles and tendons for the activity at hand.

Expand this summary.","completion":"In Ohio, an appeals court has upheld an unusual sentence for a man named Asim Taylor, who owes approximately 100,000 in child support. The court reaffirmed that the man from Elyria cannot have any more children until he pays his outstanding child support. Taylor, currently in his mid-30s, has fathered four children and could face jail time if he impregnates someone during his five-year probation period. Taylor's lawyer said he plans to appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, asserting that his client has a constitutional right to procreate. The appeals court did not specifically address the legal merits of the original court order from 2013. The court stated that it lacked the necessary information, specifically a pre-sentencing report, to consider the issue thoroughly. However, one of the three judges involved in the appeal process wrote a separate opinion in which they supported the reasoning behind the original court order. The judge explained that the defendant's long-term refusal to support multiple children by multiple women, despite his ability to work and contribute to their care, makes the anti-procreation condition reasonably related to future criminality. This case raises complex legal and constitutional questions related to the government's ability to restrict an individual's right to procreate. The anti-procreation order, issued as part of Taylor's probation, seems to be a creative attempt by the courts to incentivize him to pay the child support he owes to his children‚Äôs custodial parents. If the original court order and its subsequent appeals are any indication, this case may stir debate over the boundaries of constitutional rights and the role of the state in personal matters such as family planning and financial responsibility. The Asim Taylor case is not the only one of its kind in the United States. In 2012, a Wisconsin judge ordered a man, who had nine children with six different women and owed about 100,000 in child support, to stop having children until he could demonstrate an ability to support them. Another case involved a man dubbed the government's most wanted deadbeat parent, who faced over 1 million in unpaid child support before his eventual arrest. These cases indicate a growing trend of the legal system attempting to address the issue of parents who do not pay their mandated child support. As the Taylor case continues to work its way through the appeals process, it is likely that the debate over constitutional rights and personal responsibilities will continue to evolve. Regardless of the outcome, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of financial responsibility in supporting one's children and the potential consequences that may stem from failing to fulfill this obligation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single‚Äî\\"Radio Free Europe\\"‚Äîin 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history.

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi? Answer the above question based on the context below: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango. Which fruit have a lower sugar content candied plums or fresh oranges? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glac√© fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] A:","completion":"Candied plums have a higher sugar content than fresh oranges. Candied fruits undergo a preservation process where they are soaked in sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit while also saturating it with sugar. This not only extends the life of the fruit but also significantly increases its sugar content. Fresh oranges, on the other hand, do not undergo this preservation process and retain their natural sugar content. According to the USDA FoodData Central, 100 grams of fresh oranges contain approximately 9.14 grams of sugar, while 100 grams of candied plums can have around 80 grams or more of sugar, although the exact amount may vary depending on the specific recipe or method used for candying. The preservation process of candying allows Dan to keep the plums, pears, ginger, and quince for a longer time without spoilage, as the high sugar concentration creates unfavorable osmotic pressure for microorganisms, inhibiting their growth. However, this comes at the cost of a significantly higher sugar content in these candied fruits compared to their fresh counterparts, such as the apples, oranges, and mangoes that Dan has chosen to eat fresh. In conclusion, candied plums have a much higher sugar content than fresh oranges due to the preservation process they undergo. Although this process helps extend the life and maintain the quality of the candied fruits, it substantially increases their sugar content when compared to fresh fruits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As it sounds, the polar zone is near earths poles. The polar zone has very long and cold winters. Brrr!!!! Near the equator is the tropical zone. The tropical zone is known for being hot and wet. Between these two zones is the temperate zone. Temperatures there tend to be mild. Its not too hot and not too cold. You might expect places near the equator to be hot and wet. Thats not always the case. Sometimes there are other factors at work. These factors can affect the local climate type or a region. Oceans and mountain ranges can have a major impact. They can greatly influence the climate of an area. Many factors influence an areas climate. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Which climate zone is situated between the other two geographically?\\" is \\"Temperate\\"?","completion":"Yes, that is correct. The temperate climate zone is situated between the other two geographically. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's describe the three climate zones and their characteristics. 1. Polar Zone: The polar zones are located near the Earth's poles, specifically, the areas inside the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. These zones have extremely cold temperatures throughout the year and experience long, harsh winters. Consequently, they have unique ecosystems adapted to their extreme conditions, such as polar bears in the Arctic or penguins in the Antarctic. The polar zones receive less sunlight due to the Earth's tilt, which results in the sun's rays striking the poles at low angles, distributing the energy over a larger surface area. 2. Tropical Zone: The tropical zone lies near the Equator and is characterized by high temperatures and high levels of precipitation. This climate zone supports some of the most biodiverse ecosystems, such as rainforests. The Earth's tilt also plays a role in the climate of tropical zones; they receive more direct sunlight, leading to higher temperatures and evaporation rates. Tropical climates are further categorized into tropical rainforest, tropical monsoon, and tropical wet and dry or savanna climates. 3. Temperate Zone: The temperate climate zone is situated between the polar and tropical zones and is considered to have a more moderate climate. The temperatures in these regions aren't as extreme as those found in polar or tropical zones. These climates also experience distinct seasonality, with noticeable differences in temperature and precipitation between seasons. The temperate zone can be further broken down into various categories such as oceanic, Mediterranean, humid subtropical, humid continental, and subarctic climates, each with their own unique characteristics. Indeed, the correct answer to the question \\"Which climate zone is situated between the other two geographically?\\" is the \\"Temperate\\" climate zone. The temperate climate's specific location on Earth varies by latitude, but it generally exists between the Tropic of Cancer (23.5 degrees North latitude) and the Arctic Circle (66.5 degrees North latitude) in the Northern Hemisphere, and between the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5 degrees South latitude) and the Antarctic Circle (66.5 degrees South latitude) in the Southern Hemisphere. These regions exhibit mild and moderate climates, making them suitable for hosting diverse ecosystems and human populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Born in Glen Dale, West Virginia, Brett was the youngest of four sons of a sports-minded family which included Ken, the second oldest, a major league pitcher who pitched in the 1967 World Series at age 19. Brothers John (eldest) and Bobby had brief careers in the minor leagues. Although his three older brothers were born in Brooklyn, George was born in the northern panhandle of West Virginia. Jack and Ethel Brett then moved the family to the Midwest and three years later to El Segundo, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, just south of Los Angeles International Airport. On July 24, 1983, the Royals played the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. In the top of the ninth inning with two out, Brett hit a go-ahead two-run homer off of Goose Gossage to put the Royals up 5-4. Upon Brett crossing the plate, Yankees manager Billy Martin cited to the umpires a rule that stated that any foreign substance on a bat could extend no further than 18 inches from the knob. The umpires measured the amount of pine tar, a legal substance used by hitters to improve their grip, on Brett's bat; the pine tar extended about 24 inches. The home plate umpire, Tim McClelland, signaled Brett out, ending the game as a Yankees win. In a now famous image, an enraged Brett charged out of the dugout sprinting directly toward McClelland and had to be physically restrained by two umpires and a Royals coach. The Royals protested the game, and American League president Lee MacPhail upheld the protest, reasoning that the bat should have been excluded from future use but the home run should not have been nullified. Amid much controversy, the game was resumed on August 18 from the point of Brett's home run and ended with a Royals win. In 1985, Brett had another brilliant season in which he helped propel the Royals to their second American League Championship. He batted .335 with 30 home runs and 112 RBI, finishing in the top 10 of the league in 10 different offensive categories. Defensively, he won his only Gold Glove, which broke Buddy Bell's six-year run of the award. In the final week of the regular season, he went 9-for-20 at the plate with 7 runs, 5 homers, and 9 RBI in six crucial games, five of them victories, as the Royals closed the gap and won the division title at the end. He was MVP of the 1985 playoffs against the Toronto Blue Jays, with an incredible Game 3. With KC down in the series two games to none, Brett went 4-for-4, homering in his first two at bats against Doyle Alexander, and doubled to the same spot in right field in his third at bat, leading the Royals' comeback. Brett then batted .370 in the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals including a four-hit performance in Game 7. The Royals again rallied from a 3-1 deficit to become World Series Champions for the first time in Royals history. What were the consequences?","completion":"The consequences of the controversy surrounding George Brett's home run during the July 24, 1983 game between the Kansas City Royals and the New York Yankees involved several aspects: the protest filed, the decision to uphold the protest, and the subsequent resumption of the game. To provide context, Yankees manager Billy Martin cited a rule about foreign substances on a bat, leading the umpires to measure the pine tar on Brett's bat. They found that the pine tar extended about 24 inches, 6 inches beyond the allowed limit. Consequently, home plate umpire Tim McClelland signaled for Brett's out, and the game seemingly ended as a Yankees win. This led to a now-iconic image of an enraged Brett charging towards the umpire, only to be restrained by two umpires and a Royals coach. The immediate consequence was the Royals filing a protest against the ruling and the outcome of the game. American League president Lee MacPhail reviewed the situation and upheld the protest, stating that while Brett's bat should have been excluded from future use, the home run should not have been nullified. This led to another consequence‚Äîa resumption of the game on August 18, 1983, from the point of Brett's controversial home run. This unusual continuation of a game sparked further controversy but ultimately concluded with a Royals win. In a broader context, the consequences of this incident did not hinder George Brett's performance, as he went on to have a brilliant 1985 season. He played a pivotal role in getting the Royals to their second American League Championship and helped them win the division title. He was named MVP of the 1985 playoffs against the Toronto Blue Jays and maintained a strong performance in the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. The Royals ultimately won the World Series that year for the first time in their history, overcoming a 3-1 deficit against the Cardinals. In summary, the consequences of the pine tar incident involved a unique protest and resumption of a game, as well as ongoing controversy, but did not impact George Brett's career negatively. Instead, he continued to excel, contributing significantly to the Royals' World Series victory in 1985."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Plot title: Rashomon Movie plot: The film opens on a woodcutter (√¶¬ú¬®√¶¬®¬µ√£¬Ç¬ä; Kikori, played by Takashi Shimura) and a priest (√¶¬ó¬Ö√¶¬≥¬ï√•¬∏¬´; Tabi H√Ö¬çshi, Minoru Chiaki) sitting beneath the Raj√Ö¬çmon city gate to stay dry in a downpour. A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest; upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened. Both men were then summoned to testify in court, where they met the captured bandit Taj√Ö¬çmaru (√•¬§¬ö√®¬•¬Ñ√§¬∏¬∏), who claimed responsibility for killing the samurai and raping his wife. The bandit's story[edit] Taj√Ö¬çmaru (Toshiro Mifune), a notorious brigand, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but was eventually \\"seduced\\" by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. Taj√Ö¬çmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In Taj√Ö¬çmaru's recollection they fought skillfully and fiercely, but in the end Taj√Ö¬çmaru was the victor and the woman ran away. At the end of the story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife: he says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that it was foolish of him to leave behind such a valuable object. The wife's story[edit] The samurai's wife (Machiko Ky√Ö¬ç) tells a different story to the court. She says that Taj√Ö¬çmaru left after raping her. She begged her husband to forgive her, but he simply looked at her coldly. She then freed him and begged him to kill her... My question: What shakes the priest's faith in humanity? A:","completion":"The priest's faith in humanity is shaken due to the various conflicting accounts of the same event narrated by each of the characters involved in the story. This inconsistency of testimonies reveals the ambiguous and self-serving nature of humans, challenging the basic moral principles and virtues that the priest believes in. Throughout the film, the woodcutter, the bandit, and the samurai's wife all provide different, self-serving versions of the events, painting themselves in a more favorable light and shifting the blame or guilt onto others. Each of the characters manipulates the truth in some way, essentially showing the priest that individuals are inherently selfish and untrustworthy. Adding to his disillusionment, the priest is also exposed to the darker sides of human nature - murder, deceit, rape, and betrayal. Witnessing these acts of violence and immorality committed by the characters in the plot goes against the fundamental values that the priest upholds in his faith. Consequently, he struggles with the idea that humanity might be innately flawed and morally corrupt. Furthermore, upon learning the actual version of the events, he realizes that not only can people lie to others, but they can also lie to themselves to cope with their guilt or the choices they have made. This moral ambiguity adds another layer of complexity to the priest's internal conflict, making it even harder for him to reconcile his beliefs with the reality of human nature. Ultimately, the priest's faith in humanity is shaken because the different versions of the story uncover the moral weaknesses and selfishness embedded within human nature. He struggles with the realization that people can be deceptive, corrupt, or even capable of justifying their actions in the face of heinous crimes. This realization challenges the basic moral tenets of the priest's faith and forces him to confront the darker aspects of human nature that he did not wish to acknowledge before."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill? from the following article ? When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413‚Äì1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton.

Spectators are seated behind a blue wall. 2. There is a blue wall behind the spectators. The relationship between the spectators and the blue wall can be evaluated in terms of spatial arrangement and semantics of the language used to describe the situation. Regarding spatial arrangement, the core idea is to identify the position of the spectators with respect to the blue wall. In both sentences, the spectators and the blue wall are mentioned; however, their order of appearance changes. Considering the first premise: \\"Spectators are seated behind a blue wall,\\" the description states that the spectators are seated in a position \\"behind\\" the blue wall. The term \\"behind\\" implies that the wall is in the front, relative to the spectators' position. Consequently, the spectators would be in a position where they cannot see what is happening on the other side of the wall. Now, let's examine the second premise: \\"There is a blue wall behind the spectators.\\" In this sentence, the statement suggests that the blue wall is situated \\"behind\\" the spectators. The term \\"behind\\" here implies that the spectators are in front of the wall, with the wall to their backs. Thus, the spectators would be facing away from the wall, able to see what is happening on the side of the wall opposite to them. In conclusion, both premises describe different situations. The first premise suggests that the spectators are seated in a position where they cannot see what is happening on the other side of the wall, whereas the second premise implies that the spectators have visibility on the opposite side of the wall.

Weslake, who was laid off from his job, is working in a low-paying position at Garvey's pawn shop. Weslake has one friend nicknamed 'Turtle' who's homeless and is seen throughout the whole film searching for something to eat. One day, Dillard, who is an amateur musician, and Ramon, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who lives with his sister Maria, come to Garvey's shop. The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again.

Chevrolet, often referred to as Chevy, is a division of General Motors, one of the leading automobile manufacturing companies in the world. The Chevrolet Corvette is a widely recognized and iconic sports car that has been in production since 1953. The Corvette was first introduced at the General Motors Motorama, which was an auto show that showcased GM's new innovations and ideas. Harley Earl, the famed automotive designer at General Motors at that time, created the Corvette as a two-seat convertible with an attractive fiberglass body. The Corvette's design inspiration came from European sports cars like the Jaguar XK120 and the MG TD. Having been in production for more than six decades, the Corvette has seen multiple generations and redesigns. The generations (or series) of Corvettes are commonly referred to as the C1 through the C8, with each new generation representing changes in design and performance. C1 (1953-1962): The first generation of the Corvette, often known as the \\"solid-axle\\" generation, featured the initial design elements from Harley Earl. C2 (1963-1967): The second generation, also known as the Sting Ray, is one of the most iconic and recognizable designs. It featured a split rear window and the independent rear suspension for improved handling. C3 (1968-1982): The third generation had a sleeker design known as the \\"Shark,\\" which emphasized various aerodynamic elements that increased speed and performance. C4 (1984-1996): The fourth generation featured the first significant redesign of the Corvette's chassis, providing better weight distribution and handling. It also included a \\"targa\\" top design, allowing the driver to remove the center roof section. C5 (1997-2004): The fifth generation saw another significant chassis redesign and the introduction of a new, powerful LS1 engine, giving the Corvette increased horsepower and torque. C6 (2005-2013): The sixth generation brought back the exposed headlights, which had not been seen on a Corvette since the early C2 models, as well as enhancements in performance and cabin comfort. C7 (2014-2019): The seventh generation Corvette, also called the Stingray, took on new design elements that improved aerodynamics, handling, and overall performance. It also introduced a new LT1 V8 engine. C8 (2020-present): The eighth and current generation Corvette has made a radical departure from previous models with the introduction of a mid-engine design, shifting the weight balance forward, which significantly improves handling and acceleration. This new configuration firmly places the Corvette among the exotic supercars. Throughout its history, the Chevrolet Corvette has gained a dedicated following and has been celebrated as one of America's top sports cars. Its blend of power, performance, and relative affordability has helped the Corvette maintain its status as a symbol of American automotive innovation and prowess."},{"prompt":"At a doctor's office, two people come in to get STD tests.

The doctor takes a urine sample from each and will give them the results in a day or two. Would the complications be more severe for Patty or for John if it is found they have chlamydia?","completion":"Untreated chlamydia can lead to serious complications for both men and women. However, it's often traditionally considered more harmful to women as it can cause more serious issues with reproductive and overall health, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. That said, in men, untreated chlamydia can lead to a painful inflammation of the urethra and epididymis, both of which can also lead to infertility if not treated. It's equally important for both men and women to get tested and treated for chlamydia if they suspect they have it or if they're at high risk. It's difficult to say whether the complications would be more severe for Patty or John without knowing more about their individual health and background.

News article: Michelle Obama: 'In America we don't build walls to keep people out' Michelle Obama has delivered a withering attack on Donald Trump, warning a graduating class of New York students, and through them America, that those who seek to rule by intimidation and fear end up diminishing the hope and freedom of their nations. Related: Michelle Obama's commencement speeches: a compendium of excerpts Without mentioning the presumptive Republican presidential candidate by name, the first lady made one of the most sustained and potent attacks on Trump since he began his bid for the White House last year. She portrayed his brand of politics as un-American and dangerous, comparing him to world leaders ‚Äúwho stifle the voices and dismiss the potential of their citizens ‚Ä¶ who demonise and dehumanise entire groups of people because they have nothing else to offer.‚Äù Addressing the class of 2016 at the City College of New York in her 23rd and final commencement speech as first lady, she said: ‚ÄúGraduates, that is not who we are. That is not what this country stands for.‚Äù She went on: ‚ÄúHere in America we don‚Äôt let our differences tear us apart. Here in America we don‚Äôt give in to our fears, we don‚Äôt build walls to keep people out.‚Äù She alluded to those who ‚Äútell us to be afraid of those who are different, to be suspicious of those with whom we disagree. They act as if name-calling is an acceptable substitute for thoughtful debate, as though anger and intolerance should be our default rather than optimism and openness that have always been the engine of our progress.‚Äù Obama‚Äôs speech, possibly the last major public statement she will make as first lady, was a tour de force of a form of quiet political activism that she has made her own, almost without anybody noticing. At a time of unparalleled bitter partisanship in American politics, Obama has managed to pull off the seemingly impossible: while her husband has become a hate figure for the right and a subject of sustained racially tinted trolling, she has managed to keep above the fray while continuing to be a powerful advocate for greater racial tolerance. Her favorability rating has remained steady at an astronomical 70%, even at times when the president‚Äôs have slumped to 40%. The public adoration towards her is reflected in her 5 million followers on Twitter and Instagram, and by the crowd of almost 4,000 students before her under a grey New York sky who chanted ‚ÄúFour more years! Four more years!‚Äù as though she were the president whose term limit is approaching. Obama, who will be 52 when she leaves the White House, chose the venue for her final commencement carefully. Founded in 1847 on a hill overlooking Harlem, City College was the first free public college in the US with a specific mission to serve the children of poor and immigrant families, in stark contrast to its rich neighbour down the road, Columbia University. Today, it retains a highly diverse student body. Among Obama‚Äôs audience on Friday were students speaking more than 100 languages, 40% of whom were first-generation college students. Some have been homeless, and many work two jobs to pay for themselves throughout college. They join a body of alumni that includes Ira Gershwin, Colin Powell and 10 Nobel laureates. Obama said she had chosen City College for this poignant moment in her own life ‚Äì ‚Äúthis is a big day for me too,‚Äù she said ‚Äì for the very reason that it was what she called a ‚Äúdynamic inclusive place‚Äù. She said it represented ‚Äúthe power of our differences, making us smarter and more creative. That is how the infusion of all our cultures, generation after generation, created the matchless alchemy of our melting pot and helped us build the strongest, most vibrant, most prosperous nation on the planet.‚Äù A melting pot, she went on to imply in front of the students who at that point fell ominously silent, Trump was determined to destroy. ‚ÄúDespite our history, some folks out there today seem to have a very different perspective,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúThey seem to view our diversity as a threat to be contained rather than as a resource to be tapped.‚Äù She listed the creations of immigrants to America: Google and eBay, the telephone and the artificial heart, even blue jeans and the national anthem. ‚ÄúNational landmarks like the Brooklyn Bridge and, yes, the White House ‚Äì both were designed by architects who were immigrants.‚Äù The underlying theme of Obama‚Äôs speech ‚Äì the value of racial, religious and ethnic diversity to America‚Äôs future ‚Äì lies at the core of how she has moulded her undefined role as the nation‚Äôs first lady. The three great causes she has made her own ‚Äì encouraging young people, especially girls to take up higher education; supporting members of the military and their families, and fighting obesity ‚Äì relate to problems and challenges that African Americans in disproportionate numbers have struggled with over generations. Yet she did so without being accused of radicalism or anti-white animosity; rather she deployed humour and the power of her own example to bring others along. Her followers included not just liberals and human rights campaigners, but Walmart and big food companies who were cajoled into making major changes that would benefit particularly the poor and disadvantaged. Just last week she was instrumental in introducing a new rule that will force companies to disclose on labels how much added sugar their products contain ‚Äì a reform that she helped to achieve against considerable opposition from the food industry. The same gentle yet forceful persuasion epitomised her work on racial equality. She reminded the City College students that her family had come to America ‚Äúin chains‚Äù ‚Äì but she said it not as an admonition but as an exaltation that they follow her on to higher things. As Peter Slevin, who teaches journalism at the Medill School at Northwestern University and is author of Michelle Obama: A Life, puts it: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to imagine any other first lady shouting, ‚ÄòBlack girls rock!‚Äô as she did so joyfully on a BET awards show last year.‚Äù Though she‚Äôs mastered the appearance of being relaxed and at ease as first lady, and at times has been self-deprecating ‚Äì famously saying that she was ‚Äúprepared to make a complete fool of myself‚Äù if it did good ‚Äì the impression is misleading. She approached the role with the precision and determination of the Harvard-trained lawyer that she is. Slevin said that Obama is ‚Äúnothing if not disciplined. Aides say she is the most strategic person they have ever met. She is not a ribbon-cutter or one of those political spouses who gazes silently and adoringly from the wings.‚Äù Before Obama spoke, she listened to the address of the City College salutatorian Orubba Almansouri, who was born in Yemen and after coming to the US had to persuade her disapproving family that she should be allowed to break a tribal tradition and go to college rather than marry. ‚ÄúThey wanted me to go to the university of the kitchen,‚Äù Almansouri said, ‚Äúbut I fought to be allowed to pursue an education, for the right to be here today.‚Äù Obama said that Almansouri and her fellow Class of 2016 were ‚Äúthe living, breathing proof that the American dream endures in our time ‚Äì it is you.‚Äù As she ended the speech, preparing to return to her final few months in the White House, she urged them to find strength in the ‚Äúpower of our differences‚Äù. ‚ÄúTake an oath to make your city and your world greater and more beautiful,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat is the American story.‚Äù What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"In her final commencement speech as First Lady, Michelle Obama delivered a strong critique of Donald Trump's rhetoric and political stance, without directly mentioning his name.

She emphasized her position by adding, \\"Here in America, we don't let our differences tear us apart. Here in America, we don't give in to our fears, we don't build walls to keep people out.\\" Obama also stressed the value of racial, religious, and ethnic diversity to America's future. In her address to the City College of New York's class of 2016, she portrayed Trump's brand of politics as un-American and dangerous.

While digging for a project, workers from LexCorp unearth the spaceship of Doomsday, a genetically-engineered super-soldier. The creature is highly hostile toward anything that moves; it kills the digging crew and begins a bloody rampage towards Metropolis. Superman and Doomsday engage in a battle until Superman kills Doomsday and succumbs to his own injuries. Lex Luthor (James Marsters) kills his personal assistant Mercy Graves to ensure no one else knows of LexCorp's involvement. The world mourns and Metropolis honors him with a memorial. Superman's friends cope with his death in various ways: Jimmy Olsen takes a job at a tabloid newspaper, the National Voyeur, Perry White becomes an alcoholic, and Lois, who realized that Clark was Superman, visits Martha Kent for counsel. In Superman's absence, Metropolis is overwhelmed by criminals. Toyman uses a giant mechanical spider to hold children hostage. Lois decides to save them herself, but Toyman tries to kill her and a little girl. Superman digs out of his grave and saves Lois, apprehending Toyman.

Experts are concerned. The British Computer Society warns the number studying for a computing qualification could halve by 2020. The organisation - which is the professional body for the IT industry - says that would be a disaster for the economy. The old ICT course, which was the main way school students learned about computing, is being scrapped, with the last GCSE entrants taking the exam next year. The subject, which was described by critics as teaching little more than how to use Microsoft Office, is being replaced by the more rigorous computer science GCSE. But figures from Ofqual showing entries for the exam rising to 67,800 this year from 61,220 in 2016 have set alarm bells ringing. With 58,600 still taking the ICT exam, the overall number getting a GCSE computing qualification has fallen slightly. The British Computing Society says that when ICT disappears, the computer science exam will fail to fill the gap. \\"If we don't act now,\\" says Bill Mitchell from the BCS, \\"by 2020 we are likely to see the number of students studying computing at GCSE halve, when it should be doubling. If that happens, it will be a disaster for our children, and the future of the nation.\\" The other big concern is that too few girls are taking up the computer science exam - in 2016 they made up just 20% of entrants, while the figure for ICT has been around 40%. Prof Rose Luckin says the subject has an image problem. \\"Computer science is seen as more 'techie' and it is still dominated by men,\\" explains the expert from University College London's Knowledge Lab, who has been researching and writing about the teaching of technology for 20 years. \\"Many girls believe computer science and coding is 'for boys' and they do not see desirable career options that appeal to them.\\" What seems clear is that the computer science exam is far more challenging, both for students and teachers. That was of course the aim, but those who warned that ending ICT risked throwing the baby out with the bathwater may now feel vindicated. Drew Buddie, who is head of computing at a school near London, has always argued that ICT was unfairly maligned and was far more creative than its critics assumed. Now, he says, \\"it is clear that many 14-to-17-year-old students, particularly girls, are not attracted to such a specific and narrow course.\\" \\"The current GCSE in computer science has replaced the opportunities for creativity that existed in ICT with set programming tasks that have very few solutions,\\" he adds. The British Computing Society, which lobbied for the new GCSE, insists that it always argued for a new IT qualification to complement computer science, but that was rejected by ministers. The organisation says it is unrealistic to expect teachers of ICT to turn into teachers of computer science without significant training and support - and despite initiatives from organisations like Computing At School there has just not been enough funding to usher in this revolution. I put some of these criticisms to the Department for Education. A spokesman stressed that the new exam had been designed with industry experts to develop the computational skills needed for today's economy. He pointed out that the numbers taking it had more than doubled since 2015 and said \\"we expect that number to continue to rise while ICT GCSE is phased out. We are continuing to work to encourage even greater uptake of computer science, especially among girls.\\" But Prof Luckin says the situation is urgent. \\"We need to focus on understanding exactly why students are not attracted to computer science so that we can ensure an appropriately skilled workforce for the future, not least amongst the teaching profession,\\" she says. And she adds that the advent of artificial intelligence makes this mission even more vital. Five years ago, it seemed just about everyone, from teachers to business leaders to politicians, was in agreement about the need for radical changes in the way children were taught about computers. But today it is hard to find many who are happy with the speed and direction of the revolution in computing education.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If (2) The difference for a year or less between the elements (direct material, direct labor, factory overhead) of standard cost and actual cost., can we conclude that \\"There is a difference between a standard cost and an actual cost. \\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided in statement (2), we can conclude that there is a difference between a standard cost and an actual cost. We can elaborate on this by understanding the concepts of standard and actual costs and explore the factors that might contribute to the difference between them. Standard cost is a carefully predetermined cost of a product or service, which serves as a benchmark or a baseline for evaluating cost control and cost performance. It represents the ideal or expected cost that an organization aims to achieve when producing goods or delivering services. Standard costs are established by estimating the amount of direct materials, direct labor, and factory overhead that should be consumed in a specific operation or process. They are derived from various sources such as historical data, industry standards, and forecasts of future conditions. Actual cost, on the other hand, is the real or precisely incurred cost of producing goods or delivering services during a particular period. Actual costs are determined after completion of the production or service delivery process and are based on the actual amounts of direct materials, direct labor, and factory overhead that were consumed. There can be several reasons for the difference between a standard cost and an actual cost: 1. Variations in input prices: Fluctuations in the market prices of raw materials or changes in labor rates might cause the actual costs to differ from the standard costs. For instance, if the price of a raw material has increased significantly, the actual cost of production will be higher than the standard cost. 2. Inaccurate estimation: The assumptions or data used in setting the standard costs might be inexact or outdated, resulting in inaccuracies in the standard cost calculations. 3. Changes in production methods: Introduction of new technologies or modified production processes could cause discrepancies between standard and actual costs, as such changes might affect the consumption of inputs or the efficiency of the production process. 4. Variations in production level: Differences between the planned and actual production volumes could lead to differences in the allocation of factory overhead and, consequently, the discrepancy between standard and actual costs. 5. Operational inefficiencies: Factors such as equipment breakdowns, labor shortages, or waste of raw materials can result in increased actual costs. By comparing the standard costs and actual costs of a product or service, management can identify areas of inefficiency or opportunities for improvement. A favorable variance (where the actual cost is less than the standard cost) suggests efficient operations and cost control, whereas an unfavorable variance (where the actual cost exceeds the standard cost) indicates inefficiencies or other factors that have led to higher costs. In conclusion, the statement given implies that there is a difference between a standard cost and an actual cost for a year or less between the elements of direct material, direct labor, and factory overhead. These differences could emerge due to various factors and are essential to monitor and analyze for effective cost management and determining ways to improve operational efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Making a good job choice is almost as good as choosing a good life. So, choosing a job is one of the most important decisions to make in life. For my job, there are three important things that I will consider: The first one - that I must work in an area I like - is most important to me. Someone once said if you find a job that you enjoy, then you won't have to work another day. I would like to work in an area where I can be more creative. I would like to be the most valuable member there. All this is possible only if I like what I do. The second one is that the area of my work must lead me to solve some new and hard problems. I would like to stay in the same area for a long time. In order for this to happen, the work must provide enough problems. More than just working to live, I enjoy making a difference and trying my best for the whole progress. I would also like to be well _ for my hard work, so I can lead a comfortable life with this hard-won money. Then I can provide the best for my family. The third important thing is that I would like to work in an area that would help other people. The work in my mind is in fields such as the army, training or management. In such areas, I can help to develop the abilities of others and bring out their best. It would be a most satisfying job to help young people to become the best that they can be. When I become old, I would like to look back with a great sense of satisfaction that thousands of people have become better persons through my work. I accept the idea that no one should make a choice of a job suddenly or quickly. He should decide what he wants to be in the long run. Then, he should decide how he works towards it. He should study the proper courses, read the books and speak to knowledgeable persons in that field before making a job choice. A good choice will most probably lead to a better life. A:","completion":"Which of the following is an important factor to consider when choosing a job according to the author? A. The reputation of the company B.

Having ridden out of the city through the Saint-Denis Gate, he now was nearly home, and the hurt inside was cutting so deep that he thought it would drive him mad. He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane.

Options are: + not enough information + He wanted to make love to Nicolette + Diane had died + He was worried he has lied to Nicolette Answer:","completion":"Roland was sweating because he was experiencing inner turmoil and emotional conflict due to his feelings for both Nicolette and Diane. Despite the bone-deep chill of the January night, his anxiety, confusion, and emotional struggle caused him to sweat under his fur-lined mantle. The passage describes how Roland had pledged to be Nicolette's true troubadour and realized he loved her deeply, as he had not loved anyone except Diane. However, this realization caused him great pain and uncertainty. He believed that a person could only love one other person, but he found himself in a complicated situation where he loved both Nicolette and Diane. Throughout the passage, Roland reflects on the choices he made in pursuing Nicolette while also acknowledging his continued love for Diane. This emotional conflict and the possibility of having lied to Nicolette due to his unresolved feelings for Diane made him sweat, even in the cold winter night."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Passage:In the months following up to the September 11 attacks, officials at the Czech Interior Ministry asserted that Atta made a trip to Prague on April 8, 2001, to meet with an Iraqi intelligence agent named Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani. This piece of information was passed on to the FBI as \\"unevaluated raw intelligence\\". Intelligence officials have concluded that such a meeting did not occur. A Pakistani businessman named Mohammed Atta had come to Prague from Saudi Arabia on May 31, 2000, with this second Atta possibly contributing to confusion. The Egyptian Mohamed Atta arrived at the Florenc bus terminal in Prague, from Germany, on June 2, 2000. He left Prague the next day, flying on Czech Airlines to Newark, New Jersey, U.S. In the Czech Republic, some intelligence officials say the source of the purported meeting was an Arab informant who approached the Czech intelligence service with his sighting of Atta only after Atta's photograph had appeared in newspapers all over the world. United States and Czech intelligence officials have since concluded that the person seen with Ani was mistakenly identified as Atta, and the consensus of investigators has concluded that Atta never attended a meeting in Prague.

Title: Snakes on a Plane Movie plot: After witnessing gangster Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes to death in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane.

Article: I visited the nearby car factory today with my uncle, who works there. One thing I noticed was that most of the work is now done by robots. Welding , painting, testing, and many other jobs are performed by robots now. The whole dashboard of the car is now put into the car from above, through the windshield, by a robot. It would have taken two men to do this in the past, and it would have hurt their backs quite a bit. It got me thinking: is it a good thing that robots are replacing factory workers? On one hand, robots generally do a more accurate job than people. They aren't likely to make many mistakes, and if something goes wrong with one car, an alarm goes off. They do exactly the same thing, every time, without fail. A human worker is never able to do exactly the same thing every time. On the other hand, robots also reduce costs for companies. Companies don't have to pay robots wages or injury compensation if they're broken. If something in a robot does go wrong, it won't have to take time off work for a year, or even forever, as could happen to a real person if he breaks his back or burn himself while welding. The obvious _ to all of this is that it increases the unemployment rate.The company will have to bring in some very talented individuals who know how to operate the robots. Unlike regular factory workers, these intelligence workers usually demand a higher pay. Question: What is the author's attitude towards using robots in factories? Options: A: He is doubtful about it.

The dominating colours in the Cottage Garden are hot saturated shades of red, orange, and yellow, a colour scheme that both Sackville-West and Nicolson claimed as their own conception. Lord considers it as much a traditional \\"cottage garden as Marie Antoinette was a milkmaid\\". Here, as elsewhere, Sackville-West was much influenced by William Robinson, a gardener she greatly admired and who had done much to popularise the concept of the cottage garden. It contains four beds, surrounded by simple paths, with planting in colours that Sackville-West described as those of the sunset. Plants include a range of dahlias, a particular favourite of Nicolson's, and the red-hot poker, which he despised. In a 1937 letter to his wife he observed, \\"I think the secret of your gardening is simply that you have the courage to abolish ugly or unsuccessful flowers. Except for those beastly red-hot pokers which you have a weakness for, there is not an ugly flower in the whole place.\\"The Herb Garden contains sage, thyme, hyssop, fennel and an unusual seat built around a camomile bush. Known to the family as Edward the Confessor's chair, it was constructed by Copper, the Nicolson's chauffeur.

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Eagles, the Texans went home, donned their alternate uniforms, and played a Week 14 Monday night duel with the Baltimore Ravens. Houston trailed in the first quarter as Ravens running back Willis McGahee got a 1-yard touchdown run. Baltimore added onto their lead in the second quarter as quarterback Joe Flacco completed a 9-yard and a 26-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Derrick Mason. The Texans would answer with quarterback Matt Schaub finding wide receiver Andre Johnson on a 46-yard touchdown pass. The Ravens struck back in the third quarter as wide receiver David Reed returned the second half's opening kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown. Houston continued to hang around with a 24-yard and a 42-yard field goal from kicker Neil Rackers. The Texans tied the game in the fourth quarter as Schaub connected with wide receiver Jacoby Jones on a 7-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 5-yard touchdown pass to Johnson and a successful two-point conversion pass to Jones and the game headed to overtime. The Ravens won the toss, but failed to advance the ball and punted to the Texans 9. On the second play, Schaub's pass was intercepted by Josh Wilson, who ran untouched into the end zone. With the loss, not only did Houston fall to 5-8, but they became the first team in NFL history to have four games where they have come back and either tie or the lead, only to end up losing the game.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, R√©gine Crespin, Pl√°cido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and Jos√© van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, Andr√°s Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965.

Title: Wrath of the Titans Movie plot: Perseus (Sam Worthington), a son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), lives as a fisherman after the death of his wife, Io (portrayed by Gemma Arterton in the previous film), with his young son, Helius (John Bell). Zeus visits Perseus and asks for his help, saying that humans are not praying to the gods and as a result the gods are losing their power and becoming mortal and can no longer sustain the walls of Tartarus which are crumbling, and the imprisoned Titan Kronos will soon be free. Perseus, valuing his family's safety, refuses to get involved. Zeus meets his brothers Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), and his son Ares (√É¬âdgar Ram√É¬≠rez) in Tartarus. He asks Hades's help in rebuilding Tartarus's walls, but Hades rejects the offer and attacks Zeus. Ares betrays Zeus, imprisoning him and stealing his thunderbolt. Hades and Ares plan to make a deal with Kronos: in exchange for remaining immortal, they will drain Zeus's divine power to revive Kronos. The walls of Tartarus break, unleashing monsters onto the world. After killing a Chimera that attacked his village, Perseus travels to meet his father. He instead finds a dying Poseidon who informs him of the circumstances and tells him to find his Demigod son Agenor (Toby Kebbell) who will lead him to Hephaestus, who knows the way into Tartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his trident and succumbs to the injuries he sustained when meeting Hades and dissolves into dust. Perseus, Andromeda (Rosamund Pike), and Agenor set out to find Hephaestus on a hidden island. Agenor explains that Hephaestus created three weapons which Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon wield: Zeus's thunderbolt, Hades's pitchfork, and Poseidon's trident, and that these weapons can jointly form the Spear of Trium, the only weapon that can defeat Kronos. After an encounter with 30 ft. Cyclopes, the travelers eventually meet the now mortal Hephaestus (Bill Nighy) and reach the entrance of a labyrinth leading to Tartarus.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Select from: +negative +positive TEXT:Maslin Beach is a real nudist/naturist beach south of Adelaide, on the Fleurieu Peninsula, in South Australia. It is also the name of an Australian film that used the beach as a location. Maslin Beach is labelled a romantic comedy. This could be slightly misleading, as it is not a 'hilarious' film, nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense, but it does have light-hearted moments. Much as life itself, there are also moments of sadness too. It is also entirely shot at the nudist beach mentioned above, and nudity runs throughout the length of film. The viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal, and concentrate on the plot, not the copious amount of flesh. Simon and Marcie (Michael Allen and Eliza Lovell) arrive by car at a beach-side car park. They take their belongings to the beach, and while they are walking, a voice-over from Simon talks about his confusion about what real love is. The rest of the film is an exploration of this, framed by one complete day at the beach. The basic story is of what happens to Simon's love life, but there are also many other characters highlighted in several separate vignettes. When they arrive at the beach, both Simon and Marcie appear bored with each other. Marcie sees them as a 'Romeo and Juliet' romantic couple. Simon is just bored with it all. Next, we are introduced to Gail (Bonnie-Jaye Lawrence), Paula (Zara Collins) and Jenny (Jennifer Ross). They are walking down the beach together discussing Gail's chances of finding the 'perfect' man, aided by the 'powers' of a necklace that brought good luck to her Grandmother. However, there are many more interesting people on the beach, not all of them 'attractive' and young (part of the realism of this film). To service the beach's patrons there is a flatulent, short-sighted ice-cream salesperson with a van. This is Ben (Gary Waddell), who is a friend of Simon, and is also his unofficial counsellor. I would think that this character is the main comic element. It is hard to say though, as there is nothing about Ben that would make you laugh aloud, unless you were intoxicated, male and very young! Maslin Beach does have a major redeeming feature though, and that is that it does not dwell too long on any one subject. As the quality of acting is variable, the script is suspect and everything about Maslin Beach is cheap, the lack of continuity is a positive boon. In fact, there is something about this film (not the nudity) that I find appealing. It is hard to define what it is, but it could be something to do with its bluntness, and downright 'Aussie' attitude to carnal matters. The camera work in Maslin Beach deserves a mention. Sometimes it is very good, with some stunning static shots and 'pans' of the beach, cliffs and a sunset. As nudity is a major factor in this film, framing is an important aspect of the camera work. There is no sense of gratuity in the framing, meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not dwell on 'private' body parts. This helps to ease any sense of viewer discomfort from being within the subject's 'personal space', and makes the film more tasteful. Not an easy task, given the location for filming. Maslin Beach is neither a 'skin flick' for post-pubescent, testosterone charged males, nor a 'Mills and Boon' romance for under-appreciated women. Maslin Beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre. The actors are not 'attractive' in the Baywatch sense, and are just 'normal' people that you would see on the beach anywhere. It does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a tourism advertisement, other than perhaps to Naturists. Apart from the Australian accent, the filming could have been in any sunny country. What makes this film distinctly Australian is the fact that it is pointless (cinema verite?), and only Australian Cinema, and other medium sized National Cinemas, could consider such a rash option. At the same time, these medium sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the quest for identity, and a 'flop' is not going to damage their reputation too much. It is always possible, given that Maslin Beach is now a collector's item, that the film might become internationally popular, but it is very unlikely. During this critique, I have been sounding highly negative, at times, about Maslin Beach. This is not the real position, as I found the film very easy to watch. I enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people (and problems). The problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday, and a little low on spectacle. This does it no harm in my view, and I wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this. There is a connection here with the cinemas of Europe, and with French film in particular. They rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes, but with the everyday. Hollywood is in direct opposition to this, and rides the crest of the hyper-real action/drama/angst wave. The pace too, is much faster in Hollywood, but it is not reality. Maslin Beach is not exactly 'Jacques Tati' either, but it is on the right track, even if it does ignore issues of multi culturalism, equality, gender orientation and so on, that are of such importance in current cinema. I am sure that you will either love or hate this film, with little room for a middle ground.","completion":"+positive The sentiment of the text about Maslin Beach appears to be positive. Although there are some negative points mentioned, the overall impression is that the reviewer found the film enjoyable, easy to watch, and a reflection of near reality and real people. The reviewer appreciates the film's focus on everyday problems and situations and sees it as a refreshing alternative to the usual Hollywood fare. While acknowledging some flaws and shortcomings, the author still suggests that some people will love the film, and finds it appealing on certain aspects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is Kelli's boyfriends name? Movie title: Black Christmas Movie plot: On a snowy winter night on Christmas Eve, in the Alpha Kappa Gamma sorority house, Lauren (Crystal Lowe) is getting changed into her pajamas. In the next room Clair Crosby (Leela Savasta) is writing a Christmas card to her half-sister, Leigh (Kristen Cloke). Suddenly she hears something from her closet. She goes over to the closet door and looks inside. Nothing but clothes. She goes back to her card and sees that her fountain pen is missing. Suddenly a figure wraps a bag around her head. In the struggle, the figure stabs the pen into her eye.At a mental institution not far away, Billy Lenz (Robert Mann) is being served his Christmas dinner. He is locked away, rocking back and fourth in his rocking chair, safely in his cell that is decorated with Christmas lights. The orderly serving the food gets a scare from a volunteer dressed as Santa who is looking for the children's ward. Security guard J. Bailey (Ron Selmour) makes jokes to the orderly about Billy trying to escape every year. The orderly and Santa walk away, leaving the security guard alone in the hall. Billy opens the small window on his cell and places a present wrapped in newspaper on the ledge for the security guard. The security guard opens it to find nothing that interesting, except on the newspaper is written \\"I'll be home for Christmas.\\" The security guard looks into the cell to find it empty and Billy's chair rocking back and fourth. He quickly opens the cell and goes inside, to find a hole in the wall. He takes his flashlight and looks into the hole, as Billy comes from under the bed and stabs him in the neck with a candy cane.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Given the background: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs. and the situation: There are two exact copies of planets, Necrulon and Krankor, including the animals and plants on each planet. Recently though, people on Krankor have been wanting to have more space for new buildings. In order to accommodate these new buildings, they have started to cut forests and clear land. The people on Necrulon, however, decided to keep their forests and land rather than further industrialize. Answer the following question: Does Krankor have more or less autotrophic organisms than Necrulon? The answer is:","completion":"Krankor has fewer autotrophic organisms than Necrulon. To understand the basis for this answer, let's first define autotrophic organisms. Autotrophic organisms are those that can produce their own food using energy from sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide (CO2) through the process of photosynthesis. These organisms, which include plants, algae, and some bacteria, play a crucial role in ecosystems as they convert CO2 into organic compounds, release oxygen, and serve as food for heterotrophic organisms, which in turn consume them as their primary source of energy. Considering the situation described, the people on Krankor are engaging in deforestation and land clearing to make space for new buildings. These activities directly result in the reduction of the number of autotrophic organisms, as trees and other plants are cut down, leaving fewer organisms to carry out photosynthesis. In contrast, the people on Necrulon choose to preserve their forests and land, which implies they are taking measures to maintain the autotrophic organisms in their ecosystems. This decision aids in maintaining a balanced ecosystem, protecting the habitats of various species and ensuring a continuous supply of oxygen and organic compounds through photosynthesis. Since deforestation and land clearing have a significant impact on the number of autotrophic organisms, it can be concluded that Krankor has fewer autotrophic organisms as compared to Necrulon. The loss of these organisms on Krankor could lead to long-term adverse effects on the ecosystem, including reduced CO2 absorption, an imbalance in the food chain, and loss of habitat for other organisms. Inevitably, this would deteriorate the overall health of the planet's environment and life forms. Therefore, it is imperative to implement sustainable practices to counter these negative effects of deforestation and land clearing for the benefit of both planets and their inhabitants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Given the question: You are given a new situation: Tim is trying to boil two pots of water, pot A and pot B. Tim has a device which lets him see what the average kinetic energy is of the particles in each pot is. After examining each pot, Tim discovers that pot A has particles with a very high average kinetic energy, and pot B's particles have a low average kinetic energy. and a hint : The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the particles of water in the tub, explaining why the soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation ‚ÄúTemperature and Thermal Energy.‚Äù Please answer this question : Which pot is closer to boiling? The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question, let's go step-by-step and justify each step: Step 1: Understand the difference between average kinetic energy and thermal energy - Average kinetic energy refers to the average energy of motion of particles in a substance. - Thermal energy is the total energy of all the moving particles in a substance, taking into account both their individual kinetic energies as well as the number of particles. Step 2: Apply the hint to the given situation - The hint tells us that even though the average kinetic energy of particles in the soup is higher than the particles of water in the tub, the total amount of particles in the tub leads to a higher thermal energy in the water. - However, the hint is not directly related to the situation with Tim and the two pots of water. It just helps us to understand the concept of average kinetic energy and thermal energy. Step 3: Analyze the situation with Tim and the two pots of water - Pot A has a very high average kinetic energy. - Pot B has a low average kinetic energy. - To determine which pot is closer to boiling, we need to consider the average kinetic energy of the particles, as boiling occurs when the average kinetic energy of particles reaches a certain threshold. Step 4: Determine which pot is closer to boiling - Since pot A has particles with a very high average kinetic energy and pot B's particles have a low average kinetic energy, pot A is closer to boiling. This is because a higher average kinetic energy indicates that the particles are moving faster and are closer to reaching the energy required for boiling."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"To answer the question, let me break down the process step-by-step. 1. Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud: Suppose animals are indeed dying in wetter soil. 2. Sediment builds up over the remains: The wetter soil will likely cause the sediment to build up over the remains at a faster rate since it retains more moisture, making it easier for the sediment to settle and accumulate. 3. The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts: Wetter soil typically has more microorganisms, which can lead to faster decomposition of the remains. However, this step mainly concerns the decomposition, not fossil formation. 4. The remaining parts over the years are replaced with minerals: Due to the faster accumulation of sediment in wetter soil and faster decomposition, the replacement of the remaining parts with minerals may also occur relatively quicker. 5. A fossil is formed: Considering that wetter soil speeds up the sediment accumulation and mineral replacement, it can lead to more fossils being formed over time. To answer the original question, the supposed perturbation (animals dying in wetter soil) would influence the second effect (sediment builds up over the remains) by causing the sediment to accumulate more quickly.

Plants growth; (2). competition; (3). Adatation; (4). our star; (5). Experimentation; (6). Stagnation; (7). environment; (8). Information; The answer is:","completion":"(3). Adaptation. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. The teacher hints that evolution occurs by a process called natural selection. 2. The second hint given was that adaptation is the result of natural selection. 3. Therefore, Adaptation is closely tied to the process of natural selection, which ultimately leads to evolution. 4. Thus, from the options given, the process of Adaptation (option 3) would be the best answer to the question \\"What leads to evolution?\\" as suggested by the provided hints."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: The sexual assault trial of Warren Jeffs resumed Monday after a one-hour delay to review and reject a motion filed by the polygamist sect leader to have the longtime judge in his case, Texas District Judge Barbara Walther, removed. Jeffs told the San Angelo, Texas, courtroom where his trial is being held today that a revelation from God prompted him to file the motion against Walther, whom he said God labeled \\"a woman of evil intent.\\" \\"I am to now recuse you from this case,\\" Jeffs wrote in his transcription of the message he said was delivered to him by God on Sunday, according to the Associated Press. \\"Now sign order to recuse thyself; and allow this proceeding to stop ...\\" Judge Walther was forced to call a recess in order to have an outside judge review the 16-page filing from Jeffs, forcing yet another delay in proceedings as the slow-moving trial began its sixth day. Jeffs last week fired his attorneys and has been representing himself in court. Seven attorneys have appeared on his behalf since December. The switches contributed to a six-month delay to the start of his trial. The motion filed by Jeffs today marked the third time the 55-year-old head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) has tried to recuse Judge Walther from his case. Jeffs stands accused of sexually assaulting two underage girls in his sect and forcing them both into a \\"spiritual marriage.\\" The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. He faces a separate trial on a bigamy charge in October. The charges against Jeffs , the spiritual leader for the more than 10,000 members of the FLDS, a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism, were leveled after a 2008 raid on his sect's compound. Judge Walther is the same judge who approved the raid on Jeffs' compound that led to his eventual arrest and the charges against him. Monday's filing by Jeffs included what he said were 29 orders from the Lord when they spoke last week, including one in which God sent \\"a crippling disease upon (Walther) which shall take her life soon.\\" Walther, the Associated Press reports, contracted polio when she was younger and walks with a limp. \\"I, your Lord, say to you, I shall bring to light your evil intent now, before all people, to destroy my church on earth,\\" Jeffs wrote in the filing. Just as with the rulings in the previous two motions, the visiting judge denied Jeffs' claims that Walther is biased against the FLDS Church he leads, allowing Walther to continue the trial under the new Texas Supreme Court rules that no longer require an immediate hearing to recuse a judge after evidence in a case has been heard. Walther said a hearing would be held later. The new rules just went into effect Monday. The delay in the trial on Monday came on the same day that Jeff's brother, Lyle Jeffs, appeared in court as a spectator for the first time, according to the Salt Lake City Tribune. Lyle Jeffs is the bishop of Short Creek, the branch of the FLDS church located in Utah-Colorado City, Ariz. Silence, Then Outbursts From Jeffs After choosing to defend himself and then spending hours in silence in court on Thursday, Jeffs released a series of outburst in court on Friday, warning court officials that if they don't stop prosecuting him on two counts of sexual assault of a child, they would face an even bigger problem -- the wrath of God. After Judge Barbara Walther overruled Jeffs' objection to the proceedings against him, Jeffs, acting as his own lawyer, said he would read what he described as a statement from God. The judge dismissed the jury from the courtroom, and then Jeffs read the statement. \\"I, the Lord God of heaven,\\" Jeffs read, according to The Associated Press, \\"call upon the court to cease this open prosecution against my pure, holy way.\\" If officials did not halt the proceedings, the statement said, \\"I will send a scourge upon the counties of prosecutorial zeal to make humbled by sickness and death.\\" Walther said she'd remove Jeffs from the courtroom if he repeated the claim in front of jurors. The statement from God capped a day featuring a nearly hour-long outburst by Jeffs, begun with a cry of \\"I object!\\" in court Friday afternoon, followed by a launch into a passionate sermon defending the \\"tradition\\" of polygamy, a practice he considers the will of God. In opening statements the day before, Thursday, the only time the courtroom heard from the polygamist religious leader during was during a bizarre diatribe in which Jeffs spoke in sermon-like tones for 25 minutes on how his attorneys could not present a \\"pure defense.\\" After summarily firing his defense team, he sat alone, with his hands folded and head bowed, at the defense table, declining to make an opening statement, issue a plea or question witnesses. Jeffs' Friday outburst occurred while FBI agent John Broadway was testifying about computers and documents seized from the sect's compound. Broadway was on the verge of describing a list of people living at Jeffs' compound when Jeffs spoke up, saying the trust given to religious leadership should \\"not be touched by government agencies.\\" During his 55-minute speech, Jeffs, acting as his own lawyer, said polygamy \\"is not [all] of a sudden happening, it is of a tradition in our lives. And how can we just throw it away and say 'God has not spoken?'\\" \\"We are not a fly-by-night religious society,\\" he said. \\"We are a community of faith and principles and those principles are so sacred. They belong to God, not to man and the governments of man.\\" The jurors listened carefully, but didn't react to Jeffs' words. \\"We are derided for how we dress, how we go about our laborers in a common society,\\" Jeffs said, insisting that the Texas authorities who had conducted the April 2008 raid targeted him and his followers because they look different. He asked state Judge Walther to suspend the case and investigate whether his church's religious freedoms were violated, saying, \\"The government of the United States had no right to infringe on the religious freedom of a peaceful people.\\" After Jeffs had spoken for nearly an hour, lead prosecutor Eric Nichols said religious freedom does not extend to polygamy. Jeffs attempted to interrupt, and continued to do so until Walther finally dismissed the jury, ordering Jeffs to speak with defense attorney Deric Walpole, who had been asked to remain present as standby counsel. Jeffs' sect broke off from the mainstream Mormon Church 72 years ago. His 10,000 followers across North America consider him a prophet who serves as God's spokesman on earth. Sect teachings emphasize that polygamy is the key to exaltation in heaven, and that young girls and women are to be obedient to their husbands and serve them \\"mind, body and soul\\" to achieve salvation in the afterlife. On Thursday, the prosecution told jurors they have an audio tape of a sexual encounter between the 55-year-old Jeffs and a 12-year-old girl, and DNA evidence showing he impregnated a 15-year-old girl. \\"The stakes are very high for Mr. Jeffs,\\" ABC News legal analyst Dan Abrams told \\"Good Morning America.\\" \\"In almost all cases here someone decided to represent him or herself, it usually doesn't end well.\\" The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs, arrives at the the Tom Green County Courthouse for the second day of his sexual assault trial Friday, July 29, 2011, in San Angelo, Texas.

A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point. Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity, and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires. Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks. Plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration, but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.A wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 ¬∞C (212 ¬∞F). Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 ¬∞C (450 ¬∞F) releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 ¬∞C (720 ¬∞F) or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 ¬∞C (1,000 ¬∞F). Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 ¬∞C (1,470 ¬∞F), which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from... Paragraph: Near the city of Middleton, there are two forests. The Trine forest is a forest tightly packed with trees. Trine has hardly any large open spaces on the ground.

It is situated south-west of Bodmin Moor. - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around 43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century. - A conurbation is a region comprising a number of cities, large towns, and other urban areas that, through population growth and physical expansion, have merged to form one continuous urban or industrially developed area. In most cases, a conurbation is a polycentric urbanised area, in which transportation has developed to link areas to create a single urban labour market or travel to work area. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan. - Truro is a city and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. Truro is Cornwall's county town and only city, its centre for administration, leisure and retail and had a population recorded in the 2011 census of 18,766. It is the most southern city in mainland Great Britain. People from Truro are known as Truronians. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million. - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - Camborne ('Crooked Hill') is a town and civil parish in west Cornwall, UK. It is at the western edge of a conurbation comprising Camborne, Pool and Redruth. - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - Cornwall is a ceremonial county and unitary authority area of England within the United Kingdom. It is bordered to the north and west by the Celtic Sea, to the south by the English Channel, and to the east by the county of Devon, over the River Tamar. Cornwall has a population of and covers an area of . The administrative centre, and only city in Cornwall, is Truro, although the town of Falmouth has the largest population for a civil parish and the conurbation of Camborne, Pool and Redruth has the highest total population. - Bodmin Moor is a granite moorland in northeastern Cornwall, England. It is in size, and dates from the Carboniferous period of geological history. It includes Brown Willy, the highest point in Cornwall, and Rough Tor, a slightly lower peak. Many of Cornwall's rivers have their sources here. It has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic era, when primitive farmers started clearing trees and farming the land. They left their megalithic monuments, hut circles and cairns, and the Bronze Age culture that followed left further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows. By medieval and modern times, nearly all the forest was gone and livestock rearing predominated. - The Tamar is a river in south west England, that forms most of the border between Devon (to the east) and Cornwall (to the west). The area is a World Heritage Site due to its historic mining activities. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A watchmaker is an artisan who makes and repairs watches. Since a majority of watches are now factory made, most modern watchmakers only repair watches. However, originally they were master craftsmen who built watches, including all their parts, by hand. Modern watchmakers, when required to repair older watches, for which replacement parts may not be available, must have fabrication skills, and can typically manufacture replacements for many of the parts found in a watch. The term clockmaker refers to an equivalent occupation specializing in clocks. - John Arnold ( born 1736 probably in Bodmin , Cornwall -- died 1799 in London ) was an English watchmaker and inventor . John Arnold was the first to design a watch that was both practical and accurate , and also brought the term \`\` Chronometer '' into use in its modern sense , meaning a precision timekeeper . His technical advances enabled the quantity production of Marine Chronometers for use on board ships from around 1782 . The basic design of these , with a few modifications unchanged until the late twentieth century . With regard to his legacy one can say that both he and Abraham - Louis Breguet largely invented the modern mechanical watch . Certainly one of his most important inventions , the Overcoil balance spring is still to be found in most mechanical wrist watches to this day . It is necessary to point out that the brand name Arnold & Son used by a Swiss watch company has absolutely no connection to the original firm founded by John Arnold . It was from around 1770 that Arnold developed the portable precision timekeeper , almost from the point where John Harrison ended his work in this field . But compared to Harrison 's complicated and expensive watch , Arnold 's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable . Importantly , the relatively simple and conventional design of his movement facilitated its production in quantity at a reasonable price whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment . But three elements were necessary for this achievement : A detached escapement , which gave minimal interference with the vibrating balance and balance spring A balance design that enabled compensation for the effect of temperature on the balance spring A method for adjusting the balance spring , so that the balance oscillates in equal time periods , even through different degrees of balance arc - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire. - A clockmaker is an artisan who makes and/or repairs clocks. Since almost all clocks are now factory-made, most modern clockmakers only repair clocks. Modern clockmakers may be employed by jewellers, antique shops, and places devoted strictly to repairing clocks and watches. Clockmakers must be able to read blueprints and instructions for numerous types of clocks and time pieces that vary from antique clocks to modern time pieces in order to fix and make clocks or watches. The trade requires fine motor coordination as clockmakers must frequently work on devices with small gears and fine machinery. - Redruth is a town and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The population of Redruth was 14,018 at the 2011 census. In the same year the population of the Camborne-Redruth urban area, which also includes Carn Brea, Illogan and several satellite villages, stood at 55,400 making it the largest conurbation in Cornwall. Redruth lies approximately at the junction of the A393 and A3047 roads, on the route of the old London to Land's End trunk road (now the A30), and is approximately west of Truro, east of St Ives, north east of Penzance and north west of Falmouth. Camborne and Redruth together form the largest urban area in Cornwall and before local government reorganisation were an urban district. - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished.

Question: Question: \\"Which came later, colonies or states?\\" Context: \\"Beginning the Age of Revolution, the American Revolution and the ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrow the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, and then reject the British monarchy itself to become the sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the American Revolutionary War (also called American War of Independence).\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Considering the historical context provided, it is clear that colonies came before states. The Thirteen Colonies of North America were the earliest political organization that existed in the region before the formation of the sovereign United States of America. The Thirteen Colonies were founded between 1607 and 1733, starting with Virginia, and ending with Georgia. They were settlements established by European nations, primarily England, and operated under the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain. These territories were considered colonies as they were dependencies of their European mother countries, and their political and economic systems were closely linked to and controlled by those countries. During the Age of Revolution in the 18th century, tensions between the colonies and the British government escalated, culminating in the American Revolution (1775-1783). This period marked a significant turning point for the political identity of the colonies, as they began rejecting the authority of the British Parliament to govern them without representation. In their quest for increased autonomy and self-governance, the colonies came together and formed independent states, each with its own government and political system. The Second Continental Congress, held in 1775, marked the beginning of formal alliance and cooperation among the now-independent states against the British. The Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776, was a pivotal moment in the birth of the United States of America, as it announced the unification of the independent states and declared them separate from Great Britain. Following the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783, the Treaty of Paris was signed, which officially recognized the independence of the United States. From that point on, the newly formed sovereign nation was comprised of individual states, each with its own rights and governing systems, but operating under a federal government as a unified entity, the United States of America. In conclusion, colonies came first in the historical timeline, and the formation of states was a result of the American Revolution. The colonies rejected the authority of the British Parliament, established self-governing independent states, and eventually united to become the United States of America."},{"prompt":"Jesse took Ash at Austin's word when Austin told him the story.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose fish will die faster happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To answer your question, let's first analyze the given process step-by-step and then consider the impact of the perturbation hypothesis: Step 1: Acid rain enters the atmosphere and lands on water bodies and soils. Acidic components like sulfuric acid and nitric acid dissolve in water droplets in the atmosphere, creating acid rain. Justification: Acid rain forms when polluted air from industrial emissions and vehicle exhaust reacts with atmospheric moisture. Step 2: Acid rain makes water sources, like lakes and rivers, acidic. Justification: When acid rain falls onto water sources, it lowers the pH, causing an increase in acidity in the water. Step 3: The increase in acidity kills aquatic life, such as fish. Justification: High acidity levels can be harmful to fish as it disrupts their physiological processes, ultimately leading to death. Step 4: Acid rain also damages soils and nutrients necessary for plant growth, including trees. Justification: The high acidity of acid rain can dissolve essential minerals and nutrients in the soil, leading to soil degradation and making it less suitable for plant life. Step 5: Leaves of plants and trees are harmed by acid rain. Justification: Acid rain can damage the waxy protective layer on leaves, which can cause them to lose their ability to perform photosynthesis and retain moisture, ultimately harming the plants. Considering the perturbation hypothesis: The stated hypothesis supposes that fish die at a faster rate due to the increased damage from acid rain. This could have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effect: If fish die faster, the ecosystem balance in water sources may be disrupted, leading to potential problems like algal blooms, which could further worsen the water quality and oxygen levels, affecting the remaining aquatic life. Indirect effect: With the fast decline of fish populations, animals that rely on fish as a food source may be affected, leading to changes in the food chain and potentially causing ripple effects throughout other ecosystems. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of fish dying faster does have an effect on the overall damage caused by acid rain. Both direct and indirect effects can be observed, as it affects not only the aquatic life but also other ecosystems that interact with water sources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who bought the portrait of the wife of the man who was heartbroken and did not remarry? , can you please find it? Jos√©phine-√âl√©onore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de B√©arn (1825‚Äì1860) married Albert de Broglie on 18 June 1845, and they had five sons together. Although not high royalty, on the occasion of their marriage, they styled themselves Prince and Princesse respectively. Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eye witness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\"Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions. This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Mus√©e Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion. Ingres signed and dated the final picture at the left center \\"J. INGRES. pit 1853\\".Pauline died in 1860 aged 35 from tuberculosis. After her death, Albert published three volumes of her essays on religious history.

Here are the steps to find the answer: 1. Identify the heartbroken man who did not remarry: From the article, we find that Albert de Broglie was devoted to his wife, Pauline de Galard de B√©arn, and sadly, she died from tuberculosis in 1860. 2. Determine the wife's portrait: The article states that Albert commissioned a portrait of his wife after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. 3. Find the person who bought the portrait: Since Albert commissioned the painting for his wife, it is safe to assume that he was the one who bought the portrait of his wife.

Here is an article: The Lower West Side region known as SoHo, south of Houston Street, north of Canal Street, is in danger of becoming a weekend year-round Provincetown. It is an oceanless Provincetown in gloomy old stone and iron lining grimy streets whose physical character is completely camouflaged by tides of tourists flowing into an ever-increasing number of boutiques and restaurants, many of them chichi. It is so cheery and colorful on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon that one forgets that SoHo started in this industrial enclave more than a decade ago as a refuge for artists fleeing from high-priced Greenwich Village. But, no matter, it is a wonderfully alive neighborhood for weekend walking and gawking. The art galleries that anchor SoHo in character line West Broadway and Prince Street, the original SoHo main stems, and are rivaled by the spectacle on Spring Street as attractions for folk from suburbs and points west. Here is just a small SoHo sampling. MUSIC Greene Street is a popular restaurant at 101 Greene Street, near Spring (925-2415), and music is served with food and drink in its dramatically expansive premises, once a sanitation-department garage. Tonight, James Moody goes on with saxophone and song at 11 P.M., 12:30 and 2 A.M. There is a 6 cover charge. Tomorrow and every Sunday this month at 11 P.M., Jorge Dalto leads the six-piece Brazilian Magic Band and the singer Angela Suares in Carnaval-type and other music native to that country. There is a 5 cover charge. If you are out for a walk Sunday, brunch at Greene Street from 12:30 to 3:30 P.M. is good for openers. You dine to classic scores, Bach, Chopin, that sort of thing, performed by the Ann Harris Trio this weekend and by Mockingbird the next two Sundays. There are no minimum or cover charges. To round out this musical menu, Greene Street has just opened a large room called Greenspace. There is no food or drink, but each Sunday at 4:30 and 6 P.M. it offers the newest in experimental music. Today, Henry Threadgill appears with his saxophone interpretations; admission is 5. Brunch main items cost between 4.50 and 8.25, and evening main courses 10.95 to 17.95. Drinks are 2 or 2.50.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a title for this article: Over lunch, the day after the election, my husband brought up the ‚Äúf‚Äù word. You know, the one I‚Äôve thus far been refusing to say (hint: it rhymes with ‚Äúbiscal piff‚Äù). He had been reading the news and was wondering how badly this would affect us. I could barely choke down my broccoli as he read an article touting the end of the world as we know it. It wasn‚Äôt the last time I would hear that commentary this week. I received a number of emails, calls and yes, even Skype messages, passing along articles, links and tidbits about the imminent demise of the country due to the upcoming tax *insert your dramatic weather word of choice here*. To paraphrase the brilliant Mark Twain, those reports are greatly exaggerated. Let me see if I can separate reality from hype. I‚Äôll also add in a few big predictions for what that‚Äôs worth. First, unless something happens between now and the end of the year, taxes are going up. Let‚Äôs not hide from that. This was slated to happen no matter who was elected on Tuesday. It was going to happen because we have had the most ineffectual Congress in recent history sitting in office. And the chances that changing before 2013? Consider this: the House returns to session in mid-November before breaking again on November 17. After returning for a week or so, they‚Äôll take a week off for Thanksgiving and then try to adjourn mid-December. How much do you think they‚Äôll get done? Exactly. So for now, we‚Äôre stuck with the hand we‚Äôre dealt. And that means taxes are going up. If nothing happens between now and the end of the year, those tax increases and changes for individuals will include the following: Federal income tax rates head north. Federal income tax rates are slated to go back up at the end of 2012; the cuts were initially set to expire in 2010 and were temporarily extended for two years due to legislation signed in December 2010. Without any Congressional action, those cuts will simply expire. What does that mean for most taxpayers? Here‚Äôs a quick snapshot: To keep it simple ‚Äì since this is meant to be a quick look ‚Äì I‚Äôve only included the brackets for individual taxpayers. Basically, almost everyone is slated to take a hit. My big prediction: in the name of compromise (*cough*) the cuts will be extended for most taxpayers with some wiggling at the top (or other concessions). No more payroll tax holiday. The payroll tax cut was supposed to be a ‚Äútemporary‚Äù cut in your withholding to make up for the loss of the Making Work Pay Credit which expired in 2010. The cut was intended to last just one year, went into effect in 2011 and was extended into 2012. The cut officially reduced payroll tax contributions on the employee side of Social Security by 2%: instead of paying in at 6.2% for Social Security taxes, contributions, which were still subject to the cap, are 4.2% for 2012 (the self-employed also got a break): it is not on tap for 2013. My big prediction: the cut is allowed to expire but expect another fun ‚Äúholiday‚Äù/credit in its place, enacted sometime in 2013, officially annoying the new IRS Commissioner. Drop in federal estate tax exemption, increase in tax rates. Beginning in 2013, assuming no change the federal gift, estate and GST tax exemptions will also revert to the pre-2001 numbers: According to the Tax Policy Center, only 3,300 taxpayers ‚Äì or roughly .001% of the nation‚Äôs population ‚Äì will owe federal estate tax in 2012; that number will increase dramatically to 52,500 taxpayers ‚Äì or just under .02% of the nation‚Äôs population ‚Äì who will owe federal estate tax. So, definitely more people subject to federal estate tax in 2013 ‚Äì though, statistically, probably not you. My big prediction: the exemption stays put, but the portability (fancy tax term for allowing married couples to combine exemptions) disappears and the rates go lower. Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Increase. Oh, the AMT. The AMT is the most confusing of taxes ‚Äì and the most bungled in Congress. The AMT was meant to stop the extremely wealthy from using large tax deductions to avoid paying taxes. The AMT is not, remarkably, indexed for inflation. That means two things: 1, any increases in the exemption amount have to be approved by Congress every.single.time and 2, tweaks in the Tax Code (like the tax cuts) are essentially meaningless to those subject to the AMT. What Congress has done to ‚Äúfix‚Äù this is to put a band-aid on the problem, referred to as a ‚Äúpatch‚Äù every year; basically, the exemption is boosted. Without the boost, more folks are subject to the AMT ‚Äì and by more folks, I generally mean at least 20 million. I‚Äôm not kidding about the number ‚Äì at least 27 million taxpayers will be subject to the AMT in 2013 if nothing happens this year. It‚Äôs a problem every year (I‚Äôve been whining about it since at least 2005) and was a central feature in the 2008 election when McCain (like Romney) suggested eliminating the AMT altogether (he later backed off of the idea). My big prediction: expect another temporary patch. Capital Gains Increase. Capital gains tax is the tax paid on the difference between the sales price of an investment asset and the basis (usually, the cost). It can be tricky since there are a lot of exemptions (as with the sale of your home) as well as special rules that apply to the type of asset and the holding period (basically, how long you own the asset). When you hear folks talk about capital gains tax rates, they‚Äôre usually talking about long-term capital gains tax rates since those are considered tax favored (short term capital gains are generally taxed at ordinary income tax rates). Capital gains rates are low now ‚Äì at 15% ‚Äì which is considered favorable for investments. Without any action by Congress, those rates will go back up to the Clinton-era 20%. My big prediction: In a nod to Reagan, capital gains tax rates will be allowed to increase if income tax rates stay low. PEP and Pease Limitations Reinstated. Currently, as income increases, personal exemptions and itemized deductions generally decrease. The personal exemption phaseout (PEP) lowers the value of the personal exemption for married taxpayers with incomes beginning at 261,650 and fully phases out the exemptions when income reaches 384,150. The Pease limitations, named after former Senator Don Pease (D-OH), limits itemized deductions at the same thresholds. PEP and Pease limits were slated to be reduced beginning in 2006 and eliminated in 2010; as with the other tax cuts, the elimination of these limits was extended through the end of 2012. If nothing happens between now and the end of the year, the limitations return at the original thresholds (indexed for inflation). The result of those changes is basically an increase in the top marginal tax rates (those at 36% and 39.6%). My big prediction: the limitations are reduced or eliminated. Despite being a variation on plans pitched by both President Obama and Mitt Romney, tinkering with deductions aren‚Äôt popular and would be vehemently opposed by, among others, charitable organizations and the real estate community. Increase Medicare Tax. Under the current system, when you work, you pay into the Medicare system as part of your federal payroll taxes. You pay 1.45% of your pay and your employer pays in 1.45% for a total contribution of 2.9%. Unlike Social Security, there is no income cap, so all of your wages are subject to the tax; the cap on Medicare wages was removed as of January 1, 1994. Beginning in 2013, the Medicare tax imposed on high income taxpayers on the employee side will be increased by 0.9% ‚Äì to 2.35% ‚Äì for wages over the income thresholds (individual taxpayers reporting income over 200,000 and married taxpayers filing jointly reporting income over 250,000); amounts under the threshold will still be taxed at 1.45%. By way of example, if a single taxpayer earns 500,000, the first 200,000 is taxed at 1.45% and the next 300,000 is taxed at 2.35%. Self-employed taxpayers will have the same limitations. My big prediction: this stays as part of a compromise. New Medicare Tax. In 2013, Medicare tax ‚Äì the portion of FICA taxes that workers pay in addition to Social Security tax ‚Äì will be imposed at at a higher rate of 3.8% on investment/unearned income for high income taxpayers (same numerbs as before). Investment income includes exactly what you‚Äôd think but excludes distributions from qualified retirement plans, including pensions and IRAs. My big prediction: this disappears as part of a compromise. Realtors hate it. Top taxpayers hate it. Wall Street hates it. Easy target. Increased Medical Deduction Floor. Medical expenses which are reported on Schedule A of your 1040 are deductible in 2012 to the extent that they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). Beginning in 2013, taxpayers who itemize their deductions can only deduct those medical expenses which exceed 10% of AGI (those 65 and older keep the 7.5% floor until 2016). That means, for example, if you have an AGI of 100,000 ‚Äì and are under the age of 65 ‚Äì you cannot deduct medical expenses until you have spent 10,000 out of pocket. In that instance, if your expenses for the year total 9,500, you may not take the deduction; if your expenses total 12,000, you may deduct 2,000 (the amount more than 10,000). My big prediction: the floor rises as part of a compromise that leaves the mortgage deduction untouched. About 6% of taxpayers actually take the medical deduction and almost every President and presidential candidate from Bush to Obama to Romney has suggested some form of limit on the deduction. There, in a nutshell, are most of the significant tax changes for individual taxpayers. I know there are other tax changes that are considered imminent and ‚Äúnew‚Äù by folks like Breitbart even when they‚Äôre not. Those including the tanning tax (‚Äúnew‚Äù in 2010 and dramatically affecting Snooki); the Cadillac tax imposed on insurers, not individual taxpayers, for high premium insurance plans (slated to go into effect in 2018); and the individual mandate tax on the uninsured (beginning in 2014). While some of these will impact individual taxpayers, they won‚Äôt affect a majority of taxpayers, though they tend to make a nice headline or two. Snark aside about the crazy commentary floating around, I do think that we have some serious fiscal challenges again. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has warned, in its report (downloads as a pdf) that, with the current numbers, we‚Äôre on track for an economic slowdown ‚Äì including higher unemployment and lower taxable incomes ‚Äì even though the deficit will be cut nearly in half. It‚Äôs a worrisome trade off. We can‚Äôt keep borrowing and raising the debt ceiling to plug the hole but reducing tax revenues too much will likely have the effect of increasing the deficit. So what‚Äôs the fix? The major fix is offering consistency. We don‚Äôt need temporary patches and extensions. We need some comprehensive reform. Part of the fear over falling over the er, you know what, is the concern about the unknown. How can individuals and businesses plan without any direction? It‚Äôs like teaching my kids to ride a bike and then saying, just before they take their first ride without me, ‚ÄúSurprise! You‚Äôre riding a scooter instead!‚Äù It‚Äôs simply not fair to taxpayers, to tax professionals, to IRS (yes, I‚Äôm sticking up for them, too) and for financial advisors to constantly be in the position of having to shift gears and hedge bets (no, not that kind of hedging). We need clear direction. You want to avoid going over a real fiscal cliff? *There, I said it.* Try giving folks a road map. Want more taxgirl goodness?

They all live together in a pink and green trailer on the outskirts of Phoenix, Maryland, in front of which can be found a gazing ball alongside a pair of eponymous plastic pink flamingos. After learning that Divine has been named \\"the filthiest person alive\\" by a tabloid paper, jealous rivals Connie and Raymond Marble set out to destroy her career but come undone in the process. The Marbles run an \\"adoption clinic\\", which is actually a black market baby ring. They kidnap young women, have them impregnated by their manservant, Channing, and sell the babies to lesbian couples. (Channing is seen from behind, but apparently masturbates and ejaculates.) The proceeds are used to finance a network of dealers selling heroin in inner-city elementary schools. Raymond also gets money by exposing himself (with large kielbasa sausages tied to his penis) to unsuspecting women in a park and stealing their purses when they flee. The Marbles send a spy named Cookie in the guise of what Crackers thinks is a date. In one of the film's most infamous scenes, the two of them have sex while crushing a live chicken between them as Cotton looks on through a window. Cookie then informs the Marbles about Babs' real identity, her whereabouts, and her family, as well as information about her upcoming birthday party. The Marbles send a box of human feces to Divine as a birthday present with a card addressing her as \\"Fatso\\" and proclaiming themselves \\"The Filthiest People Alive\\". Worried her title has been seized, Divine proclaims whoever sent the package must die and her two associates agree.

In the pursuit of a common policy that promotes peace and stability, it is crucial to be courageous and honest in the face of challenges. War-torn regions, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), have long been exploited by various parties with little regard for their people or the environment. These actions have contributed to the continued suffering of the Congolese people, and it is essential to confront these issues head-on. Firstly, it takes courage to stand up against oppressive regimes and refuse to provide support to those who seek to perpetuate violence and tyrannical rule. Many world powers have long supported, either directly or indirectly, these kriegstreiberischen (\\"warmongering\\") regimes, further fueling conflicts and human rights abuses in conflict-affected regions such as the DRC. Denying support to such regimes would mean re-evaluating long-standing political alliances and economic relationships, which can be an uncomfortable and risky move for countries and organizations. However, this type of courageous decision-making is necessary if we strive for a more peaceful and equitable world. Secondly, honesty is key in addressing the persistent issue of multinational and European companies exploiting the vast natural resources of the DRC. The United Nations (UN) has made serious allegations against these corporations, accusing them of taking advantage of weak governance in the DRC to extract valuable minerals and resources without regard for the welfare of the indigenous population or the environment. To tackle this problem, there needs to be a concerted effort to promote transparency among these companies, holding them accountable for their actions. This would require a commitment to investigating those accused of exploiting the DRC's resources, cooperating with agencies such as the UN and taking necessary measures to prevent such activities in the future. Creating a common policy among nations to address these challenges calls for a combination of courage and honesty. Countries must be prepared to stand together to resist the influence of oppressive regimes, cutting off their support and pushing for change. Concurrently, they must confront the dark side of the exploitation of natural resources by multinational companies, ensuring that these malpractices are brought to light and stopped. Collective action is essential for forging a better future for the DRC and other conflict-stricken regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier. Now, I have a new situation: A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions. In her experiment, she is going to pour one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. After pouring the liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change. Pouring the liquid into beaker T, she observes a change in the liquid. Answer this question please: The reaction in which beaker has a higher activation energy? Answer:","completion":"The reaction in beaker R likely has a higher activation energy. Based on the background information, a higher activation energy results in a slower reaction rate, and as a result, the transformation from reactants to products takes more time. In this scenario, no noticeable change was observed in beaker R after the chemist poured the liquid, which indicates that the reaction, if any, is happening relatively slower or possibly not even occurring due to the higher activation energy barrier. On the other hand, in beaker T, the chemist observes a change in the liquid after pouring in the different liquid. This suggests that the reaction taking place in beaker T has a lower activation energy, leading to a higher reaction rate. The lower activation energy allows more collisions between the reactant molecules to have enough energy to overcome the energy barrier, leading to more frequent conversions from reactants to products. Consequently, the noticeable change observed in beaker T can be attributed to the lower activation energy of the reaction, making the transformation more frequent and noticeable. In summary, the reaction in beaker R likely has a higher activation energy since there is no noticeable change taking place after the addition of the liquid, suggesting that the reaction rate is much slower, if it is occurring at all. Conversely, the reaction in beaker T has a lower activation energy, allowing more reactant-to-product transformations to occur, leading to the observed change in the liquid."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"A bitmap, also known as a raster image or a pixmap, is a collection of pixels, which are arranged in a grid-like structure called raster. Each pixel holds a specific color value or, in some cases, a color gradient or an intensity value, forming an image representation when combined with other neighboring pixels. Bitmap images are widely utilized in digital photographs, icons, textures, and digital art for their versatility in storing continuous-toned images and intricate details. The term 'bitmap' gets its name as it functions as a two-dimensional array or a map of bits that are representative of the image's visual attributes. Bitmap images can be stored in various file formats, such as BMP, JPEG, TIFF, GIF, and PNG, with each format differing in compression algorithms, image quality, and compatibility with different platforms. The properties of bitmap images are determined by the following factors: 1. Resolution: Resolution refers to the number of pixels in a bitmap image, represented as 'width x height'. It usually determines the image‚Äôs quality and clarity. An image with high resolution will have more detail and be less pixelated, as it possesses a more substantial number of pixels per unit area than a low-resolution image. 2. Color Depth: Color depth, also called bit depth or pixel depth, measures the number of bits assigned to represent information about each pixel in the image. A greater color depth allows an image to render more colors, resulting in a richer and more accurate visual representation. Color depths can range from 1-bit for monochromatic images to 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits for grayscale and color images. 3. Compression: Compression refers to the reduction of file size without losing significant visual information. The main objective is to minimize storage space and facilitate faster file transfers. Compression can be divided into two categories: lossless and lossy. Lossless compression methods, such as that employed in the PNG format, retain all the image data and can reconstruct the image without losing quality. On the other hand, lossy compression methods, like those used in JPEG format, sacrifice some image data to achieve a smaller file size but with a trade-off in reduced image quality. In summary, a bitmap is a collection of pixels arranged in a raster grid, each storing specific color or intensity values. These images are widely used in various digital mediums, and their properties, such as resolution, color depth, and compression, determine their overall quality and application."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: When thirty-two-year-old tennis player Andre Agassi made to the final of the U.S. Clay Court Championship in April 2003, he set a new world record: he became the oldest player ever to be number one in the world's tennis rankings. It was one of the greatest achievements in Agassi's long and successful career. Andre Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of sixteen. His career soon took off, and in 1990, Agassi was famous around the world, though never having won an important tennis championship. Many people thought he was famous more for his long blond hair and colorful tennis shirts than for his tennis skills. They wondered if he could really win an important tournament. In 1992, Agassi proved _ wrong by winning one of the greatest prizes in world tennis--the Wimbledon singles final. His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world. Many people thought his career was over. Agassi and Shields divorced two years later, and Agassi made a comeback with a new trainer, a new hairstyle, and new determination. In 1999, he won both the French Open and the U.S. Open and ended the year back as the world's number one. By 2003, he had earned more than 27 million in prize money, making him one of the most successful tennis players of all times.","completion":"Question: Which of the following statements about Andre Agassi's tennis career is true?

Quatssack seems like a nice, ordinary town, but it harbors a dark and deadly secret: it is the home of the Children of the Yeti, an evil cult that worships a yeti that lives in the woods. The yeti was captured in the Himalayas and brought to the town as an old man‚Ä≤s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult‚Ä≤s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically. Five college students‚Äîfraternity brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe‚Äîare coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town‚Ä≤s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called \\"Tentacle Boy\\" and displays it as a sideshow, informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods. Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe‚Ä≤s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti. She accepts her destiny, and the priest gives her supplies for her mission. Meanwhile, Adam, Dick, and Sally, who are waiting for Emily outside, are ambushed by a redneck demanding the whereabouts of the Chosen One. Emily emerges from the church and shoots the redneck with a crossbow, and despite his seemingly near-fatal wound, demands that the redneck take them to the cult‚Ä≤s location.

The original statement does not provide enough information to derive the complete meaning of the first statement. Let us analyze both statements in detail to understand the differences and the limitations of the given information. Original Statement: \\"Three bikers are following a bus.\\" The original statement simply mentions that there are three bikers who are following a bus. It does not specify the direction with respect to traffic, the motivations of the bikers, or any other information related to their actions. It is a straightforward statement describing the position of the bikers in relation to the bus, but it does not include any reference to the traffic flow or the circumstances surrounding the situation. Alternate Statement: \\"Three bikers biking with traffic following a bus.\\" This statement introduces a few additional ideas and potential scenarios that were missing in the original statement. By mentioning that the bikers are biking \\"with traffic,\\" it implies that they are following the flow of traffic, adhering to traffic regulations, and traveling in the same direction as other vehicles on the road. This statement also suggests that the bikers are part of the general traffic, which was not necessarily the case in the original statement. Furthermore, the alternate statement uses the word \\"biking,\\" which focuses more on the activity of riding bicycles. While it is reasonable to assume that the \\"bikers\\" mentioned in the original statement were also riding bicycles, this detail was not explicitly mentioned. To conclude, although the two statements have overlapping ideas, they are not identical in meaning. It is not possible to accurately infer the information contained in the alternate statement from the original statement alone. Additional context and information would be required to accurately conclude that the bikers were biking with traffic and following a bus at the same time. The original statement only specified that there were three bikers following a bus, while the alternate statement adds information about the bikers' conformity to traffic flow and their participation in the act of biking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: WASHINGTON--A baby born with the virus that causes AIDS appears to have been cured, scientists announced Sunday, describing the case of a child from Mississippi who's now 2.5 and has been off medication for about a year with no signs of infection. There's no evidence that shows that the child will remain healthy, although complex testing uncovered just traces of the virus' genetic material still lingering . If so, it would mark only the world' s second reported cure. Specialists say Sunday's announcement, at a major AIDS meeting in Atlanta, offers promising clues for efforts to remove HIV infection in children, especially in African countries where too many babies are born with the virus. \\"You could call this about as close to a cure,\\" Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, who is familiar with the findings, told The Associated Press. A doctor gave this baby faster and stronger treatment than usual, starting a three-drug mixture within 30 hours of birth. That was before tests confirmed the infant was infected and not just at risk from a mother whose HIV wasn't diagnosed until she was in labor . \\"I just felt like this baby was at higher-than-normal risk, and deserved our best shot,\\" Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi, said in an interview. That fast action apparently knocked out HIV in the baby's blood before it could form hideouts in the body. Those so-called reservoirs of dormant cells usually rapidly reinfect anyone who stops medication, said Dr. Deborah Persaud of Johns Hopkins Children's Center. Next, Persaud's team is planning a study to try to prove that, with more aggressive treatment of other high-risk babies. \\"Maybe we'll be able to block this reservoir seeding.\\" Persaud said. No one should stop anti-AIDS drugs as a result of this case, Fauci warned. Question: Which of the following is NOT true? Options: A: The doctor treated the baby with a three-drug mixture.

What is the best way to: Eliminate odors in the garbage can.","completion":"To eliminate odors in the garbage can, follow these steps: Step 1: Empty the garbage can Before starting, it's essential to empty the trash can and remove all garbage from it. This provides a clean slate to work on and makes the task more manageable. Step 2: Clean the garbage can After emptying the garbage can, clean it thoroughly to remove any residue that might be causing the odor. You can use a mild detergent or a mixture of vinegar and water to clean the trash can. Make sure to scrub any tough stains or sticky areas. Step 3: Rinse and dry the can Rinse the garbage can well to remove any soap or cleaning solution thoroughly. After rinsing, let the can air dry or use a clean cloth to dry it, ensuring that there's no moisture left inside. Step 4: Neutralize the odors To neutralize any stubborn odors, sprinkle baking soda at the bottom of the garbage can. Baking soda is a natural odor absorber and can help prevent smells from lingering. You can also use activated charcoal or commercial odor neutralizers if baking soda is unavailable. Step 5: Use odor-resistant bags When you replace the garbage bag, it's a good idea to use an odor-resistant or scented garbage bag. These bags are treated to help minimize odors from developing in the first place. Step 6: Regularly maintain the garbage can To keep the garbage can odor-free, regularly clean and sanitize the can, following steps 1-3. Doing this will help prevent the buildup of odor-causing bacteria. Step 7: Control the sources of odor To further minimize odors, consider separating highly-odorous waste, like food scraps, and placing them in a compost bin. Additionally, you can double-bag particularly smelly items before disposing of them in the garbage can. This will help contain the odors, making them less likely to spread. By following these steps, you can effectively eliminate odors in the garbage can and maintain a more pleasant smelling environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If the students move the thermometer from one beaker to another and the mercury levels rise, is the temperature higher or lower? A group of middle school students is measuring the temperature of various liquids for a chemistry lab using a mercury thermometer. They have a beaker of boiling water, a beaker of ice water, and a beaker of water at room temperature. Hint: A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers.

Q:Personally I enjoy doing things outside. You know, the good ol‚Äô nature. One time, me and my buddy Alex and some friends decided we were going to go camping. (I know, basic camping story. Well not exactly.) We planned on going for the weekend. Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that‚Äôd help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so.

In addition to their aesthetic appeal, they possess a delicate fragrance that is both invigorating and soothing. This enchanting aroma has been utilized in various ways, such as in perfumes, cosmetics, and even culinary applications. In this guide, we will delve into the process of extracting the essence of rose petals through a simple yet effective method. This rose water, as it is commonly known, is a versatile ingredient that can be incorporated into various recipes, beauty treatments, and medicinal remedies. Materials: - Fresh roses (preferably organically grown and pesticide-free) - Medium-sized bowl - A second bowl - Strainer - Measuring cup - Clean cloth or cheesecloth Step-by-Step Process: 1. Gather fresh rose petals: Begin by collecting 1‚ÅÑ2 cup (120 mL) of fresh, fragrant rose petals. It is preferable to choose roses that are organically grown and free from pesticides, as this will lead to a more potent and uncontaminated final product. Early morning, right after the dew has evaporated, is the ideal time for picking rose petals, as they contain the highest concentration of aromatic oils. 2. Place the petals in a medium-sized bowl: Once you have collected the required quantity of rose petals, carefully clean them with cold water to remove any dirt or debris. Gently place the rose petals in a medium-sized bowl, ensuring they are not overly packed or squished together. 3. Add water to the petals: Pour enough water (preferably distilled or filtered) into the bowl to completely cover the rose petals. Since the petals will float on the water, gently push them down with your fingers so that they are completely submerged. Allow the petals to soak for about 30 minutes to help release their natural oils and essence into the water. 4. Strain the petal-infused water: Place a strainer over the second bowl and carefully pour the mixture through it, allowing the petal-infused water to nicely collect in the bowl below. This will separate the petals from the water, ensuring that only the liquid infused with the rose essence is retained. 5. Squeeze the remaining essence from the petals: Once the water has been strained, place the rose petals in a clean cloth or cheesecloth and gently squeeze out any remaining water and essential oils from them. This step ensures that all traces of the rose essence are included in the final product. Discard the spent petals. 6. Store the rose water: You now have beautiful, fragrant rose water at your disposal. Transfer the liquid into a clean glass jar or bottle and store it in the refrigerator for optimum freshness. The rose water can be stored for several weeks before it loses its potency or becomes spoiled. Applications of Rose Water: The uses of rose water are endless. Here are just a few examples: - Add it to various recipes, such as desserts and cocktails, for a refreshing, floral note. - Use it as a natural facial toner to soothe and rejuvenate the skin. - Blend it with essential oils and carrier oils for a luxurious, aromatherapeutic massage experience. - Incorporate it into your hair care routine to provide extra hydration and promote scalp health. Conclusion: Extracting the essence of rose petals is a simple and rewarding process that can be easily carried out at home. By following the guide outlined above, you can create your own rose water within a short span of time. This versatile ingredient can be used in countless applications, from adding a touch of floral elegance to culinary creations to enhancing the health and vitality of your skin and hair."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Can you believe your eyes? A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age. Martin Doherty, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, led the team of scientists. In this experiment, Doherty and his team tested the perception of some people, using pictures of some orange circles. The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people. The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle. As a result, they're more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Although still open which schools have since changed their names? , can you please find it? As Altrincham was part of the Bowdon parish, children from the township may have gone to the 16th-century school established at Bowdon; before that point, the town had no formal education system. A salt merchant from Dunham Woodhouses founded a school at Oldfield House intended for 40 boys aged 8‚Äì11 from the surrounding area. Sunday schools were set up in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Altrincham's increasing population prompted the founding of more schools during the early 19th century and by 1856 the town had 9 schools, 1 college, and 23 teachers. The introduction of compulsory education during the second half of the 19th century increased the demand for schools, and by 1886 Altrincham had 12 church schools and 8 private schools.Responsibility for local education fell to Cheshire County Council in 1903. Loreto Convent, the County High School for Girls, and Altrincham County High School for Boys, were founded in 1909, 1910, and 1912 respectively. Although still open these schools have since changed their names to Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, and Loreto Grammar School. Altrincham received evacuees during the Second World War, and it was in this period that St. Ambrose College was founded.Altrincham now has eighteen primary schools, one special school and eight secondary schools, including five grammar schools; the Trafford district maintains a selective education system assessed by entrance exams set by each school. Several of Altrincham's secondary schools have specialist status: Altrincham College of Arts (arts); Altrincham Grammar School for Boys (language); Altrincham Grammar School for Girls (language); Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic College (maths and computing); Loreto Grammar School (science and maths); and St. Ambrose College (maths and computing).

Answer the above question based on the context below: At that time, a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a \\"Bohemian\\" group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would \\"acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes\\". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected‚Äîpossibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: \\"Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ... We could at least propose to evict the female element\\".

That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys.

Article:Her subsequent fight for survival and renewed vigour on recovery have proved an inspiration to millions around the world. Her courage has won her the Nobel Peace Prize and led to her becoming one of those rare individuals who can go by their first name alone. But behind her international profile is one of a normal teenager - and a daughter of a loving, united and inspirational family. It's this story, seemingly mundane yet so fundamental to who Malala is, that fascinated director Davis Guggenheim - maker of the Oscar-winning portrayal of US Democratic politician Al Gore in An Inconvenient Truth - and led to his latest documentary He Named Me Malala. Guggenheim uses one-to-one interviews, news footage and animation to paint an intimate portrait of the Yousafzais's past and present - and in particular the influence of Malala's father Ziauddin on her life. The director explains: \\"People in the Swat Valley were being killed for standing up to the Taliban but there was this young girl who decided she was going to stand up to them. \\"People don't fully understand this vital element of her story or where that determination comes from. \\"My first instinct in making this movie was that it is very much about a family, about a father's love and about a girl who feels empowered to do amazing things. \\"If you cover that story, it speaks to girls all over the world.\\" Guggenheim filmed the Yousafzai family - Malala, her parents and two younger brothers - over 18 months. Much of the film takes place at the family's home in Birmingham, where they stayed following Malala's treatment at the city's hospital. But Guggenheim also shows Malala on trips to the Middle East and Africa as part of her work for the Malala Fund - an education charity she established with her father - visiting schools, refugee camps and addressing world leaders. Guggenheim is himself passionate about the importance of education and has made documentaries on the US school system. And as a father to two girls, he seems the perfect candidate to enter Malala's world - but it didn't prevent the nerves that preceded their first encounter. \\"I was walking on eggshells,\\" he says. \\"But they were just hilarious and joyful. They tease each other and I found them remarkably enlightened and infinitely curious. I would leave their house invigorated. \\"They have a certain freedom from having risked their lives and Malala lives her life even more fearlessly - the little things in life just disappear.\\" Malala's brothers Khushal, 15, and Atal, 11, are lively boys, dreaming of glorious futures and tirelessly jibing and arguing with their sister. \\"Look Malala, one day I will be an astronaut and a great sportsman and you will be known as my sister,\\" says Atal. Her mother Toor Pekai is barely visible on camera due to her Pashtun sense of modesty but, says Guggenheim, she is \\"100% in control. When a big decision is being made all eyes turn to her\\". And Malala emerges as a just a normal teenager, struggling to get the best grades at school and bashfully doe-eyed over Roger Federer. It's an endearing picture but what truly stands out in this family story is Malala's bond with her father, who very visibly supports her in everything she wants to do. It's an attachment that began even before Malala was born. In Pakistan, Ziauddin belied his slight physique and the difficulties of a stammer to become a passionate social activist and a teacher, even establishing his own school. In a patriarchal society in which \\"women are not known in public and their names are only known to family members\\", he was adamant his daughter would be different and named her after a legendary 19th Century Pashtun warrior heroine, Malalai of Maiwund. \\"Malalai had had a voice and I wanted my Malala to have the same - that she would have freedom and be brave and be known by her name,\\" says Ziauddin. And it was immediately apparent she was special, he says. \\"I hesitate to romanticise or make it something superstitious by saying she was born a saint or prophet but I felt an immediate attachment to her. I saw a light in her eyes. \\"She was very mature and sensible and mindful of others and was loved by the whole community.\\" Ziauddin put himself at considerable risk through his activism and received threats from the Taliban as a result. It caused Malala extreme anxiety yet she continued with her own activism and famously wrote a blog for the BBC under a pseudonym, about life in the Swat Valley. Though acknowledging he was a role model for his daughter, Ziauddin says he feels no guilt for what ultimately happened to her. \\"Guilt comes from when you do something sinful. When your basic human rights are violated and you don't stand up, that's a sin,\\" he says. \\"I didn't push my daughter; if I had she would have stopped. She would have said: 'Father you put me in a very bad situation, I got hit by a bullet, I am not going to do it anymore for you'. \\"But she became more resilient, more committed and I've never heard her utter a single sigh or a single word which implies complaint or regret.\\" And Malala - who has been left with some paralysis in her face and impaired hearing - vehemently backs her father. \\"My father only gave me the name Malalai. He didn't make me Malalai. I chose this life,\\" she says. As for the future, Ziauddin shows characteristic defiance. He is sure the family will go back to Pakistan for good, he says, despite the welcome and freedom they are all grateful to have received in the UK. And he has faith that his daughter will know the right path for herself to tread. Guggenheim fully agrees. \\"When you do the DNA of Malala, she is a potent mix of both her parents. She gets her sense of mission from her father but her moral fibre, her religious clarity and forgiveness from her mother,\\" he says. \\"Anything is possible for Malala. She is wholly equipped to be a leader and she is completely unique in that, when the big decisions are being made about girls education, she is the only young person at the table. \\"She's a voice for all those girls who don't have a voice. She'll be that for a very long time.\\" He Named Me Malala opens in the UK on 6 November. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"He Named Me Malala is a documentary by director Davis Guggenheim that provides an intimate portrait of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai and her family. Guggenheim uses interviews, news footage, and animation to explore the Yousafzai family's past and present, with a particular focus on Malala's father, Ziauddin, and his influence on her life. Filmed over 18 months, the documentary follows Malala's family in their Birmingham home, as well as during her trips to the Middle East and Africa for her education-focused Malala Fund charity. The film highlights Malala's bond with her father and the influence he had in shaping her into the fierce advocate for girls' education that she is today. Ziauddin named Malala after a legendary Pashtun warrior heroine, Malalai of Maiwand, and encouraged her to have freedom, bravery, and be known by her name. Malala's activism began under the guidance of her father, who himself faced risks and threats from the Taliban due to his own socially progressive activism. Although Guggenheim's lens captures the extraordinary nature of the Yousafzai family, he also shows the human side of Malala as a normal teenager and sister to her two younger brothers. The documentary also emphasizes Malala's resilience and determination in the face of adversity, something that comes from her strong familial support and her parents' influence in her life. He Named Me Malala is not only the story of the young activist, but it is also a powerful message to girls all over the world, showing the importance of family values and the potential for one person to create meaningful change.

Write an article that answers the following question: In 1860 how many people in Singapore were not Chinese?","completion":"Title: In 1860, Who Were the Non-Chinese People in Singapore? Hello little friends! Today, we are going to learn about the people who lived in Singapore back in 1860. Singapore is a beautiful island country in Asia with many different people living there. In 1860, many people in Singapore were Chinese, but there were others who were not Chinese. Let's find out who they were and how many there were! In 1860, there were about 57,000 people living in Singapore. Among them, around 19,000 were not Chinese. Can you imagine that? There were almost as many non-Chinese people as there were apples in a big apple tree! Now, let's learn about these people who were not Chinese. They came from different places and had different cultures. Here are the main groups of non-Chinese people in Singapore in 1860: 1. Malays ‚Äì Malays are people who come from a region called \\"Malay Peninsula\\" and the nearby islands. In 1860, there were about 13,750 Malays living in Singapore. That's more than half of the non-Chinese people! 2. Indians ‚Äì Just like their name suggests, these people came from India. There were around 4,150 Indians in Singapore in 1860 which is about one-fifth of the non-Chinese population. 3. Europeans ‚Äì Europeans are people from countries that are in the continent called Europe. Around 1,100 Europeans were living in Singapore in 1860. So, there you have it! In 1860, about 19,000 people in Singapore were not Chinese, and they were mainly Malays, Indians, and Europeans. Isn't it fascinating to learn about the different people who lived together in Singapore almost 200 years ago?

Buffs of the adult western that flourished in the 1950s try and trace its origins to the film that kicked off the syndrome. Of course, we can go back to Howard Hawks's Red River (1948) or further still to John Ford's My Darling Clementine (1946), but if we want to stick with this single decade, then it has to be one of a couple of films made in that era's initial year. One is \\"The Gunfighter,\\" an exquisitely grim tale of a famed gunslinger (Ringo) facing his last shootout. Another from that same year is \\"Winchester '73,\\" and it's worth noting that Millard Mitchell appears in both as grim, mustached, highly realistic range riders. In The Gunfighter, he's the town marshal expected to arrest Ringo but once rode with him in an outlaw gang. In Winchester, he's the sidekick to Jimmy Stewart, a kind of Horatio to Stewart's Hamlet in this epic/tragic tale. The plot is simple enough: Stewart's lonesome cowpoke wins a remarkable Winchester in a shooting match, beating the meanest man in the west (Stephen McNally), who is actually his own brother and caused the death of their father. When the brother steals the gun, Stewart and Mitchell go after him in a cowboy odyssey that takes them all across the frontier, meeting up with both outlaws and Indians. (In one wonderful bit, two future stars - Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis - play an Indian chief and a U.S. cavalry soldier - during a well staged pitched-battle. Dan Duryea steals the whole show as a giggling outlaw leader, while Shelly Winters, just before she began to gain weight, is fine as the shady lady who ties all the plots together. Today, filmmakers would go on for about four hours to bring such an ambitious idea to the screen, but Anthony Mann does so in an extremely economical amount of time, with not a minute wasted. Such western legends as Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp (terrifically played by Will Geer) make brief appearances, adding to the historicity as well as the epic nature. The final battle between good and bad brothers, high atop a series of jutting rock canyons, is now legendary among western buffs. It's also worth noting that Stewart, however much associated he became with western films, does what is actually his first western leading man role here - yes, he was in Destry Rides Again eleven years earlier, but was cast in that comedy spoof because he seemed so WRONG for westerns! Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"I would say this review is predominantly positive.

In the mid-19th century, Serbian (led by self-taught writer and folklorist Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá) and most Croatian writers and linguists (represented by the Illyrian movement and led by Ljudevit Gaj and ƒêuro Daniƒçiƒá), proposed the use of the most widespread dialect, Shtokavian, as the base for their common standard language. Karad≈æiƒá standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, and Gaj and Daniƒçiƒá standardized the Croatian Latin alphabet, on the basis of vernacular speech phonemes and the principle of phonological spelling. In 1850 Serbian and Croatian writers and linguists signed the Vienna Literary Agreement, declaring their intention to create a unified standard. Thus a complex bi-variant language appeared, which the Serbs officially called \\"Serbo-Croatian\\" or \\"Serbian or Croatian\\" and the Croats \\"Croato-Serbian\\", or \\"Croatian or Serbian\\". Yet, in practice, the variants of the conceived common literary language served as different literary variants, chiefly differing in lexical inventory and stylistic devices. The common phrase describing this situation was that Serbo-Croatian or \\"Croatian or Serbian\\" was a single language. During the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the language of all three nations was called \\"Bosnian\\" until the death of administrator von K√°llay in 1907, at which point the name was changed to \\"Serbo-Croatian\\".

Signs of an allergic reaction include: Watery eyes Eyes that hurt Red eyes Swollen eyes Most people know when they have an eyelash in their eye because it feels like something is in your eye. Eye mites can also make you feel like a foreign body is in your eye. Your eyelids may also feel itchy and you might experience a burning sensation in your eyes. You should also consider if your vision has changed. If your eyesight becomes blurry, you may have eye mites. Unfortunately, you won't be able to look at your eyelashes and eyelids and tell if you have eye mites. They're so small that they can only be seen under magnification. But, you may notice your eyelids become thicker or crusty if you have eye mites. And, you might lose eyelashes if you have mites. Your eyelid can also look red if you have eye mites, especially along the margin or edge. The risk of eye mites increases as you age. Some studies estimate that over 80% of people over the age of 60 have eye mites and that these tiny creatures may are present on many children too. People with the skin disorder rosacea often have eye mites. Eye mites are just as common in men as in women with a similar distribution worldwide regardless of race. If you experience any of these symptoms, you might have eye mites. Unfortunately, they're so small that you can't tell if you have them just by looking at your eyes. And, since many of these symptoms could be caused by other eye problems, you'll have to go to the doctor to know if you have eye mites. You can also ask your eye doctor to make an eye mites diagnosis or check your eyes for another eye condition that could be causing your symptoms. Your doctor will have you sit at a slit-lamp. If you've ever had your eyes checked, the eye doctor used a slit-lamp. You sit with your chin and forehead on a support while a bright light and microscope examine the front of your eye. The doctor will look for the small mites which will be attached to the base of your eyelash. Sometimes, the doctor will pull out an eyelash or two to examine under a microscope. Some doctors will pull an eyelash in order to show you the mites under the microscope. If the doctor doesn't see any mites, you'll be checked for other conditions that could be causing your eye irritation (like allergies or a foreign object in your eyes). Summary:","completion":"The article discusses eye mites, which carry bacteria that can cause infection, particularly in individuals with rosacea, and highlights the various symptoms associated with their presence, such as watery, red, swollen eyes, and foreign body sensation. It emphasizes the importance of consulting a doctor for an eye mite diagnosis or examination of other potential eye conditions, as the mites are too small to be detected without magnification. The risk of having eye mites increases with age, and they are equally common among men and women across all races. Doctors use a slit-lamp to examine for the presence of these mites, sometimes pulling out an eyelash for further microscopic evaluation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - acknowledgment - price - fresh produce - smooth skin - good credit The answer to this question is:","completion":"fresh produce. There are several reasons why the person might prefer going to the farmer's market over the grocery store. While all the given options might play a role, the most suitable option that stands out is fresh produce. Farmer's markets are known for offering locally sourced, fresh, and high-quality fruits, vegetables, and other products. Farmer's markets usually involve direct interaction between the farmers and the customers, allowing the customers to ask questions about the produce and how it was grown, thus promoting trust and transparency. Many people prioritize health and sustainability, leading them to prefer fresh and organic products available in these markets compared to the processed and packaged products found in grocery stores. Also, by supporting farmer's markets, customers are contributing to their local economy and encouraging food options that have lower carbon footprints. Since the produce has traveled shorter distances, it is not subjected to long transit times or multiple middlemen before reaching the consumer. As a result, the freshness of the produce is maintained, often resulting in better tasting, more nutritious, and longer-lasting fruits and vegetables. Price can also be an influencing factor, as sometimes farmer's markets may offer competitive pricing since the goods are sold directly from the source without the need for additional distribution channels. Additionally, the atmosphere of farmer's markets is generally more relaxed and enjoyable, providing a more personal and engaging shopping experience than what can be found in most traditional grocery stores. In conclusion, the primary reason the person preferred going to the farmer's market over the grocery store is likely due to the availability of fresh produce. The advantages of choosing farmer's markets are numerous, including the quality of products, contributing to local economies, promoting sustainability, potentially lower prices, and providing an enjoyable and personal shopping experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thousands of displaced Congolese on Tuesday line the road near the Kibati camp north of Goma, Congo. \\"Five rockets were fired on two U.N. armored personnel carriers that were part of the convoy of MONUC Blue Helmets near Kalengera,\\" according to a report on the Web site of the U.N. Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, known by its French acronym, MONUC. \\"MONUC reiterates that under its mandate it will continue to intervene with all of its means to ensure the protection of civilians and to protect the urban centers of North Kivu,\\" MONUC said, referring to the province in eastern Congo. The attacks by rebels of the National Congress for the Defense of People, or CNDP, led civilians to seek refuge in Goma, the provincial capital, where national army forces surround the city, said MONUC spokesman Jean-Paul Dietrich. He said U.N. helicopters flew overhead to provide cover until darkness fell, when the aircraft were grounded for the night. Dietrich said a U.N. official in Goma reported that the town of Rutshuru had been captured, although he had not confirmed the information with the military. Rutshuru is a territorial capital about 37 miles (60 kilometers) north of Goma. The U.N. convoy that officials said was attacked was providing security on the road from Rutshuru. Dietrich said clashes between the rebels and government forces had taken place during the day in scattered locations. Bertrand Bisimwa, a spokesman for the rebels, told The Associated Press the rebels' front lines are within within 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Goma, a city of 600,000. U.N. refugee agency spokesman Ron Redmond said the Kibati camp for displaced persons tripled in size in a matter of hours Tuesday, The AP reported. Congolese hurled rocks at U.N. armored personnel carriers that were headed away from the fighting, according to an AP report. Watch as Congolese throw rocks at tanks ¬ª. \\"What are they doing? They are supposed to protect us,\\" AP quoted displaced person Jean-Paul Maombi as saying. Between 800,000 and 1 million displaced persons are living in camps run by the United Nations and other organizations in the area, Dietrich said, including about 150,000 people who came to the camps after August 28. \\"I think right now it's a very delicate situation,\\" he added. The spokeswoman for the U.N. mission in Goma, Sylvie van den Wildenberg, said the situation in Goma is under control for now. \\"We have reinforced our presence there.\\" Watch as crowds target U.N. offices in Goma ¬ª. On Monday, U.N. gunships supported army forces as they fired on the CNDP rebels in an effort to halt their advance on Kibumba, to the north, Wildenberg said. \\"We have put all our resources on alert to deter any further progression, trying to contain the aggression in those areas. CNDP is not listening to anyone anymore,\\" she said. Renewed fighting erupted Sunday when the CNDP, led by renegade Gen. Laurent Nkunda, seized a major military camp and gorilla park just one week after a U.N.-brokered peace accord, according to U.N. and park officials. The rebels, according to Wildenberg, are surrounding areas where displaced persons are housed as a \\"strategy used to put more pressure on government and on the international community to get some of their requests satisfied. This is unacceptable and a violation of humanitarian law.\\" Although the civil war in Congo officially ended in 2003, recent fighting in eastern Congo between government forces and rebels has displaced thousands.

But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore.

Answer the following question: The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful. Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment ‚Äì even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected ‚Äì mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. According to the above context, answer the following question. What bad effect does being busy bring?

Many predators specialize in hunting only one species of prey. Others are more opportunistic and will kill and eat almost anything (examples: humans, leopards, dogs and alligators). The specialists are usually particularly well suited to capturing their preferred prey. The prey in turn, are often equally suited to escape that predator. This is called an evolutionary arms race and tends to keep the populations of both species in equilibrium. Some predators specialize in certain classes of prey, not just single species. Some will switch to other prey (with varying degrees of success) when the preferred target is extremely scarce, and they may also resort to scavenging or a herbivorous diet if possible.[citation needed] Please answer a question about this article.

Would \\"KSAs are brief and focused essays about one's career and educational background that presumably qualify one to perform the duties of the position being applied for.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) are essential factors that, when combined, make up an individual's specific capabilities to perform a certain task or job. These three components are crucial in evaluating an individual's qualifications, expertise, and potential to carry out the responsibilities associated with a given position. Now, let's delve into a deeper understanding of each component: 1. Knowledge: Knowledge refers to the accumulation of facts, principles, theories, and the practical understanding of a specific subject or discipline. It is typically acquired through education, training, and experience. Knowledge enables a person to make informed decisions and respond effectively to various situations in the workplace. In essence, it is the foundation upon which skills and abilities are built. 2. Skills: Skills are the practical application of knowledge to execute specific tasks or activities. These are developed through training, practice, and experience. Skills can be classified as either hard skills or soft skills. Hard skills are more quantifiable and industry-specific, such as programming, design, or machinery operation. On the other hand, soft skills are non-technical, interpersonal attributes, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. 3. Abilities: Abilities are innate or acquired traits or attributes that enable a person to perform tasks effectively and efficiently. They are the natural talents and proficiencies that an individual possesses, which can be enhanced with education, training, and experience. Examples of abilities include critical thinking, adaptability, and decision-making. The statement \\"KSAs are brief and focused essays about one's career and educational background that presumably qualify one to perform the duties of the position being applied for\\" is a reasonable but incomplete answer. While it is true that KSAs are often assessed and presented as part of a job application process through essays or other written formats, the concept of KSAs surpasses the scope of this definition. In the context of a job application, KSA essays or statements allow applicants to demonstrate their Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities related to the position they are applying for. These statements must provide concrete examples of how the applicant meets the required qualifications and criteria, enabling the employer to evaluate the applicant's suitability better. In conclusion, Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) are essential components of an individual's comprehensive profile that determine their capacity and potential to perform a specific job. While KSA statements are often used in job applications, it is crucial to remember that the concept of KSAs is broader than merely assessing career and educational background. Employers and employees alike benefit from a thorough understanding and continuous development of their KSAs for optimal performance and career growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Vi√±olas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Vi√±olas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Cell chip business\\" correctly answer the question \\"What will IBM be producing in upstate NY?\\"?","completion":"Yes, the response \\"Cell chip business\\" can be considered a correct answer to the question \\"What will IBM be producing in upstate NY?\\", although it can be more accurately described as \\"a wide range of specialized semiconductors.\\" The paragraph mentions that the new IBM semiconductor factory will produce various specialized semiconductors used in different electronic devices, including mainframe computers, cell phones, and video-game consoles. This implies that IBM will be involved in producing cell chips among other types of semiconductor chips at the facility in upstate New York."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: For our K9 trainers, it‚Äôs imperative that the dogs enjoy the job they‚Äôre doing. Sometimes, even when a pup tests well and they successfully learn how to detect explosive odors, they make it clear that being an explosive detection K9 is not the life for them. Such is the case for one of the fall 2017 ‚Äúpuppy class‚Äù pups. We are sad to announce that Lulu has been dropped from the program. A few weeks into training, Lulu began to show signs that she wasn‚Äôt interested in detecting explosive odors. All dogs, just like most human students, have good days and bad days when learning something new. The same is true during our puppy classes. A pup might begin acting lazy, guessing where the odors are, or just showing a general disregard for whatever is being taught at the moment. Usually it lasts for a day, maybe two. There can be a million reasons why a particular dog has a bad day, and the trainers become doggy psychologists trying to figure out what will help the dog come out of its funk. Sometimes the pup is bored and just needs extra playtime or more challenges, sometimes the dog need a little break, and sometimes it‚Äôs a minor medical condition like a food allergy requiring switching to a different kibble. After a few days, the trainers work the pup through whatever issue has arisen, and the dog is back eagerly and happily ready to continue training. Lulu enjoying retirement with her best buddy, Harry. But for some dogs, like Lulu, it becomes clear that the issue isn‚Äôt temporary. Instead, this just isn‚Äôt the job they are meant for. Lulu was no longer interested in searching for explosives. Even when they could motivate her with food and play to search, she was clearly not enjoying herself any longer. Our trainers‚Äô top concern is the physical and mental well-being of our dogs, so they made the extremely difficult decision to do what‚Äôs best for Lulu and drop her from the program. When a dog is dropped or retires from our program, the handler or handler‚Äôs family is given the chance to adopt them. Most handlers, of course, choose to do so. The dogs are their partners and have become members of their family, even after just a few weeks of training together. Lulu was a adopted by her loving handler, who had the chance to work with her during imprint training. She now enjoys her days playing with his kids, sniffing out rabbits and squirrels in the backyard, and eating meals and snacks out of a dog dish. We‚Äôll miss Lulu, but this was the right decision for her. We wish her all the best in her new life. Lulu was adopted by her handler, but he still needs an explosive detection K9 partner at work.

Lulu, the agency wrote early in the thread, ‚Äúbegan to show signs that she wasn‚Äôt interested in detecting explosive odors.‚Äù The CIA tried to motivate her with food and playtime but Lulu, presumably a longtime defender of human rights abroad, was skeptical about working for an agency with a long history of election intrusion, warrantless surveillance and assassinations. Like all of us, she wanted treats, but at what cost?

Most people have no idea that the CIA has its own K9 Corps; however, our K9 officers serve as the first line of defense against explosive threats to Agency personnel and buildings at Headquarters and abroad. Additionally, they are on-call 24/7 to assist local law enforcement and other federal government agencies search for explosives. Pending graduation, these new puppies will join CIA‚Äôs K9 Corp and play a large part in keeping everyone at the CIA safe.

She‚Äôs surprisingly strong for her small size and has pulled more than one of the trainers off their feet. Full of energy, Indigo likes to work and loves to eat even more. Indigo is from Susquehanna Service Dogs. Suni is a 2-year-old black lab who is littermates with Heide from Susquehanna Service Dogs‚Äô ‚Äúastronaut litter.‚Äù All the puppies in the litter were named after famous astronauts. Suni is named after NASA astronaut Sunita ‚ÄúSuni‚Äù Williams, who holds the record for cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut. Suni is a happy, bubbly, light on her feet pup who is a little too smart for her own good. A problem-solver, Suni is poised to try to outwit the trainers at every turn. Heide, a sweet 2-year-old yellow lab, is littermates with Suni from Susquehanna Service Dogs‚Äô ‚Äúastronaut litter.‚Äù All the puppies in the litter were named after famous astronauts. Heide is named after NASA astronaut Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn-Piper, a veteran of two space flights. Heide loves to jump up on cars, tables, and anything else taller than herself. Playful and silly, she‚Äôs calmer than many of the other labs, and when she sees something unfamiliar to her, she‚Äôs prone to give a little bark. Heide is being trained for Frederick County Fire Marshal in Virginia. Freya, the oldest in the class, is a yellow lab from Susquehanna Service Dogs. She's a little over 2 years old. Freya is related to another dog in the CIA K9 unit named Nancy. Freya has an incredible drive and energy, and she stole the hearts of everyone at Susquehanna. Her puppy raiser was actually in law enforcement, so she‚Äôs had some familiarity with the life of a police K9. Lulu, the smallest dog in the class, is a 1¬Ω-year-old female black lab from Susquehanna Service Dogs. She‚Äôs hyper and silly when she plays, but has an easygoing sweetness and is extremely sensitive to her surroundings and what is being asked of her. Lulu is being trained for Fairfax County Police Department in Virginia. Nicole is a 2 year old, reddish-gold colored female yellow lab from Puppies Behind Bars. She was raised in a women‚Äôs prison in New Jersey. A very friendly, happy dog, Nicole is attentive to what is asked of her, often cocking her head to the side whenever she‚Äôs focused on something or someone. She‚Äôs a little more sensitive and tentative than the other labs, but like Heide, Nicole loves to show off her athletic ability by jumping into the air on all fours. Focused and independent, Nicole has a ton of personality and charm. PUPDATE- Meet Harry!

If my child ever needed something and I felt it was a reasonable request, I would buy it for him.

Besides, if I refuse to buy her something that I think is bad for her, she may buy it with her pocket money _ In this way, I would lose control over my child's requests. I feel it also encourages children to care more about money than anything else. I don't want my child to start judging other children by the amount of money or pocket money they have. Rakesh Shah: Yes, I would give my child pocket money because I feel that children should learn to spend money properly. I will give him a fixed amount every month and if he spends the money before the month is over, he will learn a lesson and not spend money so freely. He will learn what his limitations are and feel the difficulty when he has to pay for something that is over his own pocket. Rajiv Patel: Yes, I would give my child pocket money because it is important that he learns to manage money. But I would not give it to him on a weekly or monthly basis. He would have to earn it. If he helped me finish some of my jobs or helped his mother with housework, I would reward him. This helps him realize that \\"money does not grow on trees\\" and it requires hard work to earn money.

I was a farm boy from County Kilkenny, a child who some thought would never walk, let alone go as far as I had in the world. From the day I was born, there was a problem. The doctors at the Dublin hospital told my parents I had phocomelia, a _ that affected both legs below the knee, which were outward and shorter than normal and each foot had just three toes. Life was tough. I couldn't stand, much less walk. I rarely, left the farmhouse---and then only in someone's arms. Mam bundled me up whenever she took me to town, no matter the season. \\"The world will see him when he can walk,\\" she told Dad. \\"And he will walk.\\" Mam devoted herself to helping me. She tried everything to get me on my feet. When I was three, she and Dad took me to a clinic in Dublin. A few weeks later we returned to Dublin with my artificial limbs . Back home I practiced walking with my new limbs. \\"There's nothing anyone can do but you can't,\\" Mam said. \\"You and I are going to walk through town.\\" The next day Mam dressed me in my finest clothes. She wore a summer dress and fixed her hair and makeup. Dad drove us to the church. We stepped out of the car. Mam took my hand. \\"Hold your head up high, now, Ronan,\\" she said. We walked 300 meters to the post office. It was the farthest I'd walked, and I was sweating from the effort. Then we left the post office and continued down the street, Mam's eyes shining with a mother's pride. That night, back on our farm, I lay exhausted on my bed. It meant nothing, though, compared to what I'd done on my walk. Then I began to pursue my dream of singing. And at every step Mam's words came back to me--Ronan, you can do anything anyone else can do--and the faith she had in God, who would help me do it. I've sung from the grandest stages in Europe, to music played by the world's finest musicians. That night, I stood at the Madison Square Garden, with Mam's words chiming in my ears.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. ‚ÄúIt is the key to self improvement!‚Äù, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don‚Äôt quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here‚Äôs the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let‚Äôs face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don‚Äôt share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: ‚ÄúI might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better‚Äù. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

Math Problem Solve -61*s + 60*s = -295*s - 1470 for s.","completion":"To solve the equation -61*s + 60*s = -295*s - 1470 for s, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation, we have -61*s and 60*s, which are like terms because both are multiples of the variable s. We can combine them to simplify the expression: -61*s + 60*s = -1*s Now, the equation becomes: -1*s = -295*s - 1470 Step 2: Add 295*s to both sides of the equation to isolate the variable term s on one side. To accomplish this, add 295*s to both sides of the equation: -1*s + 295*s = -295*s + 295*s - 1470 This simplifies to: 294*s = -1470 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 294 to solve for s. Now, to find the value of s, we need to isolate the variable by dividing both sides of the equation by 294: (294*s) / 294 = -1470 / 294 This simplifies to: s = -5 So, the solution to the equation -61*s + 60*s = -295*s - 1470 is s = -5."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Bouvier was wounded in shelling Wednesday in Homs. (AP Photo)... (Associated Press) The opposition stronghold was being destroyed \\"inch by inch,\\" by government forces, with collapsed walls and scorched buildings, according to accounts Thursday, while Western and Arab leaders hoped to silence the guns long enough to rush in relief aid. The pressure for \\"humanitarian corridors\\" into the central Syrian city of Homs and other places caught in President Bashar Assad's crushing attacks appeared to be part of shifts toward more aggressive steps against his regime after nearly a year of bloodshed and thousands of deaths in an anti-government uprising. In back-to-back announcements, U.N.-appointed investigators in Geneva said a list for possible crimes against humanity prosecution reaches as high as Assad, and international envoys in London _ including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton _ made final touches to an expected demand for Assad to call a cease-fire within days to permit emergency shipments of food and medicine. Washington and European allies remain publicly opposed to direct military intervention. But there have been growing signs that Western leaders could back efforts to open channels for supplies and weapons to the Syrian opposition, which includes breakaway soldiers from Assad's military. In a sign of the international divide, however, key Assad ally Russia said Moscow and Beijing remain opposed to any foreign interference in Syria. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev spoke by telephone with the president of the United Arab Emirates and emphasized that \\"foreign interference, attempts to assess the legitimacy of the leadership of a state from the outside, run counter to the norms of international law and are fraught with the threat of regional and global destabilization,\\" the Kremlin said. \\"It is a deeply frustrating situation,\\" British Foreign Secretary William Hague told BBC radio ahead of the London talks. He said that the Assad regime \\"has continued to act seemingly with impunity.\\" At least 16 people were killed across Syria, activists said. One group, the Local Coordination Committees, put the number at 40 with attacks ranging from mountain villages to areas near the capital of Damascus. The reason for the differing tolls was not immediately clear. The most intense offensive, however, remained on beleaguered Homs, Syria's third-largest city. Its defiance _ amid hundreds of civilian casualties in the past weeks _ has eroded Assad's narrative that the uprising is the work of \\"armed thugs\\" and foreign plots. Images posted online and accounts from activists and correspondents smuggled in _ including two Western journalists killed Wednesday _ also have stirred comparisons to sieges such as Misrata during last year's Arab Spring revolt in Libya. The epicenter _ the Baba Amr neighborhood on the city's southeast corner _ is a collection of slum-like apartment blocks with peeling paint and neglected older homes. They draw in workers and fortune-seekers from across Syria to a place known as the \\"mother of the poor\\" because of its cheaper cost of living, compared with Damascus or Aleppo. \\"They are blanketing Baba Amr with shells and snipers. They are destroying it street by street, inch by inch,\\" local activist Omar Shaker told The Associated Press. Residents say 70 percent of the area is now uninhabitable in harsh winter weather with temperatures dipping close to freezing some nights. Walls have collapsed; windows are shattered from shells that fall as much as two-a-minute during some of the heaviest barrages. Another Homs activist, Mulham al-Jundi, called the conditions \\"catastrophic\\" in parts of the city, spreading over a valley in central Syria just 18 miles (30 kilometers) from the Lebanese border. Long lines form at even rumors of bread, cans of food or fuel for heaters, he said. \\"There simply isn't enough to go around anymore,\\" said Rami Abdul-Rahman, director of the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Syria's state-run media pushed back with its own version: Running photos on the official news agency SANA that claim to show markets full of food in Homs. It called the claims about food shortages \\"fabricating lies.\\" Activists give a very different view. Bodies are buried wherever people can find space, they say. The wounded are too scared to try to reach government-controlled hospitals in other parts of the city. Instead, they stagger into makeshift clinics in kitchens and offices, al-Jundi said. He said clothing thread is now used after surgical sutures ran out. In some places, medics conduct operations by only the light of an office lamp. In the Bab Drieb neighborhood, volunteers get a crash course in basic first aid before being put to work. \\"I saw a nurse teaching a couple of people what to do. They had no idea,\\" said al-Jundi. \\"It's unbelievable and tragic.\\" Homs _ which is mostly Sunni _ was an early flashpoint of dissent against Assad's regime, which is led by the minority Alawite community, which has Shiite power Iran as its main patron. In April, protesters gathered at the central Clock Square in Homs, bringing mattresses, food and water in hopes of emulating Cairo's Tahrir Square during the Egyptian revolution. Homs had a reputation for tolerance between Syria's religions and Muslim sects, said Mohammad Saleh, an opposition figure who fled the city, but Sunnis have increasingly felt pushed into an underclass status by Assad. A Western intelligence official said the Syrian military has the ability to \\"level Homs if it wanted to.\\" But the risks of backlash from Syria's majority Sunnis _ including many military officers _ is far too great, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity under briefing rules. On Wednesday, shelling of Baba Amr killed American-born veteran war correspondent Marie Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik. They were among a group of journalists who had crossed into Syria illegally and were sharing accommodations with activists, raising speculation that government forces targeted the makeshift media center where they were staying. But opposition groups had previously described the shelling as indiscriminate. At least two other Western journalists were wounded on Wednesday. A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman offered condolences to the families of Colvin and Ochlik, but rejected any responsibility for their deaths. The spokesman urged foreign journalists to respect Syrian laws and not to sneak into the country. Some Syrians held protests and vigils Wednesday night to honor Colvin and Ochlik. \\"Remi Ochlik, Marie Colvin, we will not forget you,\\" read one banner held by protesters in the town of Qsour in Homs province. Two other journalists were wounded. In a video posted on YouTube, one of those injured, Edith Bouvier of Le Figaro, said her leg is broken in two places and that she has received some medical treatment but now needs an operation. Bouvier said she was speaking Thursday and is calm throughout the more than six-minute video. The U.N. estimates that 5,400 people have been killed in repression by the Assad regime against a popular uprising that began 11 months ago. That figure was given in January and has not been updated. Syrian activists put the death toll at more than 7,300. Overall figures cannot be independently confirmed because Syria keeps tight control on the media. \\"Every minute counts,\\" Shaker said. \\"People will soon start to collapse from lack of sleep and shortages in food.\\" The international struggle over how to end Syria's crisis moves Friday to Tunisia. The meeting is expected to bring together more than 70 nations to look at ways to assist Assad's opponents. On the eve of the Tunisia meeting, the U.N. announced that former secretary-general Kofi Annan would be the joint U.N.-Arab League envoy to Syria. His mandate will be to try to end the violence and arrange a political transition. The United States, Europe and Arab nations worked in London to draft a demand for Assad to impose a cease-fire with 72 hours to allow humanitarian convoys or face new punitive measures, likely to include toughened sanctions. Officials at the London meeting said some nations have proposed creating protected corridors for humanitarian relief. It was unclear, however, whether it would receive full backing because it would almost certainly require military protection. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the ongoing discussions before the so-called \\"Friends of Syria\\" conference in Tunis. Some Arab nations, such as Qatar, have urged consideration of direct military intervention similar to the NATO-led air campaign that helped end Moammar Gadhafi's regime in Libya. Western powers have so far opposed trying to mobilize another military coalition for Syria. More workable, officials said, would be a cease-fire such as the one proposed by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is calling for a daily two-hour break in fighting to provide aid. \\"The efforts that we are undertaking with the international community ... are intended to demonstrate the Assad regime's deepening isolation,\\" Clinton told reporters. \\"Our immediate focus is on increasing the pressure. We have got to find ways of getting food, medicine and other humanitarian assistance. Into affected areas. This takes time and it takes a lot of diplomacy.\\" If Assad doesn't comply, \\"we think that the pressure will continue to build. ... I think that the strategy followed by the Syrians and their allies is one that can't stand the test of legitimacy ... for any length of time,\\" she said. \\"There will be increasingly capable opposition forces. They will from somewhere, somehow find the means to defend themselves as well as begin offensive measures.\\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said the Obama administration still opposes military intervention but \\"obviously we'll have to evaluate this as time goes on.\\" In Geneva, a panel of U.N. human rights experts said the United Nations has a secret list of top Syrian officials who could face investigation for crimes against humanity. The U.N. experts indicated that the list goes as high as Assad. Experts said the list appears mostly part of international pressures on Syria rather than a direct threat. Syria isn't a member of the International Criminal Court so is outside its jurisdiction. Russia also would likely block any moves in the U.N. Security Council to refer the country to the Hague-based tribunal. The European Union is expected next week to add seven Syrian government ministers to those already under sanctions that free assets and ban visas, said an EU official in Brussels. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of EU rules, said additional restrictions may be imposed on Syria's central bank, on imports of precious metals from the country, and on cargo flights. The EU had already sanctioned more than 70 Syrians and 19 organizations, and has banned imports of Syrian oil. In Amman, Jordan, several dozen Syrians, mainly from Homs, protested at the U.S. Embassy and asked for Western military intervention. \\"Almighty God, destroy Bashar,\\" they chanted. ___ Associated Press writers Dale Gavlak in Amman, Jordan, Matthew Lee and David Stringer in London, Lynn Berry in Moscow, Slobodan Lekic in Brussels and Frank Jordans in Geneva contributed to this report. ||||| Syrian security forces bombarded areas of Homs, a city in central Syria, for a 20th successive day on Thursday, despite a growing outcry.

Photo The Local Coordination Committees, an opposition group, said that more than two dozen people had also been killed in the city of Hama, but did not elaborate on the circumstances of the deaths. Reuters, citing activists in Hama, said that government security forces had lined up and fatally shot 13 men and boys from one extended family in the village of Kfartoun in Hama Province. Neither the death tolls, nor the report of the massacre, could be independently confirmed. Activist groups reported dozens of people killed in heavy fighting in Idlib Province as well. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and several foreign ministers of European and Arab countries met in London on Thursday ahead of the international ‚ÄúFriends of Syria‚Äù meeting in Tunis. They discussed urgent efforts to provide humanitarian assistance, especially medical supplies to Homs and other battered cities. A senior State Department official traveling with Mrs. Clinton said that countries were ready to provide considerable assistance ‚Äúwithin days‚Äù through United Nations relief agencies, but that ‚Äúthe real challenge is the access issue.‚Äù In a press conference Thursday, Mrs. Clinton moved the United States a step closer to recognizing the Syrian National Council, an exile opposition group, though a formal recognition is not expected in Tunis. She also said later, discussing growing pressure on Mr. Assad: ‚ÄúThere will be increasingly capable opposition forces. They will ‚Äî from somewhere, somehow ‚Äî find the means to defend themselves as well as begin offensive measures. And the pressure will build on countries like Russia and China because world opinion is not going to stand idly by.‚Äù Both countries recently vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution supporting a plan to end the bloodshed. Russia has said it will not attend the Tunisia meeting and news reports on Thursday said China had not committed, blunting the gathering‚Äôs chances of securing strong action against Mr. Assad‚Äôs government.

The United Nations report released Thursday argued that Syria was now ‚Äúon the brink‚Äù of civil war and said ‚Äúthe continuation of the crisis carries the risk of radicalizing the population, deepening inter-communal tensions and eroding the fabric of society.‚Äù Advertisement Continue reading the main story ‚ÄúThe commission received credible and consistent evidence,‚Äù the investigators said, ‚Äúidentifying high- and mid-ranking members of the armed forces who ordered their subordinates to shoot at unarmed protesters, kill soldiers who refused to obey such orders, arrest persons without cause, mistreat detained persons and attack civilian neighborhoods with indiscriminate tanks and machine-gun fire.‚Äù The investigators said the report was based on 369 interviews with victims, witnesses, defectors, other people with ‚Äúinside knowledge‚Äù of the situation in Syria and some government supporters. They also examined photographs, video recordings and satellite imagery to corroborate some witness accounts of the unrelenting crackdown on those who have been protesting Mr. Assad‚Äôs leadership for months. Video The investigators said they had not been allowed to enter Syria to conduct inquiries, but did many interviews by phone and spoke in person with people who had fled the country. There was no immediate response by the Syrian authorities. Accusations of human rights abuses made last November were rejected as false by the Syrian diplomatic mission in Geneva in a statement on Jan. 23 that said ‚Äúarmed terrorist groups,‚Äù not government forces, were responsible. Among the scores of people who activist groups reported were killed by rockets and bombs through the day on Wednesday in Homs were Western journalists, the veteran American war correspondent Marie Colvin, who had been working for The Sunday Times of London, and a young French photographer, R√©mi Ochlik. The two had been working in a makeshift media center that was destroyed in the assault. Activists said that the center had been targeted and that Syrian reconnaissance aircraft had probably spotted satellite transmitters on the roof of the building where it was located. The government denied targeting journalists. The killings provoked outrage, with powerful media figures and European politicians calling on Syrian forces to permit the retrieval of the bodies. At least two other journalists were wounded on Wednesday, and their newspapers in London and Paris said they were trying to find ways to rescue them. Video One of the wounded journalists, Edith Bouvier, 31, is a freelancer for the newspaper Le Figaro. Videos on YouTube showed her and Paul Conroy, a photographer who lives in Britain, appealing for help. One of the videos also shows a Syrian man in medical scrubs and a stethoscope who seconded Ms. Bouvier‚Äôs call for immediate evacuation and said her life was in danger. ‚ÄúWe need help to stop the bombardments and save Edith,‚Äù the man said in Arabic. Advertisement Continue reading the main story According to Syria‚Äôs official SANA news agency, the Foreign Ministry in Damascus on Thursday rejected ‚Äúall statements that hold Syria accountable for the death of journalists who infiltrated Syria at their own risk without the Syrian authorities‚Äô knowledge of their entry and whereabouts.‚Äù Activists, civilian journalists and foreign correspondents who have sneaked into Syria have infuriated the authorities and foiled the government‚Äôs efforts to control the coverage of clashes. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France called the journalists‚Äô killings ‚Äúmurder,‚Äù and France‚Äôs foreign minister, Alain Jupp√©, said France had asked Syria to organize the rapid evacuation of Ms. Bouvier and other foreign reporters. ‚ÄúI vigorously protest the situation of journalists in Homs,‚Äù Mr. Jupp√© said, according to Agence France-Presse. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening in Syria is more revolting, more shameful and scandalous every day.‚Äù |||||Summary:","completion":"Sieges in Homs, Syria by President Bashar Assad's government forces have left residents searching for dwindling supplies of food and medical aid. The opposition has claimed that the strongholds are being destroyed inch by inch, forcing Western and Arab leaders to consider more aggressive actions against the regime. Although publicly opposed to direct military intervention, there has been increasing pressure from Western leaders to open channels for supplies and weapons to reach the Syrian opposition. Russia and China, both key allies to Syria, have continued to oppose any foreign interference in the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who succeeded in 1873 with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle's tragedy Les √ârinnyes and with the dramatic oratorio, Marie-Magdeleine? Massenet returned to Paris in 1866. He made a living by teaching the piano and publishing songs, piano pieces and orchestral suites, all in the popular style of the day. Prix de Rome winners were sometimes invited by the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris to compose a work for performance there. At Thomas's instigation, Massenet was commissioned to write a one-act op√©ra comique, La grand'tante, presented in April 1867. At around the same time he composed a Requiem, which has not survived. In 1868 he met Georges Hartmann, who became his publisher and was his mentor for twenty-five years; Hartmann's journalistic contacts did much to promote his prot√©g√©'s reputation.In October 1866 Massenet and Ninon were married; their only child, Juliette, was born in 1868. Massenet's musical career was briefly interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71, during which he served as a volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so \\"utterly terrible\\" that he refused to write about it in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the Siege of Paris but managed to get out before the horrors of the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.After order was restored, Massenet returned to Paris where he completed his first large-scale stage work, an op√©ra comique in four acts, Don C√©sar de Bazan (Paris, 1872). It was a failure, but in 1873 he succeeded with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle's tragedy Les √ârinnyes and with the dramatic oratorio, Marie-Magdeleine, both of which were performed at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on. His reputation as a composer was growing, but at this stage he earned most of his income from teaching, giving lessons for six hours a day. Answer:","completion":"The name of the person who succeeded in 1873 with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle's tragedy Les √ârinnyes and with the dramatic oratorio, Marie-Magdeleine is Massenet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\". - CBS (an initialism of the network's former name, the Columbia Broadcasting System) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is a flagship property of CBS Corporation. The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City (at the CBS Broadcast Center) and Los Angeles (at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center). - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism. - Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. \\"Traditional folk music\\" has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - Columbia Records (also known simply as Columbia) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, Inc., the United States division of Sony Corporation. It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records. - The American folk-music revival was a phenomenon in the United States that began during the 1940s and peaked in popularity in the mid-1960s. Its roots went earlier, and performers like Josh White, Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Big Bill Broonzy, Richard Dyer-Bennet, Oscar Brand, Jean Ritchie, John Jacob Niles, Susan Reed, Paul Robeson and Cisco Houston had enjoyed a limited general popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. The revival brought forward styles of American folk music that had, in earlier times, contributed to the development of country and western, jazz, and rock and roll music. - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services. These make Sony one of the most comprehensive entertainment companies in the world. Sony's principal business operations include Sony Corporation, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Mobile (formerly Sony Ericsson) and Sony Financial. Sony is among the Semiconductor sales leaders by year and as of 2013, the fourth-largest television manufacturer in the world, after Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and TCL. - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts such as songwriter but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. - \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\" is a song written by Bob Dylan in the summer of 1962. It was first recorded in Columbia Records' Studio A on December 6, 1962 for his second album \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\". The lyrical structure is based on the question and answer form of traditional ballads such as Lord Randall. Dylan has stated that all of the lyrics were taken from the initial lines of songs that \\"he thought he would never have time to write.\\" - Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American songwriter, singer, artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when his songs chronicled social unrest. Early songs such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. - Highway 61 Revisited is the sixth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. It was released on August 30, 1965, by Columbia Records. Having until then recorded mostly acoustic music, Dylan used rock musicians as his backing band on every track of the album, except for the closing 11-minute ballad, \\"Desolation Row\\". Critics have focused on the innovative way in which Dylan combined driving, blues-based music with the subtlety of poetry to create songs that captured the political and cultural chaos of contemporary America. Author Michael Gray has argued that in an important sense the 1960s \\"started\\" with this album. - Rolling Stone is an American biweekly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. In recent years, it has resumed its traditional mix of content. - A protest song is a song that is associated with a movement for social change and hence part of the broader category of \\"topical\\" songs (or songs connected to current events). It may be folk, classical, or commercial in genre. - RCA Records is an American major record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME). It is one of SME's flagship record labels alongside sister labels Columbia Records and Epic Records. The label has released multiple genres of music, including pop, rock, hip hop, R&B, blues, jazz, and country. The company's name is derived from the initials of the label's former parent company, Radio Corporation of America (RCA). It is the second oldest recording company in U.S. history, after sister label Columbia Records. RCA's Canadian unit (formerly Berliner Gramophone Canada) is Sony's oldest label in Canada. It was one of only two Canadian record companies to survive the Great Depression. - \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" is a song written by Bob Dylan in 1962 and released as a single and on his album \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" in 1963. Although it has been described as a protest song, it poses a series of rhetorical questions about peace, war and freedom. The refrain \\"The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind\\" has been described as \\"impenetrably ambiguous: either the answer is so obvious it is right in your face, or the answer is as intangible as the wind\\". - A subsidiary, subsidiary company or daughter company is a company that is owned or controlled by another company, which is called the \\"parent company\\", \\"parent\\", or \\"holding company\\". The subsidiary can be a company, corporation, or limited liability company. In some cases it is a government or state-owned enterprise. - \`\` Gates of Eden '' is a song by Bob Dylan that appears on his fifth studio album Bringing It All Back Home , released on March 22 , 1965 by Columbia Records . It was also released as a single as the B - side of \`\` Like a Rolling Stone '' . Dylan plays the song solo , accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica . It is one of his more surreal songs . In a 2005 Mojo magazine poll of its writers and various well - known musicians , \`\` Gates of Eden '' was ranked 69th among Dylan 's 100 greatest songs . - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - EMI (officially EMI Group Limited, originally an initialism for Electric and Musical Industries and often known as EMI Records and EMI Music) was a British multinational conglomerate founded in March 1931 and was based in London. At the time of its break-up in 2012, it was the fourth-largest business group and family of record labels in the recording industry and was one of the big four record companies (now the big three). Its EMI Records Ltd. group of record labels included EMI Records, Parlophone, Virgin Records and Capitol Records. EMI also had a major publishing arm, EMI Music Publishingalso based in London with offices globally. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - American folk music is a musical term that encompasses numerous genres, many of which are known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and can sometimes be traced back to such places of origin as Great Britain, Europe, or Africa. Mike Seeger once famously commented that the definition of American folk music is \\"All the music that fits between the cracks.\\" - Epic Records is an American record company. A division of Sony Music Entertainment, Inc., Epic was founded predominantly as a jazz and classical music label in 1953. It later expanded its scope to include diverse musical genres including pop, R&B, rock and hip hop. Historically, the label has housed popular acts such as Boston, Celine Dion, Dave Clark Five, Gloria Estefan, Pearl Jam, Shakira, and Sly & the Family Stone. - Bringing It All Back Home is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on March 22, 1965 by Columbia Records. The album is divided into an electric and an acoustic side, although the acoustic side included some tracks in which other instruments were backing up Dylan and his guitar, but no drums were used. On side one of the original LP, Dylan is backed by an electric rock and roll banda move that further alienated him from some of his former peers in the folk music community. Likewise, on the acoustic second side of the album, he distanced himself from the protest songs with which he had become closely identified (such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\"), as his lyrics continued their trend towards the abstract and personal. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Solve this math problem Solve 25*a - 340 = 11*a - 29*a - 1931 for a.","completion":"Let's solve the given equation 25*a - 340 = 11*a - 29*a - 1931 for the variable 'a'. Before we get to simplifying the equation, let's first combine the like terms on both left and right-hand sides. The left side of the equation is simple enough, it is still 25a - 340. For the right-hand side, we see 11a and -29a, which are like terms (meaning they contain the same variable 'a'). By combining these like terms, we get: 11a - 29a = -18a. Hence, we can rewrite the equation as: 25a - 340 = -18a - 1931 Next, we want to gather terms with 'a' on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side to facilitate further simplification. We will add 18a to both sides of the equation to move -18a from the right to the left. We have: 25a + 18a = - 1931+ 340 This simplifies to: 43a = -1591 Finally, to solve for 'a', we can divide both sides of the equation by 43: a = -1591 / 43 Hence, the solution to the equation is: a = -37. So, for the given equation 25*a - 340 = 11*a - 29*a - 1931, the value of 'a' that satisfies the equation is -37."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Wind and water erode rocks - The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks - Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice - Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times - The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time - The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment - The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight - Question: suppose the climate changes happens, how will it affect MORE sedimentary rock forming. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"Climate change can have a significant impact on the formation of sedimentary rocks, depending on the specific changes that take place. The effects can be more, less, or even no influence, depending on the nature of the climate change. Here's how different climate change scenarios can affect sedimentary rock formation: 1. More effect: If climate change causes an increase in precipitation and/or more extreme weather events such as storms and hurricanes, there will likely be more erosion of rocks due to the enhanced wind and water activity. This would result in an increased amount of sediment being picked up and transported by wind, water, air, or ice. Consequently, more sediment would be deposited in areas, leading to a higher rate of sedimentary rock formation as the sediment layers are compressed under the weight of new deposits. 2. Less effect: Conversely, if climate change results in a decrease in precipitation, reduced water and wind erosion would lead to less sediment being generated and transported. In areas where ice plays a significant role in transporting sediment, climate change may also cause the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, resulting in a decrease in sediment carrying capacity. Ultimately, this would lead to a reduced rate of sedimentary rock formation due to less sediment deposition and compression. 3. No effect: In some cases, climate change may not have a significant impact on sedimentary rock formation. This could occur in regions where the changes in temperature and precipitation do not drastically alter the erosion rates or the transportation and deposition of sediment. In these cases, the formation of sedimentary rocks would continue at a similar pace, regardless of climate change. In summary, the impact of climate change on sedimentary rock formation can be more, less, or no effect depending on the specific changes to precipitation, temperature, or other aspects of the climate. Changes in precipitation patterns and the intensity of erosive forces like wind and water tend to have the most significant influence on the formation of sedimentary rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was honored in 1884 and awarded with a lifetime pension?, using the article: Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (English: chy-KOF-skee; Russian: –ü—ë—Ç—Ä –ò–ª—å–∏ÃÅ—á –ß–∞–π–∫–æÃÅ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π, tr.

He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style‚Äîa task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity‚Äîan ambiguity..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer is Tchaikovsky.

They come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, each with their unique nutritional profile. Beans are a great source of protein, fiber, and essential micronutrients, making them an ideal staple in numerous culinary dishes. They can be bought dried, canned, or flavored and offer a versatile range of tastes and textures. This article offers valuable tips on how to properly prepare and enjoy beans, specifically highlighting the differences between plain and flavored beans, as well as providing suggestions on how to incorporate them into a variety of dishes. Plain Versus Flavored Beans: What to Look out for It is essential to know whether the beans you are using are plain or flavored, as this will impact the way you prepare and cook them. Plain beans refer to beans that are not seasoned and come either dried or canned. Flavored beans, on the other hand, are typically canned and have added ingredients such as sauces, spices, or seasonings. These additives can greatly influence the taste and texture of your dish, so understanding the difference is crucial. Rinsing Plain Beans: A Key Step in Preparation For plain beans, it is essential to rinse them properly before cooking. If you are using canned beans, rinsing them will help remove any excess sodium content, which can be detrimental to your health if consumed in large amounts. Moreover, rinsing canned beans will also get rid of any potential metallic taste they might have. In the case of dried beans, rinsing them is necessary to eliminate potential contaminants like dirt and small stones, as well as to remove any loose skins on the beans. Heating the Beans: Saucepan or Microwave Once you've rinsed your plain beans, you can warm them up using either a saucepan or a microwave. If you prefer using a saucepan, simply pour the beans into it, add a small amount of water, and cook over low heat, bringing the water to a gentle simmer. Stir occasionally to prevent the beans from sticking to the bottom of the pan, and cook them until they are warmed through. If you choose to microwave the beans, place them in a microwave-safe bowl and cover them with a microwave-safe plate or lid. Cook the beans on high for 1-2 minutes, ensuring that you stop and stir them halfway through to promote even heating. Incorporating Plain Beans into Other Recipes Plain beans can be an extraordinary addition to a wide variety of dishes, providing a nutritional boost as well as enhancing the meal‚Äôs flavor profile. Here are a few examples of how you can incorporate plain beans into your cooking: 1. Soups and Stews: Beans blend seamlessly into soups and stews, adding richness and body to the dish. They can be an excellent complement to vegetable, chicken, or meat-based recipes. 2. Salads: Beans are a popular ingredient in salads, as they provide a refreshing contrast in texture. Combine them with leafy greens, fresh vegetables, and your choice of protein, then toss everything with your favorite salad dressing. 3. Tacos, Burritos, and Enchiladas: Beans are a staple in Mexican cuisine and can be used as a filling for tacos, burritos, enchiladas, or quesadillas. They pair well with a variety of proteins, including chicken, beef, or pork. 4. Bean Burgers: For those looking to go meatless, beans can be mashed and combined with breadcrumbs, eggs, and your choice of spices to form delicious, protein-packed veggie burgers. 5. Pasta Dishes: Beans can be incorporated into pasta dishes to add an extra layer of flavor and texture. Try tossing them with pasta, tomato sauce, vegetables, and your choice of protein. Conclusion Making the most out of beans starts with understanding whether they are plain or flavored, and preparing them accordingly. By rinsing, heating, and incorporating them into various dishes, you can enhance the nutritional value and taste of your meals. With their versatility, affordability, and health benefits, it is no wonder beans have stood the test of time in kitchens around the world."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The Cuban iguana is a species of lizard of the iguana family. It is the largest of the West Indian rock iguanas, one of the most endangered groups of lizards. This species with red eyes and a thick tail is one of the largest lizards in the Caribbean. The Cuban iguana is mainly _ : 95% of its diet consists of the leaves, flowers and fruits from as many as 30 plant species, including the seaside rock bush and various grasses. However, Cuban iguanas occasionally eat animal matter, and individuals have been watched eating the dead flesh of birds, fish and crabs. The researchers wrote that quite a few people on Isla Magueyes could have caused this incident. The Cuban iguana is living throughout the rocky southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islands with a wild population growing rapidly on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico. It is also found on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, where a separate subspecies occurs. Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites half destroyed by Cuban crocodiles. To avoid the attack from them, the Cuban iguana often makes its home within or near prickly-pear cacti . In general the species is decreasing, more quickly on the mainland than on the outlying islands. One of the reasons for their decrease is habitat destruction caused by the over consuming of farm animals, housing development, and the building of tourist resorts on the beaches where the animals prefer to build their nests. Although the wild population is decreasing, the numbers of iguanas have been sharply increased as a result of captive-breeding and other protection programs. Options: A To give us a brief introduction to the Cuban iguana. B To show he is concerned about the Cuban iguana. C To explain reasons for the Cuban iguana's decrease.

Good pictures, interesting hobbies, and a witty bio - everyone seems to have a formula for success. However, LA-based writer Alli Reed recently came up with a fascinating twist on what constitutes an attractive online presence. Reed conducted an unconventional experiment to test whether the 'worst fake dating profile in history' would deter men from interacting with the profile's owner. Surprisingly, her hypothesis was proven incorrect. In just 24 hours, the purposely detestable profile managed to receive more than 150 messages. Reed set out to prove that \\"there exists an online dating profile so loathsome that no man would message it,\\" but her outcome was altogether different. When creating the fake OKCupid profile, Reed utilized a picture of her best friend, who happens to be a stunning model. She deliberately constructed a bio devoid of any appealing characteristics to gauge whether a captivating photo would be enough to maintain interest from potential suitors ‚Äì and it did!

Information: - Edward Teach or Edward Thatch ( 22 November 1718), better known as Blackbeard, was a notorious English pirate who operated around the West Indies and the eastern coast of Britain's North American colonies. Although little is known about his early life, he was probably born in Bristol, England. Recent genealogical research indicates his family moved to Jamaica where Edward Thatch, Jr. is listed as being a mariner in the Royal Navy aboard HMS \\"Windsor\\" in 1706. He may have been a sailor on privateer ships during Queen Anne's War before settling on the Bahamian island of New Providence, a base for Captain Benjamin Hornigold, whose crew Teach joined sometime around 1716. Hornigold placed him in command of a sloop he had captured, and the two engaged in numerous acts of piracy. Their numbers were boosted by the addition to their fleet of two more ships, one of which was commanded by Stede Bonnet, but toward the end of 1717 Hornigold retired from piracy, taking two vessels with him. - A television network is a telecommunications network for distribution of television program content, whereby a central operation provides programming to many television stations or pay television providers.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. ‚ÄúThis welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,‚Äù Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. ‚ÄúIf we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.‚Äù American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump‚Äôs proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania‚Äôs 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat.

Yahoo Keeps Mobile Focus On Content, Services Yahoo has long shied away from creating its own cellphones and mobile operating system, even as rivals like Google and Microsoft dove in. Last week, at least, that decision looked wise. On June 30 Microsoft revealed it would stop producing its line of \\"Kin\\" cellphones, launched with much fanfare just a few weeks ago. On July 1, Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said the search giant would not release any more Google-designed Nexus phones, and T-Mobile USA said it would halt distribution of its once-popular Sidekick phones. Analysts attributed all these decisions to disappointing sales in the face of fierce competition. David Ko, a Yahoo ( YHOO - news - people ) senior vice president who oversees its audience, mobile and local businesses for North and Latin America, says the company continues to believe advertising campaigns, applications and partnerships are the best way to increase its mobile business. Rather than compete with companies like Nokia ( NOK - news - people ) and Samsung, Yahoo collaborates with them, in part to gain access to their hundreds of millions of users. Even Google ( GOOG - news - people ) could be considered a mobile partner with the recent release of several Yahoo applications for Google Android phones. Forbestalked to Ko about his strategy, Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz's take on the wireless industry and why Yahoo has no plans to buy a mobile ad network. Forbes: You oversee Yahoo's mobile business as well as its audience properties. How are you tying mobile and media together? Ko: We had treated mobile as a vertical [business] across the company for a very long time, but it needs to be a true horizontal. It shouldn't be one group thinking about how to mobilize the company, but everyone. Users are no longer logging onto their PCs or laptops for content; they're getting it on netbooks, iPads and cellphones. We have Yahoo Finance and Fantasy Sports on the iPhone and BlackBerry. We're taking our core media properties and pushing them out across these platforms. On July 1 Yahoo released a slew of mobile applications, including Mail and Messenger applications for Google Android phones. What's the strategy there? We want to make it really easy for users to access our services wherever, whenever, however. We've been focused primarily on iPhone and BlackBerry, but people are searching for Yahoo on Android. I recognize we may be a little late to Android, but we wanted to have something with increased functionality, not just a \\"me too\\" app that we had on other partners one to two years ago. The Android apps let you view and download attachments, get push e-mail and toggle between Mail and Messenger, among other things. Mail and Messenger are core parts of our communications suite that can link out to other areas, and are where the bulk of our users are today. As we start to integrate more of our content, you will see more apps pop up. Now that Yahoo is on Android, what other mobile platforms are you thinking of adding? We've partnered with a number of carriers and manufacturers, and most manufacturers are tied to specific platforms. In May we signed a worldwide agreement with Nokia to be the exclusive provider of Ovi Mail and Chat services on its phones. Before that we made an announcement with Samsung to distribute our communications services and content across phones that run [Samsung's own operating system] Bada and Android. The Bada stuff is still to come, and a lot of the Nokia integration too. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Yahoo focuses on providing content and services for mobile phones, instead of making their own phones or operating systems.

To find the percentage of the item's price on day 3 relative to its sale price on day 1, we need to divide the sale price on day 3 by the sale price on day 1 and multiply by 100: (0.85*(0.9*0.95*P)) / (0.95*P) * 100 The \\"P\\" on both numerator and denominator will cancel out, which leaves us with: 0.85 * 0.9 * 100 = 76.5 Step 4: Choose the correct answer from the given options.

Another Food Trend Story: Pizza's Inexorable Rise We used a database of the frequency with which a term has appeared in the pages of The New York Times to measure how food trends have propagated across the country. But we omitted the food trend of the century in the process. Pizza is now ubiquitous, considered the consummate American food despite its Italian origins. But it wasn‚Äôt always so. It did not start receiving regular mentions in The Times until the 1950s. In that era, it was a newfangled ethnic food just starting to make inroads into the American palate. For a sense of pizza‚Äôs epic rise toward the center of the American diet, take a look at the food battle of the century, between pizza and hamburgers, as reflected in Times coverage. There were scattered references to hamburgers in The Times going back to the 1850s, and by the start of the 20th century they were mentioned at least a couple of dozen times a year before reaching a prewar peak of 206 stories mentioning the hamburger in 1939. But starting in the 1950s, pizza‚Äôs campaign to become the 20th century casual food of choice was underway. It first surpassed hamburger in Times coverage in 1976. The two bounced around in close competition for the remainder of the 1970s, but in 1982 they diverged, and pizza never looked back. By the time pizza references peaked, in 2011, the word was contained in 1,183 Times articles, nearly six times the 214 articles containing the word hamburger. (Adding cheeseburger to the mix doesn‚Äôt radically change the results; the word adds only 68 articles to hamburger‚Äôs 2011 total). If you are curious about a third competitor for the throne of Top American Casual Food, prepare to be disappointed. Hot dog has almost never been top dog. There were two brief exceptions in 1925 and 1928, when the term surpassed hamburger. But otherwise, the 20th century was an era of hamburger dominance until pizza came along. There was one bright spot for team hot dog back in 2009. The term surpassed hamburger in Times appearances for the first time since 1928. By that point, of course, both were far outranked by pizza references. Actually, both hamburgers and hot dogs have a new competitor for second place. Tacos had long lagged both in Times references, but since 2011 has narrowly edged hamburgers and hot dogs for the No. 2 spot among casual foods in Times references. (There were also a surprisingly high number of ‚Äútaco‚Äù mentions in the 19th century, but these appear to be more an artifact of the challenges of digitizing very old text than an early outbreak of coverage of Mexican street food. Kevin Drum raised this strange matter of the apparent 19th-century taco boom here.) There is a broader point to be made about America as a cultural melting pot. After all, hamburgers and hot dogs are both Americanized versions of German dishes, and they have now been supplanted by foods with origins in Italy and Mexico. But rather than consider these themes further, we are now getting hungry and have a few ideas for solving that problem. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about how pizza became very popular in America, even though it came from Italy. It talks about how people started eating pizza more and more, and newspapers like The New York Times started writing about it more often. It also compares the popularity of pizza to other favorite foods like hamburgers, hot dogs, and tacos. The article shows how different types of foods from different countries can become a big part of American culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The girl's dog was acting very interested in what was in the bushes up ahead. To both the girl and the dog's surprise, there was a small brown bear resting in the bushes.

According to the story, the young girl and her dog took a trip into the woods. As they journeyed deeper into the woods, they found it to be dark and cold. The dog was interested in something in the bushes, leading to their surprising discovery of a small brown bear resting there. However, it is worth noting that their intention for entering the woods was not specified as hunting bears. The bear itself was not surprised and was not threatened by their presence, indicating that the girl and her dog did not pose a threat to it like in a hunting situation. The smile from the bear and its subsequent return to sleep could imply its comfort around them, a concept which is unconventional in a hunting circumstance. There was also the absence of hunting tools or tactics mentioned during the narrative that might suggest the presence of a hunting scenario. Descriptions of fear and surprise were more dominant in their encounter with the bear, making it more of an unexpected interaction with wildlife, rather than a planned pursuit of game. With no explicit or implicit information pointing towards hunting bears in the story, it becomes clear that this activity was not their intention or what they were doing when they were surprised.

Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Dustin Miller (born May 2, 1977), best known by his stage name D-Loc, is an MC in the rap rock group Kottonmouth Kings and rap group Kingspade.

The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems. - , formerly known as , is a Japanese multinational electronics corporation headquartered in Kadoma, Osaka, Japan. - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What is a product of layers of sediment pushing down on decomposing algae over time?\\" with the following options: - Fungus - Greenhouse gases - Fossil fuels - Calcium carbonate - salinity - Sand - contamination - Water A:","completion":"A product of layers of sediment pushing down on decomposing algae over time is fossil fuels. To elaborate on this, the process through which fossil fuels, particularly oil, are formed involves the accumulation and preservation of organic material, such as algae, within sedimentary rock layers over millions of years. The decomposition of this organic material under great pressure and heat transforms it into hydrocarbon-rich substances like crude oil and natural gas, both of which are important fossil fuels. As stated in Fact 1, oil forms from decomposing algae subjected to the weight of sediment layers accumulated over time. This process occurs in anaerobic conditions, meaning that oxygen is not present or is present in very low amounts. Without oxygen, the decomposing algae undergoes chemical changes, producing organic-rich shale, kerogen, and eventually, oil and gas deposits through a process known as diagenesis and catagenesis. Fact 2 affirms the link between ancient biomass material and the formation of fossil fuels like coal and oil. These fuels are essentially the remains of ancient forests and marine organisms that have been subjected to various geological processes over millions of years. The energy stored within the chemical bonds of these ancient organisms becomes a valuable resource when extracted and utilized for modern-day human needs, such as transportation, electricity generation, and heating. So, when considering the two facts mentioned along with the given options, the most accurate answer to the question \\"What is a product of layers of sediment pushing down on decomposing algae over time?\\" is \\"Fossil fuels.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me start by asking the first question. Does everyone dream? W: It appears that everyone does. Mostly when people say that they never dream, what they really mean is that they don't remember their dreams or they don't think their dreams are important. The reason behind is that they might have been made fun of with a child when they first reported their dreams or it was so frightening that they just turned off dreaming completely. The other day, someone named Davis came to me and said that he used to be a great dreamer, but suddenly he stopped having dreams. I asked him what it happened. It turned out that his brother died by heart attack and he never expected that such a terrible thing would happen to a young person. Generally, when there was some frightening event and dream about it was too terrible. People prefer not to dream about it. Actually the worst thing you can do is stop dreaming. Because it means that the bad experience would be too painful to even appear in dreams. As long as you dream about it and even the dream is frightening, your mind is working on it. My personal opinion about what dreams do is that they help us deal with our problems. We see certain patterns take place in dreams. When a person is hurt deep inside, when a person is seriously ill or when a person has been really sad, if people turn off their dreams totally, it means they don't love themselves to even think about it. Question: What is Dr Garfield's opinion about dreaming? - It is very useful. - It makes things worse. - It prevents the mind from working. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Dr. Garfield's opinion about dreaming is that it is very useful. She believes that dreams help us deal with our problems and that our minds work on resolving issues through dreaming. Patterns in dreams can reveal deep-seated emotions and issues, such as serious illness or sadness. Turning off dreams entirely can be detrimental, as it means the person is not allowing themselves to process and work through their problems. Dreaming, even if the dreams are frightening, shows that the mind is actively working on these issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Food is digested mechanically and chemical through a process that includes the mouth, esophagus, small intestine and large intestine\\" correctly answer the question \\"How is food digested?\\"? Choices: a). no b). yes","completion":"b). yes The response \\"Food is digested mechanically and chemically through a process that includes the mouth, esophagus, small intestine, and large intestine\\" serves as a concise summary of the digestive process described in the paragraph. It includes both types of digestion - mechanical and chemical - and mentions the main organs involved in the process. Mechanically, food is broken down into smaller pieces through actions like chewing (in the mouth) and churning of the stomach. On the other hand, chemical digestion refers to the enzymatic process where food is broken down into its nutrient pieces that can be absorbed. This starts in the mouth (with enzymes in saliva), continues in the stomach (with gastric juices), and concludes in the small intestine. The small intestine is indeed where the majority of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption takes place, after which any remaining undigested food matter passes to the large intestine where water is absorbed, conforming again to the response given. Thus, the response is correct. Furthermore, the esophagus is also correctly included as part of the digestive process, even though its role is largely about transportation of the bolus (chewed food) from the mouth to the stomach, rather than digestion or absorption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Elasticity is just a fancy word that tells us how much something changes when another thing changes.

I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said. Question: \\"What is the discrepancy between TV Asahi and Public broadcaster NHK as to how many seats the LDP/Komei coalition has gained so far?\\" Answer: \\"Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats and NHK says Komei party, gained at least 302 seats\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Answer: The discrepancy between TV Asahi's report and Public broadcaster NHK's report is that TV Asahi states the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats in the lower house, while NHK reports that the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight? Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease.

He was to have met with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit to coincide with Victory Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II Kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments, including the leaders of China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam and Venezuela. This number represents about half the world leaders that Russia has said it invited to the celebrations. Kim's trip had been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation. There was no further explanation, from Moscow or Pyongyang, as to why he wouldn't head west. Still, North Korea has a number of issues it's been wrestling with for years. They include widespread poverty, its longstanding spat with neighboring South Korea and the United States, as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program. And news about Kim's non-visit comes a day after South Korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that Kim is ruling with an iron fist , having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year. CNN cannot independently confirm the executions detailed by Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy who attended the closed briefing. And the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear. That said, North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world. And there's little doubt that Kim is very much in charge. According to Shin, intelligence officials say the North Korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own. ||||| MOSCOW (AP) ‚Äî The leader of North Korea will not be coming to Moscow next month for the Victory Day celebration, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman announced Thursday. The highly anticipated trip would have been Kim Jong Un's first foreign trip since taking power more than three years ago.

North Korea, however, had never confirmed that Kim planned to come. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press \\"internal matters\\" were preventing Kim from leaving North Korea. He did not elaborate. On Wednesday, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers that Kim had ordered the execution of 15 senior officials this year who were accused of challenging his authority. Since taking over North Korea's leadership after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011, Kim has removed members of the old guard through a series of purges ‚Äî including the 2013 execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, for alleged treason.

Earlier residents of and visitors to the lands in and around the park before its creation included the Hohokam, Sobaipuri, Tohono O'odham, Apaches, Spanish explorers, missionaries, miners, homesteaders, and ranchers. In 1933, President Herbert Hoover, using the power of the Antiquities Act, established the original park, Saguaro National Monument, in the Rincon Mountains. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy added the Tucson Mountain District to the monument and renamed the original tract the Rincon Mountain District. Congress combined the Tucson Mountain District and the Rincon Mountain District to form the national park in 1994. Popular activities in the park include hiking on its 165 miles (266 km) of trails and sightseeing along paved roads near its two visitor centers. Both districts allow bicycling and horseback riding on selected roads and trails. The Rincon Mountain District offers limited wilderness camping, but there is no..., can you guess it ?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Ayaan Hirsi Ali (; Dutch: [a:'ja:n 'hi:rsi 'a:li] ( listen); born Ayaan Hirsi Magan, 13 November 1969) is a Somali-born Dutch-American activist, feminist, author, scholar and former politician. Context: In early 2014 Brandeis University in Massachusetts announced that Ali would be given an honorary degree at the graduation commencement ceremony. In early April, the university rescinded its offer following a review of her statements that was carried out in response to protests by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and lobbying by Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Head of the Islamic Studies Department, other faculty members and several student groups that accused Hirsi Ali of \\"hate speech\\". University president Frederick M. Lawrence said that \\"certain of her past statements\\" were inconsistent with the university's \\"core values\\" because they were \\"Islamophobic.\\" Others expressed opinions both for and against this decision. The university said she was welcome to come to the campus for a dialogue in the future. The university's withdrawal of its invitation generated controversy and condemnation among some. But, The Economist noted at the time that Hirsi Ali's \\"Wholesale condemnations of existing religions just aren't done in American politics.\\" It said that \\"The explicit consensus in America is ecumenical and strongly pro-religious...\\" The university was distinguishing between an open intellectual exchange, which could occur if Hirsi Ali came to campus for a dialogue, and appearing to celebrate her with an honorary degree. A Brandeis spokesperson said that Ali had not been invited to speak at commencement but simply to be among honorary awardees. She claimed to have been invited to speak and expressed shock at Brandeis' action. Hirsi Ali said CAIR's letter misrepresented her and her work, but that it has long been available on the Internet. She said that the \\"spirit of free expression\\" has been betrayed and stifled. David Bernstein, a law professor at George Mason University, criticised the Brandeis decision as an attack on academic values of freedom of inquiry and intellectual independence. Among the commenters, Jeffrey Herf, a Brandeis alumnus and historian, published an open letter criticizing Lawrence's decision, saying it had \\"done deep and long-lasting damage to a university.\\" Lawrence J. Haas, the former communications director and press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, published an open letter saying that Lawrence \\"succumbed to political correctness and interest group pressure in deciding that Islam is beyond the pale of legitimate inquiry... that such a decision is particularly appalling for a university president, for a campus is precisely the place to encourage free discussion even on controversial matters.\\" Question: Did she think she had a speaking arrangement? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Ayaan Hirsi Ali believed that she had a speaking arrangement at Brandeis University's graduation commencement ceremony. After the university rescinded its offer of an honorary degree to her, Hirsi Ali claimed that she had been invited to speak during the event and expressed her shock at the university's decision. She argued that her work and views had been misrepresented by CAIR in their letter and that the \\"spirit of free expression\\" had been betrayed and stifled as a result of this action. However, a Brandeis spokesperson stated that Ali had not been invited to speak at the commencement but simply to be among honorary awardees. The controversy surrounding the university's decision and the difference in understanding around the nature of the arrangement highlights the importance of open intellectual exchange and the challenge of navigating controversial figures in academic settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This response is chosen because there is a lack of crucial details that could help us determine a timeframe. Factors that could influence how long it takes to find a missing person (or in this case, a character referred to as Digger) include the resources available for the search, the area in which he could be hiding or lost, any known routines or habits of the missing person that could help predict his location, how much time has already passed since he was last seen, and whether there are any leads to follow. In the case of Digger's disappearance, while it is made clear that everyone in the trailer is invested in finding him and have even considered involving external help like Dr. Lamont, we don't know if they have enough resources or people to conduct an exhaustive search, nor do we know the potential area that needs to be searched. It's also unknown if Digger has any patterns or common places he frequents that could help in locating him, or when he was last seen. Therefore, even though everyone seems quite eager and ready to find Digger, without knowing the specifics, it's impossible to accurately predict how long the search might take, whether it would be a matter of minutes, hours, or even months.

The company's net operating loss for the quarter grew to 186.8 million from 69.5 million a year earlier because of an increase in asbestos adjustments. (Reporting By Byron Kaye; Editing by Diane Craft) Can we draw the following conclusion?

Although it's reported that the company had a net operating loss for the quarter, primarily due to an increase in asbestos adjustments, this doesn't conclusively determine its ability to afford pay raises. Here are my step-by-step thoughts: 1. Evaluate the financial condition of the company. A rise in sales of 15 percent from the previous year shows the company is making more revenue. However, the company has a growing net operating loss. 2. Consider the reason for the net operating loss. It's stated the loss is due to \\"an increase in asbestos adjustments.\\" This could be a one-off or ongoing expense, but without more context, it's difficult to assess this. 3. Reflect upon the impact on wages. The ability to afford pay raises depends on several factors, such as overall profitability, cash flows, cost-saving strategies, etc. The specifics required to make this determination are not provided here. Based on the information available, the conclusion that James Hardie Industries Plc cannot afford to give raises to its employees is not directly supported.

Please answer the following question: - The salt water is heated - As the saltwater is heated the water becomes a gas - The salt particles sink to the bottom of the container - Gaseous water is piped into another container - Allowed to cool - The salt particles are left behind in the first container What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"A: The last step of the process is likely the collection and storage of the desalinated water and the separated salt, as described below: 1. Collecting the desalinated water: After the gaseous water has been cooled down in the second container, it turns back into its liquid state, now free of salt particles. This desalinated water is collected separately from the original saltwater mixture. It can be stored in a clean and appropriate container or reservoir for its intended use, such as for drinking, agricultural needs, or industrial applications. 2. Collecting the separated salt: Meanwhile, in the first container where the salt particles have sunk to the bottom, the remaining salt residue can be collected and stored. Depending on the intended use for this salt, it may require further processing to remove any impurities and meet industry standards. The separated salt can potentially be used in various industries such as food production, agriculture, or chemical manufacturing. 3. Cleaning and maintenance: Lastly, it is essential to ensure that both containers and any additional equipment used in the process are thoroughly cleaned and maintained. This step ensures the quality and safety of the desalinated water and separated salt, as well as the longevity and efficiency of the equipment. In summary, the last step of the process involves collecting and storing the desalinated water and separated salt for their respective uses and conducting proper cleaning and maintenance of the equipment.

Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material, and almost always under appreciated. He's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero, and has the type of strong, solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him. Baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that's what's so great about him. He really seems to mean what he's saying, regardless of how clich√©, obvious or silly, which puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. It's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. This was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there's a real timeless quality that doesn't jar you away from the action on screen. To be honest, I've always enjoyed the films of Greydon Clark, who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his best. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true grit and violence.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Different societies take care of their young differently. It often boils down to economic activities. For example, take two locations, location A and location B. Location A is a large city where life is hectic. Children are usually raised here according to classical attachment. On the other hand, location B is in the countryside where people get to see each other more often. Location B is essentially an alloparenting community. and a hint : The traditional model of child psychology in relation to parents is called, ‚ÄúClassical Attachment‚Äù in which the child has a strong attachment to one figure (the mother). In alloparenting communities, attachment theory suggest that the same sort of bond is shared between the child and multiple community members.[32] This has potential advantages for the child and the parents. The child has a diversified network of caregivers which can provide intimate emotional support.[33] The parent‚Äôs cost of child rearing goes down as well as the emotional cost and cost of tangible resources.

Options are: i. yes. ii. it is not possible to tell. iii. no.","completion":"The hypothesis \\"The Chicago Bulls play baseball\\" is not true, so the correct answer is iii. no. The premise statement discusses the Chicago Bulls and the Raptors, both of which are professional sports teams, but it doesn't explicitly state the sport they play. However, based on the context, we can infer that the statement is talking about winning games and making the comparison in terms of the teams' growth. The Chicago Bulls are a well-known basketball team competing in the National Basketball Association (NBA). They are based in Chicago, Illinois, and have a rich history of success in the league, including six championships during the 1990s.

Answer choices: - Physical weathering - moonlight - sunshine - flooding - clouds - precipitation - scarce resources - erosion Answer:","completion":"Answer: If houses have disappeared because of precipitation, then houses have disappeared primarily because of flooding and erosion. Precipitation refers to the various forms of water that fall from the atmosphere, such as rain, snow, sleet, and hail. An excessive amount of precipitation can lead to flooding, which may cause damage to or even destroy houses. In areas prone to heavy rainfall and flash floods, houses can be submerged in water, causing significant structural damage or even complete collapse. Erosion is the gradual wearing away of the earth's surface by natural forces, such as water, wind, or ice. Erosion can be significantly exacerbated by heavy precipitation which can cause landslides or rapid soil movement. The loss of soil and support around a house's foundation can lead to structural instability, ultimately causing the house to collapse or disappear. Physical weathering, moonlight, sunshine, clouds, and scarce resources do not directly cause houses to disappear due to precipitation. However, physical weathering can indirectly contribute to a structure's weakening over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: A big marathon is being held in Chicago this year, Many people from the area are going to participate and there is a cash prize of 10000 for the winner. A sporting goods store that specializes in amino acid supplements begins advertising more heavily during the time coming up to the race. Given most of the marathon participants are competitive athletes, will sales at the sporting goods store increase or decrease for amino acid supplements? Answer:","completion":"It is highly likely that sales of amino acid supplements at the sporting goods store will increase in the time leading up to the marathon, given that most of the marathon participants are competitive athletes. There are several factors that contribute to this expected increase in sales. Firstly, as the marathon approaches, participating athletes will be more focused on their training and performance. Amino acid supplements are known for their potential benefits in enhancing athletic performance, recovery, and muscle growth. Competitive athletes are often seeking ways to improve and maximize their abilities, and supplements, including amino acids, are a popular option for them to consider. Secondly, the large cash prize of 10,000 for the winner of the marathon is an additional incentive for participants to invest in products that could give them a competitive edge. This incentive could lead to an increased interest in amino acid supplements, translating into higher sales for the sporting goods store. Moreover, the store's increased advertising efforts during the period leading up to the race will likely raise awareness about the availability and benefits of amino acid supplements among participants and potential customers. As a result, there will be a higher probability of people visiting the store and purchasing these supplements in preparation for the marathon. Additionally, the increased foot traffic due to marathon-related activities and the influx of participants coming to Chicago for the event can also contribute to increased sales. As people travel to the area to participate in or watch the marathon, they may be more likely to visit the sporting goods store, either for their own needs or to buy supplements as gifts for others. Furthermore, sales of other types of sporting goods and accessories may also increase due to the marathon, leading to a greater overall revenue for the store. As athletes and supporters visit the store for their amino acid supplements, they may also purchase other items, such as running shoes, gear, and other nutritional products, thus contributing to a higher overall sales volume. In conclusion, considering the factors mentioned above, it is reasonable to expect that sales of amino acid supplements at the sporting goods store will increase in the time leading up to the Chicago marathon. This is due to the heightened awareness and demand for performance-enhancing products among competitive athletes participating in the event, as well as the store's proactive advertising strategies and the potential increase in foot traffic in the area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You decide. Compared with 50 years ago, when I was just four years old, people now make nearly three times as much money, eat one third more food and expect to live one third longer. In fact, it's hard to find any areas of the world that's worse off now than it was then, even though the world population has more than doubled over that period. One reason we are richer, healthier, taller, cleverer, longer-lived and freer than ever before is that the four most basic human needs--food, clothing, fuel and shelter--have grown much cheaper. Take one example: In 1800, a candle providing one hour's light cost six hours' work. In the 1880s, the same light from a lamp took 15 minutes' work to pay for. In 1950, it was eight seconds. Today, it's half a second. In these terms, we are 43,200 times better off than in1800. In the United States, rivers, lakes, seas and air are getting cleaner all the time. A car today produces less pollution traveling at full speed than a parked car did from leaks in 1970. Although the world population is growing, the rate of increase has been falling for 50 years. Across the world, national birth rates are lower now than in 1960, and in the less developed world, the birth rate has almost halved. According to a research report from the United Nations, population will start falling once it reaches 9.2 billion in 2075.

In 1970s, there were 550 billion barrels of oil reserves in the world, and in the 20 years that followed the world used up 600 billion. So by 1990, reserves should have been overused by 50 billion barrels. Instead, it is reported there are 900 billion today.

Bicol comprises six provinces, four on the Bicol Peninsula mainland (the southeastern end of Luzon) Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, and Sorsogon and the offshore island provinces of Catanduanes and Masbate. 'beau belga' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'position played on team / speciality'? Choices: - center - end Answer:","completion":"Beau Belga, a Filipino professional basketball player, is related to the object entity \\"center\\" through the relation of \\"position played on team/specialty\\". In basketball, the center is a position that typically requires a player to be tall, have good rebounding abilities, play physically, and defend the rim. Beau Belga, who plays for Rain or Shine Elasto Painters in the Philippine Basketball Association, is known for filling this role due to his size and skills on the court. As a center, Belga generally operates close to the basket and plays a crucial role in his team's offense by scoring close-range shots and creating opportunities for teammates with his passing abilities. Moreover, his defensive abilities are essential, as he is responsible for blocking opponents' shots and securing defensive rebounds. It's important to differentiate Belga's position from the term \\"end\\" mentioned in the choices. The term \\"end\\" is not a basketball position, but can be found in the context of the theological meaning of the \\"end of the world,\\" as described in the information provided. Therefore, it is not related to Beau Belga's role on a basketball team. In conclusion, Beau Belga is associated with \\"center\\" as his position and specialty in the game of basketball, contributing both offensively and defensively on the court for his team. Being a successful and skilled player in the PBA, he has earned recognition for his contributions to the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: (i). no (ii). yes The answer is:","completion":"(i). no The two sentences don't have the same meaning. The structure and direction of the sentences are reversed. In the first sentence, \\"The Voievodeasa River is a tributary of the Sucevi≈£a River in Romania,\\" it is indicated that the Voievodeasa River is a smaller stream or river that flows into the larger Sucevi≈£a River. However, the second sentence, \\"The river Sucevi≈£a is a tributary of the Voievodeasa River in Romania,\\" suggests the exact opposite. Here, it is stating that the Sucevi≈£a River is the smaller body of water contributing its flow to the larger Voievodeasa River. In essence, the difference between the two sentences centers on which river is being described as the tributary (i.e., the smaller river that feeds into the larger one). In geography, a tributary never can be a larger river. It is always smaller than the main river (which can also be called the parent river or main stem). Hence these two sentences have distinct, and not the same meanings. To summarize: 1. In the first sentence, the Voievodeasa River is described as pouring its water into the Sucevi≈£a River. 2. In the second sentence, the Sucevi≈£a River is indicated as being the one that feeds into the Voievodeasa River.

Now that we have the words properly segmented, let's discuss the phrase in more detail. This phrase highlights a contrast between two differing lifestyles or attitudes: that of a pampered animal and a self-reliant man. A pampered animal refers to a creature, perhaps a domesticated pet like a cat or a dog, that is given constant care, attention, and luxury by its owner. Pampered animals often live in comfortable surroundings, with their needs met readily ‚Äì be it food, area to play, or grooming. They typically do not have to exert any significant effort in order to receive the things that they need or desire. Instead, they rely on their owners to provide them with everything, essentially living a life of ease and indulgence. These animals may have little to no experience with challenges or struggles, and may not know how to handle hardships if they were to arise. On the other hand, a self-reliant man is an individual who is independent, resourceful, and confident in their ability to navigate life without relying on others. This person believes in taking responsibility for their own actions and outcomes, learning from their mistakes, and growing stronger through overcoming obstacles. They are capable of making decisions, solving problems, and facing challenges on their own, without needing constant assistance or hand-holding from others. A self-reliant man is self-sufficient, adaptive, and resilient. By contrasting these two concepts, the phrase suggests that pampered animals and self-reliant men are on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to dealing with life's challenges. The underlying message implies that living a life of constant pampering and indulgence, like that of a pampered animal, is not a desirable state of existence for a person. Instead, the phrase implies that developing the traits of a self-reliant man ‚Äì independence, resourcefulness, and resilience ‚Äì is a more admirable and fulfilling way to approach one's life. In conclusion, the phrase \\"A pampered animal, not a self-reliant man!\\" highlights the notable differences between the indulgent lifestyle of a pampered animal and the resourceful, independent qualities of a self-reliant man. It underscores the importance of nurturing self-reliance and personal growth instead of becoming overly reliant on the comforts and conveniences that others provide. This message can inspire and motivate individuals to take charge of their own lives, cultivate resilience, and ultimately become more self-reliant and adaptive in the face of life's challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He had a liquid substance that he labeled as state A. He then transformed half of the liquid substance to gaseous state. He labeled it as state B. Finally, he froze the remaining half of the liquid to solid state. He labeled it as state C. But I can use this background: There are many examples in the chemical world of changes in entropy. Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid. What is an answer for this question: Which state has less possible arrangements, state A or state B? Answer:","completion":"State A has less possible arrangements than state B. This is because state A is a liquid, and in liquids, particles are confined to a specified volume and are relatively close to each other.

Most universities will give you the option of either purchasing or renting academic regalia. For most people, renting academic regalia is more cost effective. However, if you are planning on becoming a professor, you might be expected to wear regalia as a faculty member at future events. In that case, purchasing your own regalia might be more efficient. Many universities have a specific provider of academic regalia and will not permit you to purchase regalia elsewhere. Other universities will allow you to buy or rent regalia from any provider you choose, or perhaps borrow regalia from an alumna. Always adhere to your specific school's regalia requirements so that you are allowed to participate fully in commencement exercises. Different types of degrees require varying academic hoods. To make sure that you acquire the correct kind of hood, inform your provider whether you are earning an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, or Doctoral degree. An Associate's degree hood is usually worn flat against the back like a cape or cowl. Note that Associate's hoods are not as commonly worn as graduate degree hoods--you might not need a hood to be a part of your regalia. A Bachelor's degree hood is 3 feet long and does not end in a sharp point. Note that Bachelor's hoods are not as commonly worn as graduate degree hoods--you might not need a hood to be a part of your regalia. A Master's degree hood is 3.5 feet long and comes to a point at the bottom. A Doctoral hood is the longest hood at 4 feet long. It has the sharpest point and also the largest trim of all hoods. If you‚Äôre not using the university provider, it‚Äôs important to double check that your regalia adheres to school standards. Make sure that your regalia provider has all the relevant institutional information so that you match your fellow graduates. American universities have a standard set of colors that indicate your field of study, rather than just your degree. These fields determine the color of the velvet trim that lines your hood. European universities are not standardized in the same way as American universities. Check with your institution to make sure you are purchasing the correct academic hood. Law students, for example, wear hoods trimmed in purple, while all Ph.D. students wear hoods trimmed in royal blue. Summary:","completion":"This article discusses the various options for obtaining academic regalia, emphasizing the importance of adhering to university guidelines and understanding the differences in hoods for various degrees and fields of study, while considering factors such as cost, career paths, and institutional requirements in making the decision to rent or purchase regalia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But did you know that, even though it might appear like a fun game, it could mean your pet is sick? Researchers have found that if a dog runs after its tail, chases cars and barks at flies that are not there, it may have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, ). In fact, OCD is even more common among humans. The symptoms are varied: some people check and recheck the locks before they go out; others are extremely afraid of germs and have to wash their hands many times a day. English soccer star David Beckham, for example, cannot stand odd numbers of items in his fridge. So if he has three cans of drink he will throw one out, according to his wife Victoria. Hoping to better understand OCD in humans, a team of scientists from the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied 368 dogs, including those that chase their tail for several hours daily or a few times a month, according to Sciencedaily.com. They also examined dogs that had never chased their tails. Scientists took the dogs' blood sample and asked their owners some questions about their pets' daily life. Findings showed that among all kinds of dogs, bull terriers and German shepherds were likely to chase their tails, which led scientists to believe that genes can cause OCD. Diet also plays a part. It was found that dogs that eat food with certain vitamins and minerals chased their tails less. \\"Interestingly, there are indications that vitamins and minerals are helpful in human OCD treatment,\\" said researcher Katriina Tiira. Moreover, tail-chasing is often found among dogs that were separated from their mothers too early or ones that didn't receive enough care. They are also more likely to turn out to be shyer and more afraid of loud noises at a young age. The study can help us understand the causes of OCD in humans. \\"Dogs share the same environment with humans, and large animals are physiologically close to humans,\\" said Hannes Lohi, leader...

Review: This, \\"Prodigal Son\\" and \\"Eastern Condors\\" are my favourite Sammo Hung films. The Fat Dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in \\"Condors\\", but he's no less sure-footed as director or actor. He is, in fact, at the top of his form and delivers a devastating, brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate, sweet love story also. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action, and insure that viewers don't hit the fast-forward button between the physical clashes. The opening scene, which features a funny light sabre duel, sets a solid but deceptive tone. A sequence in which Sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, comic tone. The fast and furious stick fight between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp, superb direction, and easily one of the best ever of its type. The film's violence escalates slowly until, finally, when the climactic showdown comes, we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a Sammo production. The director/actor's assault on Billy Chow and a house filled with angry, menacing opponents is a bone-cracking, physically punishing delight.

Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin, (16 April 1889 - 25 December 1977) was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona \\"the Tramp\\" and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy. Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship. Between his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage. He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot. This was an isolated occurrence, but by the time he was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing. He later wrote: \\"[she] imbued me with the feeling that I had some sort of talent\\". Through his father's connections, Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900. Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act. In the years Chaplin was touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads, his mother ensured that he still attended school but, by age 13, he had abandoned education. He supported himself with a range of jobs, while nursing his ambition to become an actor. At 14, shortly after his mother's relapse, he registered with a theatrical agency in London's West End. The manager sensed potential in Chaplin, who was promptly given his first role as a newsboy in Harry Arthur Saintsbury's Jim, a Romance of Cockayne. It opened in July 1903, but the show was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks. Chaplin's comic performance, however, was singled out for praise in many of the reviews. Saintsbury secured a role for Chaplin in Charles Frohman's production of Sherlock Holmes, where he played Billy the pageboy in three nationwide tours. His performance was so well received that he was called to London to play the role alongside William Gillette, the original Holmes. \\"It was like tidings from heaven\\", Chaplin recalled. At 16 years old, Chaplin starred in the play's West End production at the Duke of York's Theatre from October to December 1905. He completed one final tour of Sherlock Holmes in early 1906, before leaving the play after more than two-and-a-half years. Did Charlie Chaplin perform with any groups?","completion":"Yes, Charlie Chaplin performed with several groups.

It was followed by \\"Honky Tonk Badonkadonk\\", which became a crossover hit, bringing Adkins into the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time. 2006 saw the release of Adkins' seventh studio album, Dangerous Man. \\"Swing\\", the album's lead-off single, peaked at No. 20, while the follow-up \\"Ladies Love Country Boys\\" became Adkins' second Number One single on the country charts and his first since \\"(This Ain't) No Thinkin' Thing\\" in 1997. Adkins daughter, Brianna, was featured in the \\"Ladies Love Country Boys\\" video. The album's final release, \\"I Wanna Feel Something\\", proved unsuccessful on the charts; as a result, Adkins announced that he would stop supporting the single. In August 2007, Adkins released a single entitled \\"I Got My Game On\\". Originally, the song was planned to be the lead-off to a new album, tentatively titled Game On; however, Adkins decided not to release a full album, and instead released his second Greatest Hits compilation, American Man: Greatest Hits Volume II, for which \\"I Got My Game On\\" served as the lead-off single. The album has also produced Adkins' fastest-climbing single to date in its second single, \\"You're Gonna Miss This\\". \\"You're Gonna Miss This\\" has also become his third Number One hit on the Hot Country Songs, as well as the most successful single to date on the Billboard Hot 100 (#12), Billboard Pop 100 (#19), and Hot Digital Songs charts (#8). Adkins released his first book, entitled A Personal Stand: Observations and Opinions from a Free-Thinking Roughneck.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer a question about the following article about Gene: The nucleotide sequence of a gene's DNA specifies the amino acid sequence of a protein through the genetic code. Sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, each correspond to a specific amino acid.:6 Additionally, a \\"start codon\\", and three \\"stop codons\\" indicate the beginning and end of the protein coding region. There are 64 possible codons (four possible nucleotides at each of three positions, hence 43 possible codons) and only 20 standard amino acids; hence the code is redundant and multiple codons can specify the same amino acid. The correspondence between codons and amino acids is nearly universal among all known living organisms. What indicates the beginning and end of the protein coding region?","completion":"The beginning and end of the protein coding region are indicated by specific codons known as the \\"start codon\\" and \\"stop codons.\\" A start codon is a specific sequence of three nucleotides in the gene's DNA that signals the beginning of the protein coding region, while stop codons are sequences of three nucleotides that signal the end of the protein coding region. In most cases, the start codon is AUG, which codes for the amino acid methionine and marks the initiation of translation (the process of assembling amino acids to form a protein based on the mRNA template). On the other hand, there are three commonly encountered stop codons: UAA, UAG, and UGA. These stop codons do not correspond to any amino acids; instead, they serve as a signal for the translation machinery to terminate protein synthesis. They play an essential role in ensuring that the protein is synthesized accurately and completely. It is important to note that the correspondence between codons and amino acids is nearly universal among all known living organisms. This robust nature of the genetic code highlights its evolutionary conservation and fundamental role in biological systems."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here are possible answers to this question: - singing - arthritis - listening to music - making music - playing music I believe the correct choice is \\"arthritis\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Arthritis\\". This is because arthritis is a medical condition that affects one's joints, often causing discomfort, pain, inflammation, and difficulty in movement. This disease particularly affects the hands, making activities that require refined motor skills, such as playing the guitar, challenging if not impossible. Moreover, the provided question hints at the physical capacity of the rockstar and explicitly mentions his hands' inability to cooperate, indicating an issue related to physical dexterity and movement. This leads us to eliminate the other options which are basically associated with auditory perception - \\"listening to music\\", and creative music-making activities - \\"singing\\", \\"making music\\", and \\"playing music\\". All these activities mainly involve other complex processes and/or body parts, not specifically the hands' condition. Arthritis is more common among the aging population. For a musician, this could gravely impact their ability to perform or even practice. The fine motor skills and finger dexterity needed to play a string instrument like a guitar could be disrupted by the stiffness and inflammation that arthritis can cause. This could make it hard for someone to bend their fingers or grip the guitar neck properly and could cause enough discomfort so that it becomes less feasible for them to continue to play their instrument. Moreover, given the lifetime of use and practice most professional musicians have under their belts, they would be particularly susceptible to developing arthritis. Over time, the repetitive motions and constant use could wear down the joints in their hands and cause them to become inflamed, something that is characteristic of arthritis. So, out of the given options - singing, arthritis, listening to music, making music and playing music - the best and most plausible explanation for why the aging rockstar is unable to play guitar anymore is arthritis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

The Leinster side fought back and they led by point when Robbie Smyth scored the decisive goal on 62 minutes. A stunned Monaghan could only respond with a Conor McManus point in added time as their season came to an end. The reigning Ulster champions fell 1-1 to 0-0 behind after four minutes as Longford stormed out of the blocks. Quinn netted on the rebound for the opening goal on four minutes after Liam Connerton's shot was partially saved by Rory Beggan. Home captain McManus opened Monaghan's account with a pointed free followed by a brilliant score from play to make it 1-1 to 0-2 after five minutes. Longford had a fruitful spell after McManus' points as James McGivney grabbed two points before Brian Kavanagh pointed a free, giving the visitors a 1-4 to 0-2 lead after 15 minutes. Jack McCarron replied for the hosts with a well-taken point before Smyth produced a wonderful individual score on 23 minutes. Conor McCarthy scored his first point of the game on 24 minutes before Smyth replied with a free for Longford. This proved to be the visitors' last point of the half as Monaghan scored an unanswered 1-5 before half time. McCarthy scored a point either side of a McCarron effort before Walshe notched a goal for Malachy O'Rourke's men. The corner-back burst forward from defence before laying the ball off to McCarron - the Currin clubman's shot was saved by Paddy Collum but Walshe was in the right place to drive home the rebound in the 34th minute. And Monaghan rounded off the first half with a further two points. McManus pointed a free before a good score from Ryan McAnespie rounded off the half for the home side to give them a three-point lead going into the interval. Longford had the wind at their backs after half-time and needed a good start to the half to keep in touch with Monaghan. Diarmuid Masterson grabbed a score after only ten seconds before Kavanagh pointed a sideline ball to bring Longford within a point of the hosts with just two minutes played in the second half. Rory Beggan scored a long range free for Monaghan in the 40th minute but Longford kept the scoreboard ticking over and were soon level. Masterson scored his second point before another effort from McGivney made it 1-10 apiece on 44 minutes. Two points in the space of a minute for Longford saw them edge two in front - Kavanagh and Connerton providing the scores. But Monaghan came roaring back with two points of their own.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film portrays two conflicts that take place around Flagstone, a fictional town in the American Old West: a land battle related to construction of a railroad, and a mission of vengeance against a cold-blooded killer. A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men. Back at Sweetwater, construction materials are delivered to build a railroad station and a small town. Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it. Frank turns against Morton, who wanted to make a deal with Jill; Morton's disability makes him unable to fight back. After raping Jill, Frank forces her to sell the property in an auction. He tries to buy the farm cheaply by intimidating the other bidders, but Harmonica arrives, holding Cheyenne at gunpoint, and makes a much higher bid based on his reward money for delivering Cheyenne to the authorities.

Sentence: \\"The problem disappeared.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically? Choices: 1). unacceptable. 2). acceptable.","completion":"2). acceptable. A linguist would most likely rate the sentence \\"The problem disappeared\\" as acceptable linguistically. Here's a detailed analysis of why this sentence is considered acceptable: 1. Structure: The sentence follows a standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, which is the most common sentence structure in English. In this case, \\"The problem\\" is the subject, \\"disappeared\\" is the verb, and no object is necessary as \\"disappeared\\" is an intransitive verb. 2. Syntax: The sentence adheres to English syntax rules. The definite article \\"the\\" is correctly placed before the noun \\"problem,\\" and the verb \\"disappeared\\" correctly agrees with the singular noun \\"problem.\\" It is important to mention that the verb \\"disappeared\\" is a regular intransitive verb and does not require an object to complete its meaning. 3. Semantics: The sentence also makes sense semantically. The words are chosen appropriately to convey a clear and concise meaning: a problem that was previously present is now gone. 4. Style: From a stylistic perspective, the sentence's brevity and clarity are considered acceptable in English. The sentence uses a minimal number of words to convey its meaning efficiently. 5. Context: Although the sentence does not provide any explicit information about the nature of the problem or the circumstances that led to its disappearance, it is still considered acceptable. Context would need to be established in surrounding sentences to further clarify the overall meaning. In conclusion, a linguist would most likely rate \\"The problem disappeared\\" as acceptable linguistically because it follows the appropriate syntactic, semantic, and stylistic conventions of the English language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, since the reviewer used an extended version of the word \\"like\\" and incorporated a heart-eyes emoji (üòç), this suggests that they have a positive, possibly even enthusiastic, opinion about the subject being reviewed. Considering this, we can estimate that this review would be on the higher end of the rating scale, perhaps warranted as a 4- or 5-star rating. To provide a more specific rating, additional information and context would be helpful, including the type and level of enthusiasm expressed by the reviewer in other reviews, or any other qualitative indicators they use to convey their overall sentiment. Some might interpret this statement as a hyperbolic, tongue-in-cheek response, which could slightly lower the star rating, whereas others might see it as genuine enthusiasm, leading to a higher rating.

Article: Most of us seem to reach our peak of alertness around noon. Soon after that, alertness declines, and sleepiness may set in by mid-afternoon. Your short-term memory is best during the morning--in fact, about 15 percent more efficient than at any other time of day. So, students, take notice: when you are faced with a morning exam, _ to review your notes right before the test is given. However, long-term memory is different. Afternoon is the best time for learning materials that you want to recall days, weeks or months later. Politicians, business executives or others who must learn speeches would be smart to do their memorizing during that time of day. You should try to do most of your studying in the afternoon, rather than late at night. Many students believe they memorize better while burning the midnight oil because their short-term recall is better during the early hours of the morning than in the afternoon. But short-term memory won't help them much several days later, when they face the exam. By contrast, we tend to do best on tasks related to the process of knowing, understanding, and learning numbers during the morning hours. What about sports? During afternoon and early evening, you're able to react the quickest to an outside stimulus--like a baseball speeding toward you. Studies have also shown that late in the day, when your body temperature is peaking, you will consider PE easier and less tiring--whether it actually is or not. That means you are more likely to work harder during a late afternoon or early evening workout, and therefore benefit more from it. In fact, all of your senses--taste, sight, hearing, touch and smell--may be at their keenest during late afternoon and early evening. That could be why dinner usually tastes better to us than breakfast. While all of us follow the same general pattern of ups and downs, the exact timing varies from person to person.

More immediate to the time, the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire was a political event that redrew the political boundaries of West Asia.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. \\"The machine is not working,\\" hospital staff told her. \\"You should come back in four months.\\" But Betty did not have that long. \\"I had no choice but to get a private screening,\\" she said. \\"I paid ‚Ç¨600 (¬£390) out of my own pocket.\\" The 35-year-old, who founded an NGO that helps poor and homeless people in Thessaloniki, says her experiences suggest Greece's health system is increasing comparable to those she witnessed while working in the developing world - rather than that of an EU country. And from speaking to other patients and healthcare workers here, it is clear her story is broadly typical. As Greece careers towards another election later this month, the country's healthcare system is continuing to crumble. Funding for state-run hospitals has been cut by more than 50% since the debt crisis started in 2009. They suffer from severe shortages in everything, from sheets, gauzes and syringes, to doctors and nurses. By 2011, supplies were critically low, says Athena, a former nurse in a haematology unit. \\"We did not even have the most basic of materials [such as] surgical spirit.\\" Public health spending in Greece is expected to shrink to 4% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 2015, one of the worst levels in the EU. The average spend is 6.9%, according to the Panhellenic Medical Association. The National Organisation for Healthcare (EOPYY) is running a deficit of ‚Ç¨1.5bn. Allocated hospital funding, which has slowed to a crawl since March, will fall this year by more than 22% to ‚Ç¨1.18bn. A new bailout agreed with Greece's creditors by the former coalition government headed by the left-wing Syriza party will do little to address the situation, experts say, as it dictates a prolongation of austerity and spending cuts. Greeks who have the financial means are increasingly turning to the private sector. A 77-year old woman, named Nikki, recently suffered a stroke at 03:00 in the morning. The paramedics who arrived at her house in Kalamaria, an affluent Thessaloniki suburb, told her panicking son that his mother should be seen by a doctor as soon as possible. But they warned him not to take her to the local public hospital that night. \\"The hospital is overcrowded. It may take hours for her to see a doctor. You'd better get her to a private clinic,\\" they said. The son immediately drove his mother to the nearest clinic. There were no queues, but rather an abundance of medical staff to help her. But all this came at a price. She paid ‚Ç¨800 for her screening and three-day hospitalisation. Not everyone is so lucky. Most Greeks, even those who have jobs, cannot afford private healthcare. The situation is even worse for the estimated 2.5 million uninsured Greeks. Having lost their jobs and health coverage, getting access to healthcare is a huge challenge. Syriza acknowledges as much. The party's manifesto unveiled ahead of the 20 September election warns that the health crisis hurts primarily the country's poor and vulnerable. Few patients blame the medical staff - they know they are overworked and underpaid. \\"We are short on doctors and nurses. We work almost non-stop to provide for them as best we can,\\" says Athina Grammatikopoulou, a nurse at Theageneio hospital where Ms Semakoula was turned away. \\"For example a single nurse has to care for 20 or 25 patients during night shifts.\\" 10% of GDP went on healthcare in 2009 4% of GDP is the expected spend for 2015 22% decline in allocated hospital funding in 2015 5,000 more doctors needed 15,000 more nurses needed According to the government, the system requires 4,500 extra doctors and other medical and paramedical staff. But Michael Vlastarakos, President of the Panhellenic Medical Association, says the Greek healthcare system is 5,000 doctors and 15,000 nurses short. The understaffing is getting worse because of a mass exodus of doctors and nurses, who have seen their salaries cut and work hours increase. \\"In the past three years, more than 15,000 doctors have left the country, mainly for the UK, Germany, Cyprus and Sweden,\\" says Mr Vlastarakos. \\"The dramatic understaffing means, for example, that in Sparta, my hometown, the pathology clinic is no longer operating.\\" Doctors working at public hospitals in Greece earn on average about ‚Ç¨1,200 to ‚Ç¨2,000 a month - and payments are often seriously delayed. Mr Vlastarakos says low pay is one reason why the problem of the infamous \\"fakelaki\\", or illegal bribes, is still rife. \\"A patient who is told that he can only be operated in three months' time has two options: go to a private clinic or pay his way up the waiting list,\\" he says. Cancer patients are particularly vulnerable. Persefoni Mitta, head of the Association of Cancer Patients in Macedonia and Thrace, spends her days trying to help the 6,500 members of her organisation in their fight against the disease. \\"Some are sent away from the hospitals because the machine may not be working, or chemotherapy is impossible,\\" she says. \\"Others come crying because they were discharged from the hospital right after an operation.\\" What they all have in common is their outrage towards politicians. \\"They spit at politicians. And rightfully so. They should be ashamed of themselves,\\" says Ms Mitta. \\"The only thing they know how to do is hold new elections every couple of months, while people out there are suffering\\". Another problem is drug shortages. Commercial pharmacies are owed more than ‚Ç¨0.5bn by the government, according to the Panhellenic Pharmaceutical Association (PFS), so many request payment from patients up front. Iosif Vaena, a pharmacist in Thessaloniki, says shortages are real, with some drugs including insulin running low, and others becoming simply unavailable, like the polio vaccine. And even in the case of medicines that are theoretically available, patients need to pay out of their own pocket to get them. Greece pharmacist: 'Tell Europe SOS' Then there are medicines that are essential but so cheap that no company will import them. These are covered by emergency imports, but the government agency responsible has no funds to pay for them and has stopped placing orders. Cancer drugs are vital, but often inaccessible. \\"It is one thing to ask a patient to bring his own blanket to the hospital. And quite another to deny him a drug that means the difference between life and death,\\" Ms Mitta says. Sometimes doctors tell cancer patients to give up, she adds. \\"A doctor will say, 'He is 70 years old, there is no point in spending money and resources on him'. But who are they to decide?\\" She says she faced the same attitude when she was diagnosed with multiple forms of cancer 28 years ago. \\"They said I only had three months to live... But here I am, still breathing.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"The article is about the declining healthcare system in Greece. Due to the country's debt crisis starting in 2009, funding for hospitals has been cut by over 50% and this has caused severe shortages of medical supplies, doctors, and nurses. Many Greeks who can afford it have been paying for private healthcare, but most cannot afford this option. The situation is even worse for the millions of uninsured Greeks who have lost jobs and health coverage. Attempts at getting healthcare have become very difficult. The crisis has led to a severe understaffing problem, with a mass exodus of doctors and nurses seeking better pay and working conditions in other countries.

Without a second thought, I packed my bags and jumped on a plane to Singapore, and the following day I found myself looking out the airplane window at the beautiful waters surrounding the island of Langkawi off the coast of Malaysia. The last time I was in Langkawi was in 2001, when it was relatively quiet. Langkawi has come a long way since then; there are 4, 5, and even 6-star hotels, as well as spas, golfing, horseback riding and even a cable car taking visitors to the highest point on the island. At the Langkawi International Airport I met my shipmates and we were driven to Pantai Tengah with a quick pit stop for sunblock and duty-free goodies. Many other shopping opportunities abound since Langkawi was designated as a duty-free zone in 1987 to entice tourists to the island. A luxurious yacht tender picked us up. Phillipe, the first mate, maneuvered the tender between sailboats and as we went around a small island there she was, S/V Blue Gold. This majestic 10-passenger sailboat--all 165 feet of her--had been built in Italy and recently underwent a full retrofit. Once aboard, the crew welcomed us with refreshments and big smiles.

But I think it is certain that most of the early Christians understood these words of our Lord's ascension and coming again in glory. They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead. And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them. Christ seemed to have left the world. The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while. Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory. And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church. Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days.

The Glasgow Athenaeum School of Music, which is now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, made her Professor of Piano in 1892. That was 16 years before Edith Morley, thought to be the first female professor in the UK, was appointed Professor of English Language at University College, Reading, which is now the University of Reading. Stuart Harris-Logan, archives officer at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, said the Athenaeum was a comparable college to Reading. He told BBC Scotland: \\"We could not be put on a par with universities as we did not issue degrees but we know we were a college at that time. \\"That's why we can compare ourselves to another college in 1908 who had appointed a female professor.\\" He said: \\"Professor Ritter-Bondy taught with us at a pivotal time for music pedagogy in Glasgow when Allan Macbeth - an alumnus of the Leipzig Conservatorium - was seeking to establish a European-style conservatoire in Scotland, leading to the institution we have today.\\" He said there were already female teachers at the school and her elevation to a professorship was a distinct honour that had never been given to a woman before. That honour came 48 years before Margaret Fairlie was appointed Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at University College, Dundee, which was part of the University of St Andrews. She is widely recognised as the first woman to hold a professorial chair at a university in Scotland. Mr Harris-Logan said the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland had only instituted its archive in 2011 and was still discovering many aspects of its 170-year past. \\"At the time when Emma was with us we were situated in a wonderful building on Buchanan Street in the centre of Glasgow, which is now the Hard Rock Cafe, right next to the underground,\\" he says. The Athenaeum School of Music would probably have had about 200 students, who were receiving a higher level music education. It is through the research of Ms Ritter-Bondy's great-grandson that much is known about her. She was born Emma Maria Bondy in Austria in 1838 and studied at the Vienna Conservatory in the mid-1850s. She married artist Franz Ritter in Vienna in 1862 and had two children, Ida and Camillo. When Emma was widowed in 1879, she decided to leave her home in Koblenz, Germany, to start anew in Glasgow, and settled in the city by 1881. In autumn 1892, when she was appointed Professor of Piano, she also became a British citizen. Mr Harris-Logan said: \\"Perhaps one of the reasons Emma moved to Glasgow was that she was likely to have been actively recruited by Allan Macbeth around the time that the Glasgow Athenaeum was employing many talented musicians from Europe such as Henri Verbrugghen, our violin teacher and de facto head of strings, who in 1915 was headhunted to found the Sydney Conservatorium and Sydney Symphony Orchestra.\\" Mr Harris-Logan said that not much was known about Prof Ritter-Bondy's time at the school of music. He says: \\"Because the records of the Glasgow Athenaeum are so scant they prevent us from saying anything more about her. \\"We know she was giving concerts. In October 1893 she gave a concert in Athenaeum Hall with her two children, who were also musicians. \\"Her son Camillo had played violin at the Royal Academy in London and had become a violinist of some repute in later life, so the family continued to be musical after Emma.\\" \\"But the records are so scarce we can't flesh her out any more than that, which is quite frustrating really.\\" He adds: \\"As the only woman to hold such a post in an environment which was almost entirely male dominated, it put Emma at the forefront of arts education in Scotland and beyond.\\"","completion":"Emma Ritter-Bondy, appointed Professor of Piano at Glasgow Athenaeum School of Music in 1892, is now recognized as the UK's first female professor, predating previously assumed first female professor Edith Morley by 16 years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His desperation leads him to consult with a psychic medium, Marianne, who warns him that the curse has chosen him as its next target. Together, Norman and Marianne set off on a race against time to unravel Mrs. Spool's dark secrets, breaking a chain of tragic misfortunes caused by the curse. As they navigate a web of deceit and betrayal, they uncover deep-rooted ties between Mrs. Spool and some of the most prominent members of the town‚Äîa revelation that threatens to destroy the community. With the clock ticking, the duo is forced to confront their own fears and doubts, relying on each other to lift the curse before it's too late. As the town's buried secrets come to light, they discover that the key to breaking the curse lies in understanding the true nature of Mrs. Spool's demise. They learn that Mrs. Spool was not the mastermind behind the curse but a symbolic victim of the town's bigotry and corruption, forced to bear the burden of the curse. In a heart-pounding climax, Norman and Marianne confront the town's true enemy, the manipulative Mastermind, who had been using the memory of Mrs. Spool and the townspeople's fear to maintain control over Willow Creek for years. As they expose the Mastermind's deceptions, they successfully dispel the curse, freeing the town from its grip. Ultimately, the story of \\"The Secret Trophy\\" is a tale of courage, redemption, and the power of love and understanding. It explores the dark corners of human nature and the dangers of allowing fear and prejudice to rule our lives, reminding us of the importance of seeking the truth and standing up against injustice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gather your tools: You'll need a few things: - Steel wool or a scrub pad - Dish soap - Towels or paper towels - Cooking oil (like vegetable oil) 2. Clean the pan: Use the steel wool or scrub pad to gently scrub away the rust. Be sure to go all around the pan, inside and out. You may see some black or brown bits coming off - that's good, we want to remove them. 3. Wash the pan: Now, use some dish soap and warm water to wash the pan. This will help us get rid of any remaining rust or dirt. Rinse it well and make sure all the soap is gone. 4. Dry the pan: Use a towel or paper towel to dry the pan completely. We don't want any water left on it, because it could cause more rust. 5. Apply oil: Next, pour a little cooking oil onto a paper towel or cloth. Gently rub the oil all over the pan, inside and out. This will help protect the pan from rust and will make it non-stick when you cook. 6. Heat the pan: Now, place the oiled pan in your oven or on a stovetop set to low heat for about 10-15 minutes. This will help the oil \\"bake\\" onto the pan, which helps prevent rust. 7. Cool and store: Once the pan is done heating, let it cool down. Then, store it in a dry place until you're ready to use it again. Congratulations! You just fixed your rusty cast iron pan.

Then you use it to pay bills and taxes, donate some if you can and save some. I have paid out more than I earned in the past. I have been stingy occasionally and been sorry later. My biggest regret about money, however, is regarding savings. When I was 30 years old, I started saving money. Finally, I had a well-paid job with a salary that would grow with time and seniority. I purchased my home and moved in. The next logical step was to save money. So I did. In one year I put away 5,000. My goal was to build another 5,000 and start investing . I was pleased with my progress. Unfortunately, life stepped in. A family member became disabled and needed financial assistance. I could not seem to control my spending, and my checking account ran dry. My credit card bills rose. I carry no regret to any necessities that I bought for my family. However, as I look back, I realize that I did not research enough about balancing my budget before spending my savings account. I used the money to buy fast food just for convenience. I would go to the store for food when my cupboards were still not empty, because I wanted something special. I bought convenient items to save time, not considering that I was wasting money. I should have given up the name brand paper towels and used more dish rags. My 5,000 was gone quickly. That was just over 10 years ago.

It provides us with a platform to create and join events in our local area, helping create unforgettable memories with the people around us. However, despite the enormous number of events on Facebook, finding ones that cater to our interests, convenience, and preferences can sometimes be challenging. A tool that can enhance this process is Hangtime - an app designed to help you discover Facebook events that resonate with your personal taste. In this article, we will explore how Hangtime works, its advantages, and why it might just be a game-changer in the world of online event discovery. How Hangtime Works Hangtime is an innovative social event discovery app that helps you find Facebook events based on your interests and location. The platform uses machine learning algorithms to analyze your Facebook activity, past events attended, and your current preferences to curate a personalized list of suggestions. This customization ensures that the events you see are relevant and suited to your taste. Moreover, Hangtime integrates with your calendar, offering a seamless way to manage and organize your events, staying updated on event details, and even receiving notifications for upcoming events. Advantages of Hangtime 1. Personalized Event Recommendations: Hangtime uses machine learning algorithms to understand your preferences and interests. This helps generate a list of event suggestions that are not only relevant but diverse, ensuring that you have a multitude of options to choose from. 2. Popular Events at Your Fingertips: Hangtime keeps you in the loop by showcasing the most popular and talked-about events in your area. This way, you won't miss out on anything interesting or exciting happening nearby. 3. Integration with Your Calendar: Hangtime features a calendar integration that allows you to sync your planned events with your primary calendar app. This means you can keep track of your social life, work commitments, and personal appointments all in one place. 4. Discover Local Events: Hangtime enables you to explore the local community by uncovering events that you might not otherwise find through Facebook's primary interface. This can include everything from street fairs and farmers' markets to local concerts and charity events. 5. Social Networking Opportunities: Hangtime features a \\"friends\\" tab that helps you discover events your friends are attending or interested in. This can help you stay connected, develop common interests, and expand your social circle. 6. Simplified Event Management: Hangtime also offers a \\"My Events\\" tab that gives you an organized view of the events you're interested in and the ones you've signed up for.

In a caf√É¬©, an adorable brunette (Melanie Griffith) who calls herself Lulu spots him leaving without paying. After a teasing confrontation, the two leave in a car that, Lulu says, she acquired from a divorce. They embark on a bizarre adventure, including crashing and abandoning the car, stealing from a liquor store and leaving a diner without paying. Believing Charlie to be married, Lulu discloses that her real name is Audrey, and takes him to visit her mother, Peaches. Audrey now adopts a different persona, becoming a demure platinum blonde. Coming to accept Audrey's free-wheeling lifestyle, Charlie realizes he is falling in love with her. The relationship takes a dark turn when her violent ex-convict husband, Ray Sinclair (Ray Liotta), shows up at a high school reunion; Ray wants her back. Dumping his girlfriend Irene (Margaret Colin), Ray takes Audrey and Charlie on a short-lived crime spree. The trio end up in a motel room where Audrey learns Charlie is no longer happily married and, under duress, reluctantly realizes she has to stay with Ray. Ray tells Charlie to leave, warning him to keep away, but Charlie secretly tails them when they leave the motel. Charlie devises a plan to extract Audrey from Ray's grasp, and having done so, he takes Audrey to his home. Ray unexpectedly shows up and begins beating up Charlie, but in a scuffle Charlie accidentally stabs Ray, who dies. Audrey is taken away for questioning.

MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals ‚Äì well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways‚Ä¶. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I‚Äôve been using the one for Oily Skin but it‚Äôs also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‚Äòdrawing oils‚Äô that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Try to relax, take deep breaths, and act more natural on your second read, if you are asked for one. After you do a first read, the casting director may ask you to improvise or give variety. Change up how you approach the script. Alter your voice and your body language. Do a different character or persona when you perform the script.

The casting director may give you suggestions on how to perform the script or adjustments you can make on your second read. Always follow their instruction. Respond positively to their feedback and use it to make your performance better. Being able to take feedback from the casting director and run with it will show them that you are adaptable. It will also make it clear that you want the part and are willing to act as required to get it. At the end of the audition, you should thank the casting director, smile, and tell them you look forward to hearing from them.

This article is over 1 year old The head of North Korea‚Äôs spy agency has become the most senior victim of another round of apparent purges ordered by the country‚Äôs leader, Kim Jong-un, South Korean officials have said. Kim Won-hong, the state security minister and a close aide to the leader, was sacked in mid-January after being accused of corruption, abuse of power and human rights abuses, according to the unification ministry in Seoul, which handles cross-border issues. It is not clear whether he has been permanently banished or ordered to undergo ‚Äúre-education‚Äù with a view to being brought back into Kim Jong-un‚Äôs inner circle. His removal has not been confirmed by North Korea. Kim Jong-un, 33, has presided over several high-profile purges since he became leader in late 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il. Officials considered a threat to Kim have faced punishments ranging from dismissal to execution. Little is ever revealed about the nature of their alleged crimes. Estimates quoted by South Korean media put the number of military and government officials killed in the purges at more than 100. In December 2013 Kim showed he was ready to deal ruthlessly with dissent when he ordered the execution of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, for alleged crimes that included planning a coup. Last year Kim ordered the execution of Ri Yong-jin, a senior official in the education ministry, for falling asleep at a meeting chaired by Kim. According to South Korea‚Äôs intelligence agency, Hyun Yong-chol, a former North Korean defence chief, was executed with an anti-aircraft gun, reportedly for disrespectful behaviour including napping during a military rally attended by the leader. In some cases, however, reports of mass executions and sackings have proved unreliable. Jeong Joon-hee, a unification ministry spokesman, would not reveal how South Korea had learned of Kim Won-hong‚Äôs dismissal, but said other officials were also thought to have been sacked as part of an investigation by the ruling Korean Workers‚Äô party into alleged abuse of power at the ministry of state security. Jeong said the sacked Kim, 72, had been instrumental in conducting North Korea‚Äôs ‚Äúreign of terror‚Äù against its citizens, adding that his sacking could mark the start of a period of political uncertainty for the regime. ‚ÄúThere is always a possibility that purges continue as part of constantly strengthening power,‚Äù Jeong said, according to Yonhap. ‚ÄúInstability in the North Korean regime is likely to increase as the elite members may become agitated and the regime‚Äôs control over ordinary North Koreans could weaken.‚Äù The South Korean news agency said the state security ministry wielded considerable power in its role screening ‚Äúanti-reactionary‚Äù elements in North Korean society, running political prison camps and preventing potential defectors from fleeing the country. ||||| Story highlights Kim Won Hong fired for human rights abuses in prison camp system Minister of State Security faced sanctions from US Treasury Department (CNN) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has fired one of his top lieutenants, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry. As Minister of State Security, Kim Won Hong oversaw the North Korean agency responsible for running the country's notorious prison camps, rooting out spies in North Korea and conducting counterespionage operations abroad. Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee said Kim Won Hong was punished for \\"human rights abuses committed during interrogations at the State Security Department\\" among other things. The security chief was one of seven North Korean officials sanctioned by the US Treasury Department on January 11 for human rights abuses. He was removed from his position in the North Korean government around that time, the South Korean official said. Read More ||||| SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has dismissed its minister of state security, a key aide to the reclusive state‚Äôs young leader, Kim Jong Un, South Korea said on Friday, in what a high-profile defector said would be another sign of a ‚Äúcrack in the elite‚Äù in Pyongyang if true. FILE PHOTO - North Korean member of the State Affairs Commission Kim Won Hong's profile picture is shown in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang June 30, 2016. REUTERS/KCNA/File Photo Kim Won Hong was removed from office as head of the feared ‚Äúbowibu‚Äù, or secret police, in mid-January apparently on charges of corruption, abuse of power and human rights abuses, Jeong Joon-hee, South Korea‚Äôs Unification Ministry spokesman, said, confirming media reports. Jeong did not say how the South knew of Kim‚Äôs ouster. But he said there could have been further dismissals in the North where the ruling Workers‚Äô Party‚Äôs powerful Organisation and Guidance Department was investigating the ministry of state security. ‚ÄúThere is always a possibility that purges continue as part of constantly strengthening power,‚Äù he told a briefing, adding punishment for Kim could be more severe depending on the outcome of the investigation, but he had been dismissed and demoted from the rank of general to major general. Kim Jong Un became leader in 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, and his consolidation of power has included purges and executions of top officials, South Korean officials have said. Last year, North Korea‚Äôs vice premier for education was executed for not keeping his posture upright at a public event, South Korea said. Thae Yong Ho, North Korea‚Äôs former deputy ambassador to London who has defected to the South, told Reuters he was not surprised by the news. ‚ÄúI cannot confirm if the reports are true or not, but this kind of power struggle is quite normal in North Korean history. Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un‚Äôs style of control is always one of collective surveillance that checks the power of each organization. ‚ÄúKim Jong Un has killed too many high officials and there are a lot of complaints and dissent amongst the high elite because of it. If the demotion of Kim Won Hong is really true, then that‚Äôs another sign of a crack in the North Korean elite group.‚Äù It is difficult to independently verify news about top officials in the North, which has angered the West with a series of missile and nuclear weapons tests in defiance of U.N. resolutions and sanctions. Some reports of executions and purges have proved inaccurate. North Korea rarely announces purges or executions, although state media confirmed the 2012 execution of Kim‚Äôs uncle, Jang Song Thaek, widely considered the country‚Äôs second most powerful leader, for factionalism and crimes damaging to the economy. A former defense minister, Hyun Yong Chol, is also believed to have been executed in 2015 for treason, according to the South‚Äôs spy agency. It said he was killed with an anti-aircraft gun. Impoverished North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Afonso de Albuquerque was born in 1453 in Alhandra, near Lisbon. He was the second son of Goncalo de Albuquerque, Lord of Vila Verde dos Francos, and Dona Leonor de Menezes. His father held an important position at court and was connected by remote illegitimate descent with the Portuguese monarchy. He was educated in mathematics and Latin at the court of Afonso V of Portugal, where he befriended Prince John, the future King John II of Portugal. The fleet left Lisbon on 6 April 1506. Afonso piloted his ship himself, having lost his appointed pilot on departure. In Mozambique Channel, they rescued Captain Joao da Nova, who had encountered difficulties on his return from India; da Nova and his ship, the Frol de la mar, joined da Cunha's fleet. From Malindi, da Cunha sent envoys to Ethiopia, which at the time was thought to be closer than it actually is. Those included the priest Joao Gomes, Joao Sanches and Tunisian Sid Mohammed who, having failed to cross the region, headed for Socotra; from there, Afonso managed to land them in Filuk. After successful attacks on Arab cities on the east Africa coast, they conquered Socotra and built a fortress at Suq, hoping to establish a base to stop the Red Sea commerce to the Indian Ocean. However, Socotra was abandoned four years later, as it was not advantageous as a base. At Socotra, they parted ways: Tristao da Cunha sailed for India, where he would relieve the Portuguese besieged at Cannanore, while Afonso took seven ships and 500 men to Ormuz in the Persian Gulf, one of the chief eastern centers of commerce. On his way, he conquered the cities of Curiati (Kuryat), Muscat in July 1507, and Khor Fakkan, accepting the submission of the cities of Kalhat and Sohar. He arrived at Ormuz on 25 September and soon captured the city, which agreed to become a tributary state of the Portuguese king. Hormuz was then a tributary state of Shah Ismail of Persia. In a famous episode, shortly after it's conquest Albuquerque was confronted by Persian envoys, who demanded the payment of the due tribute from him instead. He ordered them be given a stock of cannonballs, arrows and weapons, retorting that \\"such was the currency struck in Portugal to pay the tribute demanded from the dominions of King Manuel\\" According to Bras de Albuquerque, it was Shah Ismael who coined the term \\"Lion of the seas\\", addressing Albuquerque as such. Afonso began building the Fort of Our Lady of Victory (later renamed Fort of Our Lady of the Conception), engaging his men of all ranks in the work. However, some of his officers revolted against the heavy work and climate and, claiming that Afonso was exceeding his orders, departed for India. With the fleet reduced to two ships and left without supplies, he was unable to maintain this position for long. Forced to abandon Ormuz in January 1508, he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of Socotra, returned to Ormuz, and then headed to India.

Fact 2: Cancer is a family of diseases that is characterized by cells that replicate too rapidly. Given the two facts above, cancer is characterized by cells doing what out of control? A:","completion":"Given the two facts provided, cancer is characterized by cells d). replicating out of control. Cancer is indeed a complex group of diseases that involves abnormal cell growth with a potential to invade and spread to other parts of the body. The process generally begins when cells divide and grow uncontrollably due to a malfunction in the usual regulation that normally keeps cell division in check. In a healthy individual, cells have a natural life cycle: they grow, divide, and die when they reach the end of their life span. This entire process is carefully regulated by the body. However, in the case of cancer, certain changes in the genetic material of cells (DNA) cause them to become cancerous. These cells begin to divide uncontrollably and form malignant tumors, invading nearby tissue and spreading to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. This rapid and uncontrolled division and growth is caused by damaged or altered DNA and leads to an accumulation of abnormal cells that ultimately form a mass or tumor. In conclusion, cancer is characterized by cells that are replicating out of control, as these cells do not undergo the normal life cycle of growth, division, and death. This results in the formation of tumors and the spread of cancer to other parts of the body, greatly impacting the health and well-being of affected individuals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"In order to answer this question, I will first gather information on the locations of Zibo and Huaiyin District, Huai'an to determine which, if either, is located in the central Shandong province of China. Step 1: Research the location of Zibo. Zibo is a prefecture-level city in the Shandong province of China. It lies towards the east of the province, with its center approximately 114 kilometers east-northeast of the provincial capital Jinan.

This quest leads him to challenge Lancey \`\` The Man '' Howard , an older player widely considered to be the best , culminating in a climactic final poker hand between the two . The script , adapted from Richard Jessup 's novel , was written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern ; it was Lardner 's first major studio work since his 1947 blacklisting as one of The Hollywood Ten . The film was directed by Norman Jewison and stars Steve McQueen in the title role and Edward G. Robinson as Howard . Jewison , who replaced original director Sam Peckinpah shortly after filming began , describes The Cincinnati Kid as his \`\` ugly duckling '' film . He considers it the film that allowed him to transition from the lighter comedic films he had previously been making and take on more serious films and subjects . The film garnered mixed reviews from critics on its initial release ; supporting actors Robinson and Joan Blondell earned award nominations for their performances . - A card game is any game using playing cards as the primary device with which the game is played, be they traditional or game-specific. Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as poker). A small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules, but most are folk games whose rules vary by region, culture, and person. - Poker is a family of gambling card games, but is often considered a skill based game. All poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play, and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players' cards, at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand.

Weeds are plants that grow where people don‚Äôt want them, such as gardens and lawns. They take up space and use resources, hindering the growth of more desirable plants. People often introduce plants to new habitats where they lack natural predators and parasites. The introduced plants may spread rapidly and drive out native plants. Many plants produce pollen, which can cause allergies. Plants may also produce toxins that harm human health (see Figure below ).

A: A:","completion":"Plants that grow where people don't want them to, and which can take up space and use resources that hinder the growth of more desirable plants, are known as weeds. Weeds can be a nuisance in gardens, lawns, and other areas where their presence is unwanted. They compete with desired plants for essential elements like sunlight, water, and nutrients, ultimately leading to reduced growth and productivity of the preferred vegetation. In some cases, weeds may also be introduced to new habitats where they lack natural predators and parasites, and this can result in rapid spreading and displacement of native plants. Weeds can have a detrimental impact on the overall health and appearance of their surroundings, often requiring significant time, effort, and resources to manage and control."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: A:","completion":"The change in momentum equals the average net external force multiplied by the time this force acts. In the given equation, Œîp represents the change in momentum and is equal to the product of the net external force (F net) and the time interval during which the force acts (Œît).

The answer is:","completion":"Before Addison can settle down to watch a movie after finishing her studies, there are a few steps and considerations she should take into account. These are: 1. Time Management: Addison should ensure that she has completed all necessary academic tasks for the day, such as study sessions, assignments, or projects, before allocating time to relax and watch a movie. This will ensure that she doesn't fall behind on her work and also allows her to fully enjoy her leisure time without the burden of uncompleted tasks looming over her. 2. Select a Movie: Addison should spend some time looking for the perfect movie to watch, taking into consideration her mood, preferences, and any recommendations from friends or family. She can choose to either watch a movie from her personal collection or search for a suitable option on various streaming platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime. 3. Set Up a Comfortable Environment: To ensure maximum enjoyment while watching the movie, Addison should prepare her viewing space by finding a comfortable spot to sit or lie down. She may also want to adjust the lighting, temperature, and make any other adjustments to create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. In addition, she could prepare a soft blanket or a fluffy pillow for added relaxation. 4. Secure Snacks and Refreshments: Watching a movie is usually a more enjoyable experience when accompanied by tasty snacks and beverages. Addison should take a quick trip to the kitchen to prepare her favorite treats, such as popcorn, candies, or chips, as well as a refreshing drink, like soda, water, or tea. 5. Gathering Necessary Devices and Accessories: In order to watch the movie, Addison needs to ensure that she has all the required devices and accessories, such as a TV, laptop, or tablet screen, as well as speakers or headphones for optimal audio experience. Additionally, she should check that she has all necessary remote controls, chargers, or streaming devices. 6. Inform Family Members or Roommates: To avoid interruptions or distractions during the movie, Addison should let any family members or roommates know that she will be watching a movie and would appreciate minimal disturbances. This is especially important if she is watching the movie in a shared space where others might be present. 7. Test the Movie and Audio: Before starting the movie, it's a good idea for Addison to play a few seconds of the film to check if the audio and video quality are up to par. This can save her from any potential frustrations of dealing with technical glitches during the movie. 8. Set the Appropriate Volume: Depending on whether Addison is watching the movie alone or with others, she should ensure the volume is set to a comfortable level that allows for an immersive experience without causing disturbance to others in the vicinity.

Now it turns out that doctors have been warning kids don't get enough sleep for over a century--long before iPads, and texting robbed children of peaceful sleep. What's more, there's no solid scientific basis for pediatricians' recommendations on the amount of time children need to sleep. That's the word from researchers in Australia. It turns out that children are sleeping less than those in days of old. The researchers, at the University of South Australia's Health and Use of Time Group, found that kids' nightly sleep time declined by about three-quarters of a minute each year for the period they studied. My daughter was more likely to beg for a few more minutes of Angry Birds before bedtime.That means nowadays my daughter is sleeping about 50 minutes a night less than her grandfather who had to get up to milk the cows at 5:30 am. What hasn't changed is the predictions from health professionals on the consequences of lack of sleep. \\"This is a sleepless age and more and more... we are turning night into day,\\" one expert said in 1905. Back then, sleep was seen as a way to restore \\"wearied brain tissue\\". Children and \\"clever\\" children were thought to be most at risk, and most in need of energy-restoring sleep. The words may be different today, but the threats are pretty much the same. Parents are told that children risk mental and physical problems, and even obesity, if they don't get enough sleep. So the Australians looked to see how much sleep kids do need. The answer is the biggest surprise of this study--no one really knows. \\"There is almost no exact evidence for proper sleep for children,\\" the authors write. Their work was published in the journal Pediatrics.

Here is an article: The administration‚Äôs bungling on Iran makes for strange bedfellows. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (2nd L) shakes hands with US Secretary of State John Kerry next to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (far L) and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius (far R) in Geneva. (COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images) From the cold-eyed school of realism, France is making known that the interim deal is problematic and can‚Äôt be the basis of a final deal. The Wall Street Journal reports that France‚Äôs foreign minister Laurent Fabius is skeptical that what we are doing will disarm Iran. He is quoted as saying, ‚ÄúWe have to implement honestly the first phase. . . . ‚ÄúThen my main concern is the second phase. It is unclear if the Iranians will accept to definitively abandon any capacity of getting a weapon or only agree to interrupt the nuclear program.‚Äù And that really is the rub. Iran has not been required to admit to and account for its illegal weapons or to take irreversible steps to disable it. France now is sounding the same red line as Israel ‚Äî namely, that the issue is ‚Äúbreakout capacity‚Äù and not an actual weapon. (‚ÄúMr. Fabius said Western powers need to focus their efforts on how to deprive Iran of ‚Äòbreakout capacity,‚Äô the ability to restart a bomb-making program from dormant nuclear sites and make a quick dash to a weapon before world powers can react. ‚ÄòWhat is at stake is to ensure that there is no breakout capacity,‚Äô Mr. Fabius said.‚Äù) France‚Äôs own experience in negotiating with Iran and seeing it renege informs his skepticism that Iran will negotiate away its nuclear program. While France appeals to cold-hard reason, the moral clarity is provided by Elie Wiesel, who took out an ad in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. (The last time he did this was to denounce the administration‚Äôs ‚Äúcondemnation‚Äù of Israel for building in its capital.) Like the French, Wiesel lets it be known he doesn‚Äôt trust the mullahs: ‚ÄúIf there is one lesson I hope the world has learned from the past it is that regimes rooted in brutality must never be trusted. And the words and actions of the leadership of Iran leave no doubt as to their intentions.‚Äù He then implores Congress to act: I appeal to President Obama and Congress to demand, as a condition of continued talks, the total dismantling of Iran‚Äôs nuclear infrastructure and the regime‚Äôs public and complete repudiation of all genocidal intent against Israel. And I appeal to the leaders of the United States Senate to go forward with their vote to strengthen sanctions against Iran until these conditions have been met. I once wrote that history has taught us to trust the threats of our enemies more than the promises of our friends. Our enemies are making serious threats. It is time to take them seriously. It is time for our friends to keep their promises. That appeal is aimed squarely at the administration‚Äôs attempt to squirm away from three presidents‚Äô policy and six United Nations resolutions, all of which say Iran can not keep its illegal enrichment program. Why can‚Äôt that be adhered to? Well, the Iranians won‚Äôt do it. Aside from acknowledging that it has therefore let the Iranian threat get totally out of hand, the White House in effect takes military force off the table. That was the ultimate guarantor of Iran‚Äôs compliance and now we say compliance is impossible. Ergo: Military force is no longer an option. (Some of us never believed it was for this president.) The pressure from both France and Wiesel illustrate the two compelling critiques of the Obama policy: It won‚Äôt work (say the French) and it is a repudiation, says Wiesel, by America of its solemn promise to Israel and the world that the nuclear threat of a genocidal regime would be eliminated. If you want to talk legacy, how they handle Iran, arguably will be the single most important thing the president and Congress will do in their tenure in public office. Sometimes it takes a foreign power and an adopted citizen to remind us that the stakes are huge and America must act wisely and morally.

A Cezanne, it sells for a fabulous 515,000, the high point of the auction. When Bonnet's daughter, Nicole (Audrey Hepburn), hears the news on her car radio on her way home from work, she is shocked...and dismayed.

He is putting the finishing touches on his latest project, a flawless rendition of a famous lost Van Gogh. He has even found another painting from the same period, by an unknown artist, and has brushed dirt from the back of that canvas to transfer to his forgery. \\"I doubt if even Van Gogh himself would have gone to such pains with his work,\\" he boasts. \\"He didn't have to, Papa,\\" Nicole retorts, \\"he WAS Van Gogh!\\" She tells him in a tired voice (for what must surely be the thousandth time) that it's a crime to sell fake masterpieces. He replies that he only sells them to wealthy, private buyers, who get an undeniably fine painting in return.A noise in the driveway sends them both to the window: An armored car, a police van, a black limousine and half a dozen motorcycles have arrived and parked in front of the house.

Joseph Patrick Kennedy Sr. (September 6, 1888 - November 18, 1969) was an American businessman, investor, and politician known for his high-profile positions in United States politics. Kennedy was married to Rose Kennedy, and three of their nine children attained distinguished political positions: President John F. Kennedy (1917-1963), Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy (1925-1968), and longtime Senator Edward M. \\"Ted\\" Kennedy (1932-2009). He was a leading member of the Democratic Party and of the Irish Catholic community. Kennedy's close ties with Republican (GOP) Senator Joseph McCarthy strengthened his family's position among Irish Catholics, but weakened it among liberals who strongly opposed McCarthy. Even before McCarthy became famous in 1950, Kennedy had forged close ties with the Republican Senator. Kennedy often brought him to his family compound at Hyannis Port as a weekend house guest in the late 1940s. McCarthy at one point dated Patricia Kennedy. When McCarthy became a dominant voice of anti-Communism starting in 1950, Kennedy contributed thousands of dollars to McCarthy, and became one of his major supporters. In the Senate race of 1952, Kennedy apparently worked a deal so that McCarthy, a Republican, would not make campaign speeches for the GOP ticket in Massachusetts. In return, Congressman John F. Kennedy, running for the Senate seat, would not give any anti-McCarthy speeches that his liberal supporters wanted to hear. At Kennedy's urging in 1953, McCarthy hired Robert Kennedy (age 27) as a senior staff member of the Senate's investigations subcommittee, which McCarthy chaired. In 1954, when the Senate was threatening to condemn McCarthy, Senator John Kennedy faced a dilemma. \\"How could I demand that Joe McCarthy be censured for things he did when my own brother was on his staff?\\" asked JFK. By 1954 Robert F. Kennedy and McCarthy's chief aide Roy Cohn had had a falling out, and Robert no longer worked for McCarthy. John Kennedy had a speech drafted calling for the censure of McCarthy but he never delivered it. When the Senate voted to censure McCarthy on December 2, 1954, Senator Kennedy was in the hospital and never indicated how he would cast his vote. Joe Kennedy strongly supported McCarthy to the end.","completion":"This text is about Joseph Patrick Kennedy Sr., an American businessman, investor, and politician.

These are being used as a low cost decorative alternative for traditional light bulbs that are being phased out in many countries. The filaments require a rather high voltage to light to nominal brightness, allowing them to work efficiently and simply with mains voltages. Often a simple rectifier and capacitive current limiting are employed to create a low-cost replacement for a traditional light bulb without the complexity of creating a low voltage, high current converter which is required by single die LEDs.

After New Zealand's quarter-final elimination from the World Cup, which was their worst finish in a World Cup tournament, Graham Henry's contract was indeed up for renewal. Despite the team's poor showing, he was made to re-apply for the role, which he successfully achieved. The steps to this conclusion include: 1. Recalling the specific timeframe ‚Äì the 2007 Rugby Union World Cup. 2. Identifying the team in question ‚Äì New Zealand's rugby team, the All Blacks. 3. Identifying the coach of the All Blacks during this period ‚Äì Graham Henry. 4. Recalling the event following the World Cup ‚Äì Graham Henry was made to re-apply for his job, which he achieved successfully.

In this confessional age, TV, radio and print rely for much of their content on the sad stories of those 'victims' of life. The story goes something like this: There is the future 'victim' getting on with their quotidian activities and whoosh, they are whisked into a life of gambling, drugs, sex or junk food addiction. After years of struggle, they finally find redemption and become good people again. As in any good tale of redemption, there has to be a 'reason' for why our 'victim' fell off the rails. Take your pick: they were molested, their parents ran away from home, they were denied desserts except on Sundays. Just thinking about it brings a tear to my stony face. How can you not be moved by tales such as these. What is the precipitating cause of the misery in my life? Well, my mother was French and my father was English. And to make things worse, I was brought up Catholic! Yes folks, in today's shorthand of grievance, I'm a half-breed straddling Canada's great language divide and a religious bigot. My hometown was a mixture of French and English-speaking people and the results of their miscenagation. You could never tell by someone's last name who spoke your language (For instance, my good friend P. Arsenault spoke the Queen's English and my cousin Sean Doyle wouldn't have recognized an Oxford Dictionary if you shoved up his nose). As children, we were segregated by language; all the French-speaking kids went to one side of the school where they spoke French all the time. I was fortunate enough to be sent to the English side of the school and got to speak my native tongue. My parents decided my brother and sister wouldn't be quite so lucky. In an effort to bridge the great language divide, they both spent six years learning everything in French and mingling with the French people (My parents did this because it was the firm belief of all forward-thinking families that whatever road you took would be much smoother if you could speak both of Canada's official languages.

Article: When I learned that my 71-year-old mother was playing Scrabble--a word game--against herself, I knew I had to do something. My husband suggested we give her a computer to play against. I wasn't sure my mother was ready for it. After all, it had taken 15 years to persuade her to buy an electric cooker. Even so, we packed up our old computer and delivered it to my parents' home. And so began my mother's adventure in the world of computers. It also marked the beginning of an unusual teaching task for me. I've taught people of all ages, but I never thought I would be teaching my mother how to do anything. She has been the one teaching me all my life; to cook and sew; to enjoy the good times and put up with the bad. Now it was my turn to give something back. It wasn't easy at the beginning. There was so much to explain and to introduce. Slowly but surely, my mother caught on, making notes in a little notebook. After a few months of Scrabble and other games, I decided it was time to introduce her to word processing . This proved to be a bigger challenge to her, so I gave her some homework. I asked her to write me a letter, using different letter types, colors and spaces. \\"Are you demanding this with your kindergarten pupils?\\" she said. \\"No, of course not,\\" I said. \\"They already know how to use a computer.\\" My mother isn't the only one experiencing a fast personal growth period. Thanks to the computer, my father has finally got over his phone allergy .

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with various aspects of their experience. Firstly, the reviewer addresses the considerable delay in receiving their food, citing that it took over an hour for the plates to be served. This indicates that the timeliness and efficiency of the restaurant did not meet their expectations. Secondly, the quality of the food is described as \\"substandard relative to pricing.\\" This suggests that the reviewer found the dishes to be of a lower quality than what they expected for the price, leading to disappointment and a perceived lack of value for money. However, the review does include some neutral comments. The reviewer mentions that the restaurant has a \\"nice setting,\\" which hints that the ambiance or location of the restaurant might have been pleasant but is not enough to outweigh the negative aspects of their experience. Additionally, the service is described as \\"average,\\" indicating that while it was not particularly impressive or noteworthy, it didn't significantly contribute to the negative sentiment of the review. In other words, it was neither a redeeming factor nor an additional detractor. Lastly, the reviewer states that the food was \\"horrible,\\" further emphasizing their negative sentiment and dissatisfaction with the overall dining experience. In conclusion, the negative aspects of the review (namely, the delay in food delivery, substandard quality of the dishes, and the horrible taste) dominate the reviewer's sentiment, making it predominantly negative.

Alex, who is Patchi's mentor, tries to help Patchi impress a female Pachyrhinosaurus named Juniper, but her herd migrates south without him. Bulldust moves his herd south as well, but when they try to pass through a forest, they are forced to flee when a storm strikes and a fire erupts. Taking advantage of the chaos, a pack of Gorgosaurus attacks the scattered herd. They kill the rest of Patchi and Scowler's family while their leader Gorgon fights and kills Bulldust. Afterwards, Patchi's herd (now led by Bulldust's rival Major) combines with Juniper's as they continue their migration. There, Gorgon's pack attacks them again. In the ensuing chaos, Patchi, Scowler, and Juniper fall into a river and are swept downstream to the ocean, with Alex following them from above.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: People with strong social connections tend to cope with different life circumstances in a healthier way than those without these connections. Make new social connections to support you as you manage your anxiety. Join a local support group for anxiety-sufferers, participate in a religious or spiritual organization, or get together frequently with your favorite group of close friends. Having a sense of belonging and reassurance from others can have drastic effects on overall health. In fact, research shows that elderly individuals with poor perceived social support were at a higher risk of mortality. Feeling lonely may be more dangerous to your health than obesity and could shorten your lifespan similarly to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. For that reason, it's important to spend time with others. Sleep and anxiety have a complex chicken-or-the-egg relationship. A lack of sleep can cause anxiety, and anxiety can result in sleep disturbance. To gain control of your anxiety, focus on getting at least seven hours of sleep each night. Use the following tips to get adequate shut-eye: Allow your body to adjust to sleeping on a regular schedule. Go to bed at the same time each day. Turn off electronics 1 hour prior to bed. Make your bedroom environment comfortable and strictly for sleeping. Get your bedroom cool and dark. Exercise, but not in the 2-3 hours before bed. Develop a winding down ritual to follow nightly. Use aromatherapy like lavender scents to promote relaxation. Don't drink caffeine after noon. Avoid eating right before bed. Spend time in the sun every day. Quit smoking (nicotine can affect sleep). Don't drink alcohol in the 2 hours before you go to bed. In addition to maintaining overall physical health, exercise can have a profound impact on mental well-being. Physical activity generates endorphins, which are the body's feel-good chemicals. As a result, engaging in exercise regularly can relieve stress and distract you from worries. Doctors suggest getting approximately 30 minutes of exercise each day of the week. If you can't do it all at 1 time, it's okay to break it up into 10 minute blocks. Walk, jog, row, or bike ‚Äî it's up to you. Just choose an activity that you will commit to. You may not understand the connection between what you eat and how you feel, but it's definitely there. Certain foods and beverages like refined sugar or caffeine, may worsen anxiety. Instead, drink plenty of water and eat healthy meals with a balance of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean protein. Base your diet around fresh produce, fish, beans, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and healthy oils, which support mental health. However, cut out processed foods and treats, which can negatively affect your mental health. Prebiotics and probiotics are both essential to your gut health. While you can take supplements, you can also find food sources. Eat fruits and vegetables that are high in fiber to increase your consumption of prebiotics. For instance, eat asparagus, tomatoes, mango, onions, apples, and bananas. For probiotics, eat yogurt with live or active cultures, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso soup, kefir, tempeh, and kombucha. There are heaps of research connecting caffeine to increased anxiety. Caffeine has been found to increase anxiety, depression, and hostility. Avoid caffeine in soda, coffee and tea (go for decaf), and even chocolate. You might drink alcohol to ease anxiety but find that it eventually worsens your condition. Look for a healthy outlet to stress and anxiety, such as listening to music or calling a friend, rather than turning to drugs or alcohol. When battling a mental illness such as anxiety, you might become so focused on getting better and fulfilling responsibilities that you forget to practice regular self-care. Follow a routine to make sure you take care of your basic needs every day, like eating regular meals, bathing, and brushing your teeth. Additionally, do something for yourself every day to relieve stress. Make it extra special so that you have something to look forward to daily. Clean your living space weekly so it doesn't get too messy. Additionally, pay your bills each month on a set day. Give yourself something to look forward to each day, whether it is a talk with a friend, a dip in a hot bath, your favorite cup of (decaf) tea, or your favorite sitcom.

She won the Eurovision Song Contest 1968 with the song \\"La, la, la\\", beating the British pop singer Cliff Richard's \\"Congratulations\\". - Singer-songwriters are musicians who write, compose, and perform their own musical material, including lyrics and melodies. - \\"Francoist Spain\\" (also historically \\"Nationalist Spain\\" during the Spanish Civil War) refers to the period of Spanish history between 1939, when Francisco Franco took control of Spain from the government of the Second Spanish Republic after winning the Civil War, and 1978, when the Spanish Constitution of 1978 went into effect. It is the opinion of several historians that during the Spanish Civil War, Franco's goal was to turn Spain into a totalitarian state like Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. However, its entry into the war on the Axis side was prevented largely by, as was much later revealed, British Secret Intelligence Service (MI-6) efforts that included up to 200 million in bribes for Spanish officials to keep the regime from getting involved. Franco was also able to take advantage of the resources of the Axis Powers and chose to avoid becoming heavily involved in the Second World War. Franco's regime evolved into a more classical autocratic regime. - \`\` Marianne '' was the Italian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1968 , performed in Italian by Sergio Endrigo . The song is a ballad , with Endrigo expressing his love for the titular character . He sings , however , that she never stays with him , and he wonders about what she is doing . Nonetheless , his feelings for her remain unaltered . The song was performed eleventh on the night ( following France 's Isabelle Aubret with \`\` La source '' and preceding the United Kingdom 's Cliff Richard with \`\` Congratulations ) '' . At the close of voting , it had received 7 points , placing it 10th in a field of 17 . Following the Contest , it was rewritten in English by Mike Sammes and Bill Owen for Cliff Richard to perform . Richard recorded a minor hit with his rendition of the song . It was succeeded as Italian representative at the 1969 Contest by Iva Zanicchi with \`\` Due grosse lacrime bianche '' . - Sir Cliff Richard (born Harry Rodger Webb, 14 October 1940) is a British pop singer, musician, performer, actor and philanthropist. Richard has sold more than 250 million records worldwide. He has total sales of over 21 million singles in the United Kingdom and is the third-top-selling artist in UK Singles Chart history, behind the Beatles and Elvis Presley. - Joan Manuel Serrat i Teresa (born 27 December 1943) is a Spanish musician, singer-songwriter, recording artist, and performer. He is considered one of the most important figures of modern, popular music in both the Spanish and Catalan languages. - The Eurovision Song Contest, sometimes popularly called Eurovision but not to be confused with the Eurovision network that broadcasts it, is the longest-running annual international TV song competition, held, primarily, among the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) since 1956. The competition was based upon the existing Sanremo Music Festival held in Italy since 1951. - Sergio Endrigo (15 June 1933 7 September 2005) was an Italian singer-songwriter. - The Eurovision Song Contest 1968 was the 13th Eurovision Song Contest.

Subtract 78 from both sides of the equation: 124*w + 78 - 78 = -1410 - 78 124*w = -1488 Now we have the term with the variable w isolated. To solve for w, we need to remove the coefficient, which is 124 in this case: 4. Divide both sides of the equation by 124: (124*w) / 124 = -1488 / 124 w = -12 Thus, the solution to the equation 124*w + 78 = -166 - 1244 is w = -12."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Two brothers were land owners. Bill owned 40 acres of forest, , with very well developed soil. His brother Rick owned 40 acres of grasslands, with a poor soil. Rick decided to sell his land. Which brother owned a land which had lower amounts of fulvic acid? The answer is:","completion":"Rick. Step 1: Identify the information given in the question. - Soil is well developed in forests with thick humus layers and rich diversity of large trees and animals. - Precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in forests, leading to excess water percolating through soil layers. - Slow decomposition rates in forests result in large amounts of fulvic acid, enhancing chemical weathering. - Podzolization in forests leads to leaching of Mg, Fe, and Al from soil layers, creating marked contrasts in appearance and chemistry. - Bill owns 40 acres of forest with well-developed soil. - Rick owns 40 acres of grasslands with poor soil. Step 2: Compare the information given about forests and grasslands. - Forests have well-developed soil with higher amounts of fulvic acid due to slow decomposition rates and excess water in soil layers. - Grasslands have poorer soil as compared to forests, which suggests lower amounts of fulvic acid. Step 3: Determine which brother owns land with lower amounts of fulvic acid. - Bill owns forest land, which is associated with higher amounts of fulvic acid. - Rick owns grassland, which is typically associated with lower amounts of fulvic acid. Based on the information provided and the comparison between forests and grasslands, Rick owns land with lower amounts of fulvic acid."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hypothesis: The woman is wearing a red dress .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Choices: [a]. yes. [b]. it is not possible to tell. [c]. no.","completion":"[c]. no. From the initial situation or premise, it is not possible to come to the conclusion presented in the hypothesis. The two scenarios depicted are distinct and unrelated. The premise discusses a man in a blue shirt and a hard hat, possibly indicating that he is at a work site or on a construction job. There is no additional info provided concerning any other individuals, let alone specifics about their attire. The hypothesis, on the other hand, describes a woman in a red dress, a scenario completely unrelated to the premise. We have no information connecting the lady to the man in the blue shirt and hard hat, nor do we get any data to imply that the woman exists in the same setting or context. The hypothesis quite essentially emerges out of nowhere in the context of the description available. Therefore, without any cues or context to link the premise to the hypothesis, it is incorrect to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. To establish such a relationship, we would need additional information that connects the two situations or further defines the context in which they exist. For instance, if the premise had stated something like, \\"A blurry picture of a man in a blue shirt and hard hat, standing next to a woman,\\" we might then have a basis to speculate about the woman in the hypothesis. Alternatively, if the hypothesis had been something like, \\"The man's shirt is dirty from the day's work,\\" that could potentially relate back to the man mentioned in the premise.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: was lonely B: get to know Casey C: introduce herself to Casey Answer:","completion":"Based on the given context, the best answer to the question \\"Why did Sasha become Casey's friend after they met at camp?\\" would be B: get to know Casey. While options A and C might have played a role in Sasha's motivation to become friends with Casey, they do not inherently explain the reason behind forming a friendship. Option A: was lonely implies that Sasha sought friendship with Casey solely out of loneliness, but the context does not provide information to support this assumption. Option C: introduce herself to Casey merely suggests that Sasha wanted to get acquainted with Casey, but it does not necessarily signify the intention of forming a friendship. On the other hand, option B: get to know Casey effectively captures the essence of forming a friendship, as it implies a genuine interest in learning about Casey's personality, interests, and experiences to build a meaningful connection. This answer aligns with the notion that friendships often develop from shared experiences, such as attending camp together and taking part in various activities.

Given the question: Given the following context: Lennon played a mouth organ during a bus journey to visit his cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon that he could have a harmonica if he came to Edinburgh the following day; the harmonica had been stored in the Edinburgh bus depot after a passenger had inadvertently left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play the harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.As his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the Rickenbacker 325, Epiphone Casino and Gibson J-160E, and, from the start of his solo career, the Gibson Les Paul Junior. Double Fantasy producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings. Occasionally he played a six-string bass guitar, the Fender Bass VI, providing bass on some Beatles numbers (\\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", \\"Helter Skelter\\") that occupied McCartney with another instrument. His other instrument of choice was the piano, on which he composed many songs, including \\"Imagine\\", described as his best-known solo work. His jamming on a piano with McCartney in 1963 led to the creation of the Beatles' first US number one, \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\". In 1964, he became one of the first British musicians to acquire a Mellotron keyboard, though it was not heard on a Beatles recording until \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" in 1967. answer the following question: What is the name of the song that is considered Lennon's best known solo work?

A:","completion":"When Wendy increases the frequency of her radio's sound waves, these waves now have more energy. This is based on the assumption provided that higher frequency waves have greater energy. In general, the energy of a wave is directly proportional to its frequency. Higher frequency waves, such as ultraviolet and gamma radiation, have more energy, while lower frequency waves, such as radio and microwave radiation, have less energy. The relationship between the energy (E) of a wave and its frequency (f) can be described by the equation: E = h √ó f where \\"h\\" represents the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), \\"f\\" is the frequency of the wave, and \\"E\\" is the energy of the wave.

Instead, the answer should provide specific information regarding the construction date and background of the Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue located in the Marais district of Paris. A more appropriate answer would be: The Marais-quarter Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue, also known as the Pavee Synagogue, was built in 1913-1914. It is situated at 10 rue Pav√©e in the heart of the Marais district, a historic Jewish quarter in Paris. Designed by the architect Hector Guimard, a well-known figure of the Art Nouveau style, the synagogue has a unique facade that makes it stand out in the neighborhood. In addition to its architectural significance, the Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue played an important role in the spiritual and communal lives of Parisian Jews, especially those of Eastern European origin, during the 20th century. The construction of the Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue coincided with a period of increased immigration of Eastern European Jews to France, resulting in a growing Jewish community within the Marais district. This surge in the Jewish population led to the need for a larger and more modern synagogue in the area, and the Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue was built to serve this purpose. Although the history of Jewish presence in the Marais extends back to the Middle Ages, the construction of this specific synagogue is a much more recent development in the area's rich Jewish history. In addition to hosting religious services, the Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue has also served as a center for community events, educational activities, and cultural celebrations throughout its history. During World War II, the synagogue, like many other Jewish institutions in Paris, suffered damage from Nazi occupation forces. However, it was later restored and preserved as a symbol of the resilience and continuity of the Parisian Jewish community. In summary, the Marais-quarter Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue was built in 1913-1914, during an era of significant Jewish immigration to Paris from Eastern Europe. The synagogue remains a living testament to the vibrant Jewish history and community of the Marais district."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

An English teacher introduced him to George Bernard Shaw which resulted in an interest in polemic. He ended school during 1963 at age 18; he worked at various times as a groom (for the Atherstone Hunt), a student teacher (1963-65), and a clerk for the Royal Masonic Charity Institute, London (1966). His hobbies included electric guitars and writing pastiches of H. H. Munro. His first short story was published during 1966 by Kyril Bonfiglioli at Science Fantasy magazine, on the strength of which he relocated to London. He there met Michael Moorcock, who was editing New Worlds magazine. He began writing reviews and short fiction for New Worlds, and by 1968 he was appointed books editor.

Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine.

Because ticks are a type of arachnid, like spiders and scorpions, they have 8 legs. If your bug has 6, it is an insect and therefore not a tick. If your bug has less than 6 or more than 8 legs, it is neither an insect nor arachnid but is, regardless, not a tick. Billbugs are the commonly mistaken for ticks because of their near-identical appearance. The way to distinguish between a tick and a billbug is to watch them. Billbugs swarm in groups, whereas ticks are usually alone. Ticks also feed on blood, whereas billbugs do not. As a general rule, billbugs do not hang around or on people and animals. Ticks often do. Both ticks and bed bugs hang around animals and humans. Their method of feeding off of people and animals, however, differs. Ticks burrow into the skin to drink a living creature's blood but bed bugs stay on the skin's surface. Make sure you know whether a bug is a tick or bed bug before removing it from your skin.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: General Sir Miles Christopher Dempsey, (15 December 1896 - 5 June 1969) was a senior British Army officer who served in both world wars. As a junior officer, he fought in France during the First World War, where he was wounded, and served throughout the difficult interwar period, travelling to various corners of the globe. During the Second World War he had a close relationship with Bernard Montgomery and commanded the 13th Brigade in France in 1940, and spent the next two years training troops in England, before commanding XIII Corps for the invasions of Sicily and Italy in 1943. He later commanded the Second Army during the Battle of Normandy and made rapid advances in the subsequent campaign in Northern France and Belgium and was the first British Army commander to cross the Rhine. In North Africa, Sicily and Italy, Montgomery's faith in Dempsey had proved justified and he had also gained a reputation for his expertise in Combined Operations. This prompted Montgomery, when he left Italy at the end of 1943 to take command of the 21st Army Group for the forthcoming D-Day landings, to select Dempsey to command the British Second Army. The Second Army was the main British force (although it also included Canadian Army units) involved in the landings, making successful assaults at Gold, Juno and Sword beaches on 6 June 1944. The successful assaults were followed by a battle of attrition during which the Anglo-Canadian forces were frustrated by determined German resistance. This fighting drew vital German units including the bulk of their armoured strength to the Caen sector, facilitating the breakout further west in July (see Operation Cobra) by Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. Third Army. The Second Army then made a rapid advance across northern France into Belgium, liberating Brussels and Antwerp in September 1944. On 15 October 1944, during a visit to the Second Army, King George VI knighted Dempsey on the battlefield. Because of the fast and successful advance over more than 200 miles in a week Dempsey received the nickname of \\"Two Hundred Miles\\" Dempsey. Second Army's XXX Corps (now commanded by Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks) took part in Operation Market Garden, the failed attempt to secure an early crossing of the River Rhine in September 1944, which Dempsey believed could not succeed and openly questioned to Montgomery. Airborne troops secured a succession of canal and river crossings to enable XXX Corps to reach the Lower Rhine at Arnhem and wheel right into Germany. Intelligence had not detected the presence of unexpected German formations in the area and resistance proved greater than expected frustrating XXX Corps attempts to reach its final objective. During the operation, Dempsey, forward near the front with his Tac HQ, witnessed the crossing of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division's 504th Parachute Regiment cross the Nijmegen bridge. Impressed, he later wrote that the 82nd was \\"easily the best division on the Western front\\". Dempsey met with the 82nd's commander, Brigadier General James M. Gavin, shook him by the hand and said \\"I am proud to meet the commander of the greatest division in the world today.\\" The Second Army, with XII and XXX Corps in the vanguard and II Canadian Corps under command and VIII Corps in reserve eventually crossed the Rhine on 23 March 1945, and Dempsey was the first British Army commander to do so. On 7 April 1945, The Illustrated London News carried a full front page of a specially commissioned portrait painting of Dempsey by artist Arthur Pan. In May, Dempsey's men captured Bremen, Hamburg and Kiel. At 11.00 am on 3 May, a delegation of senior German officers led by General Admiral von Friedeberg arrived at Dempsey's Tac HQ and after questioning it appeared that Friedeberg was a representative of Generalfeldmarschall Keitel and Grand Admiral Donitz who wished to surrender. In typical fashion Dempsey sent them on their way to report to Montgomery which led to the formal surrender the next day at Luneberg Heath. what happened in 1944?","completion":"In 1944, General Sir Miles Christopher Dempsey commanded the British Second Army during the D-Day landings.

Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864‚Äì1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, n√©e Ribeyrol (1870‚Äì1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the premi√®re of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents.

This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women‚Äôs lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) ‚Äì a weighty force in UK academia ‚Äì the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants.

So, let's add 14701 to both sides: (-241 * m) - 14701 + 14701 = 0 + 14701 -241 * m = 14701 Now, to find out the value of 1 m candy, we need to divide by -241: m = 14701 / -241 And when we do the division, we get: m = -61 So, our hidden treasure tells us that m is equal to -61!

Refine paper stock. Options: [A]. different meanings. [B]. the same meaning.","completion":"[B]. the same meaning. The word \\"refine\\" used in both of these sentences shares the same basic meaning, which is to purify or improve something by removing unwanted elements or impurities. However, the context and the process involved with refining oil and refining paper stock are different. In the first sentence, \\"Refine oil\\", the term \\"refine\\" refers to the process of purification and improvement of crude oil. The crude oil is usually extracted from the ground and it contains various impurities such as water, salts, and other mineral particles. In order to make crude oil suitable for various industrial uses, like producing gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel, it must go through several physical and chemical processes to remove these impurities and separate the various components that make up crude oil. This process of purification is called oil refining. The refined oil becomes more valuable and useful as a result of this process. Example: Oil refineries take crude oil and refine it into various petroleum products such as gasoline and lubricants. In the second sentence, \\"Refine paper stock\\", the term \\"refine\\" is used to describe the process of improving the quality of paper pulp or paper stock. In the papermaking process, raw materials such as wood fibers, water, and chemicals are combined to create a mixture called paper pulp or paper stock. This stock contains impurities and inconsistencies, which can have a direct impact on the final quality of the paper produced. By refining the paper stock, paper manufacturers remove impurities, improve the quality of the fibers, and enhance the characteristics of the final paper, such as its smoothness, strength, and brightness. Example: Paper mills refine the paper stock to ensure a high-quality end product with a smooth finish and consistent appearance. In summary, the word \\"refine\\" shares the same basic meaning in both sentences - to purify or improve a substance by removing unwanted elements or impurities.

Many haikus are inspired by objects in the natural world, such as trees, rocks, mountains, and flowers. To get ideas for your poem, take a walk in a park nearby or go for a hike in the woods. Sentence: haiku poem is inspired by flora fauna Options are: 1). Yes 2). It's impossible to say 3). No","completion":"1). Yes The text explicitly states that many haikus are inspired by objects in the natural world, which includes various elements of flora and fauna such as trees, rocks, mountains, and flowers. Taking a walk in nature or going for a hike in the woods can provide ideas for a haiku poem, further reinforcing the deep connection between haiku poetry and the natural world. Flora refers to plant life, whereas fauna refers to animal life. Although the examples mentioned in the text focus primarily on flora (trees and flowers), the overarching theme of inspiration drawn from nature suggests that fauna would also be a source of inspiration for haiku poems. In a broader context, the essence of haiku is capturing the beauty and simplicity of the natural world, often in the form of its most transient and fleeting moments. This poetic form, which originated in Japan, is known for its concise structure consisting of 17 syllables, arranged in three lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllables each. The purpose of a haiku is to evoke a specific image, emotion, or moment in time, often with references to seasonal changes and the cyclical patterns of life. Given that the natural world is an intrinsic part of haiku poetry, it is evident that these poems are inspired by both flora and fauna. Distinctive elements of plants and animals can be skillfully woven into a haiku to provide a snapshot of nature's beauty and diversity. Sometimes, haiku poets may use the interaction between flora and fauna as a subject matter, for instance, depicting a bird perched on a tree branch or a caterpillar crawling on a leaf. In conclusion, the sentence \\"haiku poem is inspired by flora and fauna\\" is true, as the text states that many haiku poems draw inspiration from elements of the natural world, encompassing both flora and fauna. This inspiration is integral to the very essence of haiku poetry, which seeks to capture snapshots of nature's beauty in its simplest and most transient forms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - decision - enlightenment - new thoughts - headaches - annurism Explain why a human would choose \\"decision\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"decision\\" as the answer to the question above because of the context provided by the term \\"cogitating\\" and the nature of the situation being described. Cogitating refers to the act of thinking deeply or carefully about something, often with an intention to better understand or solve a given problem. In this context, it is clear that Billy is trying to assess the situation and evaluate different options or outcomes. This most logically leads to the notion that he would have to make a decision as a consequence of his cogitation. While other options like enlightenment, new thoughts, headaches, and an aneurysm may be possible outcomes in different scenarios, they are not directly linked to cogitating a situation in the same way that making a decision is. Here's a brief explanation for each of the other options: - Enlightenment implies a level of spiritual or intellectual realization, which is not necessarily the direct outcome of cogitating a situation. - New thoughts may emerge from cogitating, but it doesn't specifically indicate that a decision or definitive action will result. - Headaches can be a consequence of overthinking or stressing about a situation, but they don't imply a decision or conclusive response to the problem. - An aneurysm is a serious medical condition involving a blood vessel in the brain, and while stress or mental strain might increase the risk for it, it is not a predictable or expected outcome of cogitating.

Sgt. Demetrick Pennie, president of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation and a 17-year law enforcement veteran, filed the amended complaint in federal court Friday. Conservative news site Breitbart published the lawsuit in an article that evening. The listed defendants include not only those associated with the Black Lives Matter movement but public figures such as the Rev. Al Sharpton, Louis Farrahkan, George Soros, the New Black Panthers Party and even President Barack Obama and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. According to the suit, the defendants \\"have repeatedly incited their supporters and others to engage in threats of and attacks to cause serious bodily injury or death upon police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicities.\\" The suit accuses the defendants of inciting supporters and others \\"to engage in threats and attacks\\" against law enforcement officers around the country, including the July 7 murders of five Dallas officers by Micah Johnson after a Black Lives Matter demonstration. Pennie is being represented by Larry Klayman of lobbying organization FreedomWatch. \\"Sergeant Pennie and I feel duty-bound to put ourselves forward to seek an end to the incitement of violence against law enforcement which has already resulted in the death of five police officers in Dallas and the wounding of seven more, just in Texas alone,\\" Breitbart quoted Klayman as saying in a release. The 66-page complaint seeks damages of more than 500 million. A Dallas Morning News editorial in July commended Pennie for inviting Cleveland Browns football star Isaiah Crowell to attend the funeral of one of the slain Dallas officers after Crowell briefly posted an anti-police image on social media in anger over the deaths of African-Americans in police-involved shootings nationwide.

Other assaults and deaths have occurred elsewhere.

Because of the longer intervals between points changes and the long life the cost per hectare is lower with Marathon points than with standard points Add punctuation.","completion":"Because of the longer intervals between points changes, and the long life, the cost per hectare is lower with Marathon points than with standard points. Analyzing this statement, we can identify a few key factors that contribute to the cost-effectiveness of Marathon points over standard points. These factors can help us better understand why Marathon points are viewed as more economical in the long run. First, let's examine the intervals between points changes. Marathon points exhibit longer intervals, which means that they require less frequent replacements or adjustments. Consequently, this leads to reduced labor and maintenance costs, as the equipment can continue to function at optimal levels for extended periods without requiring intervention. Second, the long life of Marathon points is another contributing factor to their cost-effectiveness. As these points are built to last and are resistant to wear and tear, they offer financial savings in terms of replacement costs. Standard points, on the other hand, may deteriorate more quickly, necessitating more frequent replacements, leading to a comparatively higher cost per hectare. Therefore, taking these factors into account, Marathon points prove to be a more cost-effective solution over their standard counterparts. The longer intervals between points changes and the extended lifespan of Marathon points result in a decreased cost per hectare and offer significant savings in both maintenance and replacement costs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (born Lawrence Joshua Chamberlain, September 8, 1828 - February 24, 1914) was an American college professor from the State of Maine, who volunteered during the American Civil War to join the Union Army. He became a highly respected and decorated Union officer, reaching the rank of brigadier general (and brevet major general). He is best known for his gallantry at the Battle of Gettysburg, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Chamberlain was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862 and fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Chamberlain became most famous for his achievements during the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 2, the second day of the battle, Union forces were recovering from initial setbacks and hastily regrouping into defensive positions on a line of hills south of the town. Sensing the momentary vulnerability of the Union forces, the Confederates began an attack against the Union left flank. Chamberlain's brigade, commanded by Col. Strong Vincent, was sent to defend Little Round Top by the army's Chief of Engineers, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren. Chamberlain found himself and the 20th Maine at the far left end of the entire Union line. He quickly understood the strategic significance of the small hill, and the need for the 20th Maine to hold the Union left at all costs. The men from Maine waited until troops from the 15th Regiment Alabama Infantry, commanded by Col. William C. Oates, charged up the hill, attempting to flank the Union position. Time and time again the Confederates struck, until the 20th Maine was almost doubled back upon itself. With many casualties and ammunition running low, Col. Chamberlain recognized the dire circumstances and ordered his left wing (which was now looking southeast, compared to the rest of the regiment, which was facing west) to initiate a bayonet charge. From his report of the day: \\"At that crisis, I ordered the bayonet. The word was enough.\\" While battlefield conditions make it unlikely that many men heard Chamberlain's order, most historians believe he initiated the charge. The 20th Maine charged down the hill, with the left wing wheeling continually to make the charging line swing like a hinge, thus creating a simultaneous frontal assault and flanking maneuver, capturing 101 of the Confederate soldiers and successfully saving the flank. This version of the battle was popularized by the book The Killer Angels and the movie Gettysburg, but there is debate on the historical validity of this account. Chamberlain sustained two slight wounds in the battle, one when a shot hit his sword scabbard and bruised his thigh, and another when his right foot was hit by a spent bullet or piece of shrapnel. Chamberlain also personally took a Confederate prisoner with his saber during the charge. After initiating the maneuver, he came upon a Confederate Officer wielding a revolver who quickly fired, narrowly missing his face. Chamberlain remained steadfast, and with his sword at the officer's throat accepted the man's arms and surrender. The pistol Chamberlain captured at Gettysburg can still be seen on display in the Civil War exhibit of the Maine State Museum. For his tenacity at defending Little Round Top, he was known by the sobriquet Lion of the Round Top. Prior to the battle, Chamberlain was quite ill, developing malaria and dysentery. Later, due to this illness, he was taken off active duty until he recovered. For his \\"daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and carrying the advance position on the Great Round Top\\", Chamberlain was awarded the Medal of Honor.

Most of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth comes from the sun. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves are characterized by certain wavelengths and wave frequencies. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy. Now, I have a new situation: David is experimenting with electromagnetic waves. He has four different waves to study, wave A, wave B, wave C, and wave D. In wave A, distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves is greater than that of wave B. In wave C, the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given time is greater than that of wave D. Answer this question please: Which wave has higher frequency, wave A or wave B?

The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636‚Äì1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \\"Best Bed Chamber\\".

How do I start eating non veg? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"No, those questions do not have the same meaning. The first question pertains to Swami Vivekananda's choice of consuming non-vegetarian food despite Bhagavad Gita's classification of it as Tamasic food, while the second question seeks guidance on how to begin consuming non-vegetarian food. Let us address each question individually to provide a detailed response. 1. Why did Swami Vivekananda eat non-vegetarian food when it is classified as Tamasic food in Bhagavad Gita? Swami Vivekananda (1863‚Äì1902) was a prominent figure in India's spiritual and philosophical landscape. He was a disciple of the renowned mystic Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and carried forward his guru's teachings. Vivekananda became well-known for his oratory skills and ability to convey complex philosophies to people of different backgrounds and cultures. It is essential to understand Swami Vivekananda's larger context before delving into his specific dietary preferences. Born and raised in Bengal under a colonial milieu, Vivekananda grew up amidst a blend of traditional Indian values and modern Western influences. He strongly believed in the need for India to make progress in science, technology, and overall development. These ideals shaped his views on various topics, such as education, social reform, and spirituality. Regarding food habits, the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Hindu scripture, classifies food into three categories: Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic. According to this classification, Tamasic foods are considered to generate ignorance, inertia, and dullness. Non-vegetarian food falls under Tamasic food in this context. Swami Vivekananda was not dogmatic about food habits and believed that food choices should be driven by individual needs and environmental factors. His focus was on practicality, and he dealt with issues in a realistic manner. The reason for consuming non-vegetarian food, despite knowing its classification as Tamasic, may stem from the belief that there are more pressing issues to address in order to uplift the human condition. It is also worth mentioning that India has diverse cultural and religious practices, along with regional variations in dietary habits. Swami Vivekananda aimed to promote unity among these diverse groups, and his embrace of various food traditions could have been an attempt to foster understanding and empathy among people. 2. How do I start eating non-vegetarian food? If you would like to start eating non-vegetarian food, there are certain steps you can follow to make the transition in a gradual and healthy manner: a. Reflect on your reasons: Start by understanding your motivation for including non-vegetarian food in your diet. It could be for health reasons, variety, social reasons, or personal preference. b. Educate yourself: Learn about the different types of non-vegetarian food and the nutrients they provide. Look up recipes, cooking processes, and techniques to help you understand how to prepare and consume these foods properly. c. Start with the basics: Begin with simple, familiar meals that may already be a part of your cultural or regional food practices. For instance, if you come from a predominantly fish-eating community, start by trying fish before moving on to other meats. d. Gradual transition: Avoid making drastic changes to your diet overnight. Transition gradually by incorporating smaller portions of non-vegetarian food into your meals and observing how your body responds to the change. e. Source ethically and practice moderation: Be mindful of the sources of your non-vegetarian food, choosing ethically raised and sustainable options whenever possible. Remember, moderation is key ‚Äì maintain a balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes along with non-vegetarian options. f. Consult a professional: If you have concerns or health issues, consult a registered dietitian, nutritionist, or healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet. In conclusion, while Swami Vivekananda's personal choice to consume non-vegetarian food despite its classification as Tamasic food in Bhagavad Gita may be seen as controversial, his broader perspective and practical approach to life can offer valuable insights. On the other hand, if you wish to include non-vegetarian food in your diet, take a mindful, gradual, and well-informed approach to ensure a healthy transition. The two questions, while related, bear distinct meanings and require separate analyses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

We have two groups of things: 1. 40 * q and 31 * q 2. -137 and -5 We're trying to find the value of 'q', the unknown number. First, let's deal with the two groups on the left side (40 * q and 31 * q). They are both multiplied by q, so we can add them together. 40 * q + 31 * q = (40 + 31) * q = 71 * q Now our equation looks like this: 71 * q = -137 - 5 Next, let's solve the group on the right side (-137 and -5). They're both negative numbers, and when we add them together, they become a bigger negative number: -137 - 5 = -142 Now our equation looks like this: 71 * q = -142 To find the value of 'q', we need to get rid of the 71 that's multiplying it. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 71: (71 * q) / 71 = -142 / 71 Since 71 / 71 is equal to 1, the left side becomes: 1 * q = -142 / 71 Now, when we divide -142 by 71, we get: q = -2 So, the value of 'q' we were looking for is -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.Jos√© de Sig√ºenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome.

A desperate Leah Fuller hires the three men and local Vicente Madariaga, to rescue her husband, John, who is pinned under debris from a gold mine cave-in in hostile Apache territory. During the harrowing journey, Luke tries to force himself on Leah late one night, forcing Hooker to intervene. Leah tells Hooker that where her husband is trapped, once was a boom town, but a volcano eruption wiped it out, leaving only a church steeple and the mine uncovered by lava. The resident priest called it the \\"garden of evil\\". The Indians now consider the volcano sacred. The group then arrives at the mine. They find John unconscious, and they free him. Before John wakes up, Hooker sets the man's broken leg. When John regains consciousness, he accuses Leah of using him to get gold. Hooker talks to Leah later, about what her husband said; after he tells her that he has spotted signs of Apaches nearby, she offers him and the others all the gold they have dug up to take her husband away that night, while she remains behind to make it look like they are all still there.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance? Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 ‚Äì late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht D√ºrer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Speeches don't have to be invented from scratch. Telling a personal story is a great way to come up with something quickly: since you already know what happened, you'll know what to say. For example: At a wedding, you could tell a funny story about growing up with the bride or groom. At a funeral, you could tell a story about how kind or generous the deceased was, or about how they influenced you. This is another way to rely on something that's already out there, rather than having to come up with something on the spot. Think of an inspiring quotation, some lyrics to a song, or a famous saying that applies to the situation when you're speaking. Start off with that, and then discuss it a bit. For example, imagine you're giving a toast at Frank's 70th birthday. You could say something like: ‚ÄúThey say you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Frank here's proving them wrong. Who else would have the courage to start running marathons in retirement?‚Äù Rambling on too long is the number one thing that can go wrong when giving a personal speech. It's much better to avoid saying too much. Keep your speech brief, focusing on two to five main points or examples. For example, if you're toasting the groom at a wedding, stick to just two good stories about your friendship. If you see people in the audience do things like turn away, talk to each other, check their phones or watches, or fidget in their seats, you might be rambling on and losing their attention. If this happens just quickly cut to your main point and say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù as a way to close. Even practiced speakers can get nervous when asked to give a talk on the spot. Control your nerves by taking a deep breath before you begin, and taking brief pauses every so often while you are talking. Focus on pronouncing your words clearly, and not speaking too quickly. Many people feel nervous about giving a speech, especially with little notice. But if you show the confidence to give one, they'll applaud you. Plus, they'll all be so happy not to be the ones giving the speech that they'll probably be super supportive! Simple ways to find your confidence before giving a speech include taking some deep, slow breaths, or closing your eyes and visualising a happy place before you begin. You can also look out in the audience and find a few friends or people who seem supportive, and focus on them. If you're nervous, you could also try the old standby of imagining everyone in the audience naked! Above all, just remind yourself that most people will naturally admire the courage of someone who shows the confidence to get up and speak in front of a crowd. Summary:","completion":"The article suggests effective speech making tips, such as telling personal stories or using famous quotes, keeping it short and focused, controlling nerves through deep breaths and clear pronunciation, and building confidence by visualizing a supportive audience or a happy place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation? In decorative and fruit gardens this is certainly not desirable since correctly formed trees are essential either for aesthetic reasons or for the fruit yield","completion":"\\"In decorative and fruit gardens, this is certainly not desirable, since correctly formed trees are essential, either for aesthetic reasons or for the fruit yield.\\" Justification of punctuation: 1. After \\"In decorative and fruit gardens\\": I put a comma here because the phrase \\"In decorative and fruit gardens\\" is an introductory clause, which sets the context for the main clause that follows. According to general grammar rules, it's usual to use a comma after an introductory word, phrase or clause. 2. After \\"not desirable\\": The comma after \\"not desirable\\" is used to separate the main clause \\"this is certainly not desirable\\" from the subordinate (dependent) clause \\"since correctly formed trees are essential\\". This helps in making the sentence more clear and easy to understand. 3. After \\"essential\\": This comma is used to separate two independent clauses \\"correctly formed trees are essential\\" and \\"either for aesthetic reasons or for the fruit yield\\". These two thoughts could work as two separate sentences hence, they are independent clauses but since they are closely related they can be separated by comma."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which south eastern suburb in Adelaide, South Australia provided the bricks to build the Old Government House in Belair National Park?","completion":"The suburb that provided the bricks to build the Old Government House in Belair National Park, located in Adelaide, South Australia, is Blackwood. Blackwood is situated in the Adelaide Hills region and is part of the south-eastern suburbs of Adelaide. The Old Government House, built in 1860, was originally conceived as a summer residence for the Governor of South Australia. It is an outstanding example of early colonial architecture in South Australia and is an important historical site. The bricks for the construction of the house were sourced from Mitcham clay deposits, which were abundant in the nearby Blackwood area. During the 19th century, the Adelaide Hills region was home to several brickmaking sites, with the clay deposits in the Blackwood area providing high-quality materials for building purposes. Brick-making was a vital part of the region's economy at that time, and Blackwood's contribution to the construction of prestigious buildings like the Old Government House is a testament to the quality of its clay and brick workforce. Over time, many structures in the region have been built using Blackwood bricks, leaving a lasting legacy for the suburb and its historical importance in the Adelaide Hills region. Today, the Old Government House stands inside the Belair National Park as a testament to the craftsmanship of the brickmakers from Blackwood and plays a crucial role in preserving the history and heritage of the area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Underworld Movie plot: Background: 1,400 years ago, Vampires had decided that the best way to ensure the survival of their species was for three Elders--Viktor, Marcus, and Amelia--to 'leap frog' through time, one ruling while the other two slept, each being awakened at their appointed time according to a never-to-be-broken covenant. 1,000 years ago, during the reign of Viktor, the oldest and strongest of the Elders, the Vampire-Lycan War began. 600 years ago, Kraven set the 'great blaze' which killed Lucian, the leader of the Lycans. Kraven brought back a brand cut from Lucian's arm as proof of his death, a deed which earned Kraven high favor with Viktor, who put Kraven in charge of their coven. The great blaze caused the Lycans to scatter. Vampire Death Dealers, armed with silver bullets and shuriken, have been picking Lycans off one by one until very few remain.Present time: Three Death Dealers--Selene, Rigel, and Nathaniel -- follow two Lycans into a subway station in an unnamed European city. A firey gun battle ensues in which Rigel is killed, one of the Lycans gets away, and Nathaniel comes up missing. In the chaos, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) makes two discoveries: 1) the Lycans have devised an ultraviolet bullet that can kill vampires, and 2) there appears to be a large band of Lycans amassing under the subway.Selene hurries back to alert the Vampires at Kraven's luxurious masnion that sits on the outskirts of the city, but they are more interested in the clothes they are going to wear at tonight's formal party with the coven from across the 'great ocean' in celebration of the upcoming awakening of Marcus by Amelia, the current reigning Elder. Not interested in their gaities, Selene views some digital photos Rigel took of the Lycans and notices that they appear to have been following a human.

After the failure of the coup in Kaunas, there were numerous small border incidents. On September 19, 1919, Polish troops attacked Gelvonai and encroached towards Ukmergƒó. On several occasions fights broke out regarding strategically important bridge over the ≈†ventoji River near Vepriai. In October, when main Lithuanian forces were deployed against the Bermontians in northwestern Lithuania, the attacks intensified. Poles captured Salakas on October 5 and attacked Kapƒçiamiestis on October 12. The front stabilized, but harassment of border guards and local villagers continued throughout late 1919 and early 1920. In March 1920, the Poles attacked along the railroad stations in Kalk≈´ni and Turmantas. The situation was investigated by British and French observers and reported to the Entente. The situation somewhat improved only in late spring 1920 when most Polish troops were deployed in Ukraine during the Polish-Soviet War. At the time Lithuania faced a severe budget crisis - in 1919 its revenue was 72 million while expenses reached 190 million German marks. While the government was struggling to obtain financial assistance and loans, deep cuts affected the army.

Answer based on context: But its success depended greatly on the use of Portuguese mercenaries who proved unreliable and troublesome. Arakan lost the port city of Syriam in Lower Burma in 1603 when its Portuguese governor Filipe de Brito e Nicote declared that he was now loyal to the Portuguese viceroy of Goa. After two failed expeditions by the Arakanese navy to retake the port in 1604 and 1605, Arakan gave up its claims on the Lower Burma coastline. Arakan's Portuguese troubles were not yet over. In 1609, its northern territories at the edge of Ganges delta and off Chittagong came under threat by the Portuguese mercenaries and the Mughal government in Bengal. In March 1609, 400 Portuguese mercenaries, led by Sebastian Gonzales Tibao, seized the Sandwip island. Meanwhile, the Mughal governor of Bengal tried to take over Noakhali District. Min Yazagyi was forced to enter into an alliance with the Portuguese to drive out the Mughals. After the Mughals were driven out, Gonzales promptly seized the Arakanese navy, and began raiding as far south as Lemro river. Later, the Portuguese viceroy at Goa sanctioned an attack on Mrauk-U itself. In November 1615, a fleet of 14 Portuguese galliots and 50 smaller war boats led by Francis de Meneses sailed up the Lemro. Alas, the fleet was driven back by Arakanese defences, which included broadsides of a few Dutch ships. Two years later, King Min Khamaung finally captured Sandwip, and put most of its inhabitants to death.
