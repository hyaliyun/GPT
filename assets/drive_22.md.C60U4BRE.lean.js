In the study, women who were new mothers scored better on tests of visuospatial memory - the ability to understand and remember information about their surroundings--compared with women who didn't have children. The findings contradicts the old belief that women develop\\"baby brain\\" or a decline in memory and cognitive function, after they have kids, said study researcher Melissa Santiago, a doctoral student at Carlos Albizu University in Miami. \\"You don't have to feel that because you have kids, your memory isn't the same,\\" Santiago said. The study was small, and the findings will have to be tested in larger groups of people, Santiago said. Previous studies on the topic have had mixed results--some showed motherhood hurts cognition, and others showed the opposite. Studies on rats show those with pups have better memory than those without offspring. Santiago analyzed information from 35 first-time mothers whose children were ages 10 to 24 months, and 35 women who had never been pregnant. Both groups scored similarly on intelligence tests. The average age of mothers was 29 and the average age of never-pregnant women was 27. To test visuospatial memory, the women were shown a paper containing six symbols for 10 seconds, and then asked to draw what they remembered. This task was repeated several times. The first time women were shown the paper, both groups remembered about the same amount. But on the second and third pass, mothers performed better than those without children, indicating that the mothers collected more information each time than the other women. Later, the women were shown a variety of different symbols, and asked to remember which ones were presented on the earlier task. Mothers did not make a mistake in this task--they remembered every symbol correctly--but those without children made one or two errors, Santiago said. Which of the following was discussed in the text? A) Ways to test visuospatial memory. B) Why having kids improves memory. C) How young mothers are different from never-pregnant women.

The Juventus midfielder left Old Trafford in 2012 because of a lack of first-team opportunities, but he could become the centrepiece of Jose Mourinho's new-look United side. Pogba's talent has been evident for years. That was why United signed him from Le Havre in 2009, when he had already captained France's Under-16 team. He was the same lithe, energetic athlete he is today, if somewhat more gangly. What he has done, according to knowledgeable sources, is apply himself and work at his game. Now 23, he still has a tendency to float in and out of matches - he was not a consistent performer at Euro 2016 and did not appear to relish the deeper role he was given by coach Didier Deschamps when France lost to Portugal in the final. But he has developed a greater understanding of his game and, with that mental maturity, more awareness of his positional responsibilities to the team as a whole. In his first spell at United, he would be walked through specific situations to improve his game management, or be taken to senior matches and told to watch individual players rather than the game itself. This experience has been put to good use. Under 21 football in England may be derided, but occasional outings alongside senior players also helped his education. Pogba is not the finished article. But the promise United first identified seven years ago is showing positive signs of being fulfilled, more than enough to persuade the club to potentially pay such a massive fee. Pogba made three substitute appearances for Manchester United in the Premier League, before joining Juventus for the 2012-13 season. Pogba was brought to the club as a 16-year-old boy, deemed good enough to play a central role in an FA Youth Cup final triumph in 2011, but was allowed to leave for an overseas rival, before being bought back for a world record fee four years later. Was it a mistake of gargantuan proportions or the consequence of a couple of isolated events combining to produce a very expensive outcome? Sir Alex Ferguson wanted to keep Pogba in 2012. Still only 19 at the time, Pogba and his agent Mino Raiola were made a contract offer and rejected it, meaning that all Juventus had to pay was a compensation fee of £1.5m for the teenager. Raiola believed Pogba should have been in the first team and on first-team wages. Ferguson felt he was still too raw to feature on a regular basis. It can't have helped that Ferguson and Raiola were like \\"oil and water\\", in the Scot's own words. The pivotal decision came when Paul Scholes, at the age of 37, reversed his retirement decision in January 2012. Scholes played 21 times in that half-season - and a further 21 in the campaign that followed. United were denied the title by Sergio Aguero's injury-time goal for Manchester City against QPR on the final day in 2012. They won it in 2013 - after which Scholes retired for good - but have not challenged since. There is no way of knowing what would have happened if Scholes had stayed retired and Pogba had played those games instead. It is just as impossible to assess whether the young midfielder would have developed at the same rate in England as he has done at Juventus, with whom he has won four successive Serie A titles. And had he remained at United, would Pogba now be looking to leave - just as Cristiano Ronaldo did for Real Madrid as he entered his prime? One thing is for sure: ignoring a player you need, just because you had him once and let him go, would be cutting off your nose to spite your face. Media playback is not supported on this device It is tempting to say that if a club spend going on for £100m on a player, the system fits around him, not the other way around. Football is not quite so straightforward, though. Even the best players can struggle without a structure - or if they are played out of position. It is still a source of bewilderment to staff at United as to why Angel di Maria - their previous record signing at £59.7m - was used as a holding midfield player by former manager Louis van Gaal. Di Maria, it is worth remembering, began his Old Trafford career with three goals and three assists in his first five Premier League appearances from the offensive position he was so effective in for Real Madrid. Pogba is a rarity in the modern game in that he is capable of both attack and defence. He is quick, has stamina and can tackle. Though not a prolific scorer, his average of one goal every five games suggests he is an attacking threat. And while his average of one yellow card in every four games would put him under threat of suspension if repeated in England, he was not sent off last season. In short, he is the kind of player United have lacked since Roy Keane left in 2005 - without the red cards. Mourinho will surely stick him in the centre of his midfield and work from there. In his recent interview with the BBC, Mourinho said he did not understand why there was such uncertainty over Wayne Rooney, who was \\"the club captain, the players' captain and my captain\\". However, there are many reasons why there are doubts about Rooney's future role at United. Including transfer fees and wages over the respective periods of their contracts, Mourinho - when the Pogba deal is complete - has committed £250m on Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and the Frenchman. A front-line striker, a creative offensive player and a dominant midfielder are three of the four fundamentals Mourinho identified as needing urgent attention when he replaced Van Gaal. At various points in his United career, Rooney has filled all these roles. In noting United's deficiencies and by addressing them in such a calculated manner, it is a fair assumption Mourinho intends to utilise his new additions, particularly in the biggest games. Rooney, for all his many attributes, is no speed merchant. Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Memphis Depay definitely are, making them better suited to wide positions. If the plan is to play Mkhitaryan wide, or deeper, in midfield, there is an obvious space for Rooney at number 10. But is that going to get the best from the Armenian? Mourinho likes his central midfield to contain aggressive, athletic players, such as Claude Makelele and Michael Essien from his first stint at Chelsea. Pogba is in that mould. Morgan Schneiderlin and Daley Blind could work effectively alongside him. If that happens, the uncertainty over Rooney will persist. Media playback is not supported on this device The manager who says he is truly happy with his squad, that he has the best player possible for any position and could not countenance spending a little bit more, has not been invented yet. Mourinho himself has said he would act \\"if something presents itself before 31 August\\". What it is safe to say is that he won't be spending any more money without recouping some. Even accounting for the demands of six pre-Christmas games in the Europa League, United's squad is too bulky as it is. Yet standards at Old Trafford have slipped so much since Ferguson's departure three years ago that it is hard to argue the issues have been rectified completely by Mourinho's four \\"fundamental\\" signings, which go straight through the spine of his team. For instance, 12 months ago, United were engaged in a concerted attempt to get central defender Sergio Ramos out of Real Madrid. It did not happen and Van Gaal did not recruit anyone else. In 23-year-old Ivory Coast defender Eric Bailly, who has played only 40 La Liga games, have United really strengthened their defence to Mourinho's satisfaction? So who might go to create space? German World Cup winner Bastian Schweinsteiger and Belgian wide man Adnan Januzaj evidently have no future at Old Trafford. The same is also true of Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair, two of the youngsters Van Gaal took pride in promoting. Of the 23 outfield players Mourinho is prepared to base United's season around, Marcos Rojo's alarming impetuosity identifies him as one potential candidate. Antonio Valencia continues to give the impression of being a winger trying to play full-back, rather than someone sure of his surroundings. Schneiderlin, Matteo Darmian and Depay were all massive disappointments in their first United campaigns. It is generally unwise to form concrete opinions on a single season, particularly on players coming to England for the first time - as it is solely on performances in a major tournament. Nevertheless, none of that trio can be sure of themselves. Ander Herrera is yet to show sustained form. And what of Juan Mata? The incredibly popular Spain midfielder, who United spent £37.1m on halfway through David Moyes' short tenure, was sold by Mourinho during his second spell at Chelsea. That the questions and doubts are so numerous come as a direct result of both United's fifth-place finish last season and the various awful performances that contributed to it. Until they wake from their post-Ferguson slumber, the forensic analysis of United and their players will go on.","completion":"Juventus midfielder, Paul Pogba, may become the centrepiece of Jose Mourinho's new Manchester United side if he returns to Old Trafford after leaving in 2012."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which language is this?","completion":"The text presented is in Finnish, a Finno-Ugric language primarily spoken in Finland and by minority groups in neighboring countries. Finnish is a complex language that has many unique attributes. For starters, it is part of the Finno-Ugric group of languages, which primarily exist in Finland, Hungary, and certain areas of Russia. Therefore, it has no direct linguistic roots with many other European languages. The language is defined by its particular use of inflections. For example, Finnish uses extensive modifiers to denote the role of a noun within a sentence, rather than relying on prepositions. This may make it seem quite complicated for non-Finnish speakers. However, like any language, it becomes easier to understand with practice. Finnish is also notable for its unique phonetic structure. It has double vowels and consonants, which are distinct sounds that should not be blended together, leading to a melodic quality. The tone or 'melody' of Finnish is a notable characteristic and it falls to the rhythm of trochaic tetrameter, which is popular in Finnish poetry. Another interesting point about Finnish is that it has no gender pronouns, and it uses the singular pronoun - 'hän' - to signify both 'he' and 'she'. This characteristic often leads those studying gender and language neutrality to cite Finnish as a prime example. The language used in legal, political or administrative matters, such as the extract you have provided, is a standardized form of Finnish known as \\"yleiskieli\\". This form is used uniformly across the country regardless of local dialects and it is taught in schools to maintain consistency in communications. Despite Finland's relatively small population, Finnish has a high rate of speakers, with about 90% of Finland's population considering it their first language. The rest of the population primarily speaks Swedish, which is Finland's second official language due to historical and political relationships between Finland and Sweden. In summary, the language of the text provided is Finnish - a unique and fascinating language characterized by complex inflections, unique phonetics, and a level of gender neutrality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After her mother was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, Julia Wilkerson lovingly cared for her. But after six years, the strain on the former county golf champion became too much – and she hit the 71-year-old over the head with a broom. It happened during an argument while they were clearing out the garage at their £250,000 detached, four-bedroom home. Sportswoman Julia Wilkerson, 40, lashed out after caring for her 71-year-old mother. The blow left Clover Wilkerson. bleeding and led to her daughter, a former team captain of the Norfolk. Ladies County Golf Association and five times winner of the Norfolk. county championships, facing prosecution for assault. The pair’s ‘loving relationship’ broke. down as Wilkerson, 40, struggled to cope under the immense strain of. being a carer, King’s Lynn magistrates’ court was told. She had fallen into a ‘cycle of. resentment and guilt’ and feared her life was no longer her own. Yvonne. Neil, prosecuting, said Wilkerson’s mother admitted slapping her. daughter on the back first during the argument in the garage. That led to Wilkerson hitting her mother with the broom, which was an ‘entirely disproportionate’ reaction, the lawyer added. Ian Graham, defending, said it was an ‘unfortunate case of two people who clearly love each other’. Wilkerson, a former team captain of Norfolk Ladies County Golf Association and five-time winner of Norfolk county championships, found herself hauled into court. ‘The relationship has got into. difficulty,’ he said. ‘Julia has siblings but she was the person who. decided to take on the very serious responsibility of becoming her. carer. It appears to have got too much for her.’ Mr Graham said Wilkerson was someone. with previous good character who had got into a ‘difficult situation’ with her mother but it was hoped the two would now be able to reconcile. their differences. Wilkerson, of King’s Lynn, Norfolk,. was given a 12-month conditional discharge after magistrates were given. character references showing her to be a ‘very caring person’. Presiding magistrate Jill Skinner said: ‘Both you and your mother are probably very upset by the whole thing.’ Wilkerson, who had denied a charge of. assault by beating at a previous hearing, was also ordered to pay £100. costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Police yesterday confirmed that. Wilkerson’s mother complained about her daughter on the day of the. attack, October 5 last year, which led to her arrest. Wilkerson was living with her mother at the time. Speaking at the house yesterday, her. mother said: ‘My daughter does not live here any more and it was part of. her bail conditions. ‘She works at a health centre but I. don’t want to make any further comment.’ Mrs Wilkerson lives a mile away. from her former husband Albert, who is remarried, and son Paul, 35. Neither was available to comment yesterday. Barbara Williams, director of research. and support charity Parkinson’s UK, said: ‘Parkinson’s is an incurable. condition that progresses over time, and caring for someone with. Parkinson’s can have a profound effect on mental and physical wellbeing. ‘It’s very common for carers to feel. stressed, fatigued and have difficulty sleeping but very often they. don’t prioritise their own care, missing doctor’s appointments and. putting off getting help. ‘Nonetheless they have the courage to keep going, and the support carers contribute is invaluable.’ She urged carers in need of support. themselves to contact the charity’s support workers and groups to ‘help. take the pressure out of the pressure cooker’.

Write an article based on this summary: – Authorities aren't giving up the search for 500 million in paintings stolen in one of the largest art thefts in US history. On Monday, the FBI searched the property of an 80-year-old mobster linked to the 1990 theft of 13 paintings—including three Rembrandts, a Vermeer, and a Manet—from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, reports the Boston Globe. A lawyer for Robert Gentile says agents searched in and around his home in Manchester, Conn., using metal detectors and dogs. At one point, they were seen digging within 10 feet of the house after removing siding and a vent pipe reportedly leading to an underground oil tank, per the Hartford Courant. But \\"they ain't gonna find nothing,\\" Gentile told his lawyer, adding he didn't steal the paintings, isn't hiding them, and has no idea where they are. Two previous searches of the property turned up nothing, though federal prosecutors say Gentile offered to sell two of the stolen paintings to an undercover FBI agent for 500,000 each in 2015, reports NBC Connecticut. He also offered to return the paintings in exchange for a lesser sentence for a friend and told at least three people that he had access to the art, prosecutors say. Agents don't believe Gentile actually took part in the theft—those two men are dead, according to the FBI—but the wife of a suspect told police that her husband gave Gentile two paintings before his death in 2004. Gentile is now serving a 2.5-year prison sentence for drug and gun charges after an arrest last year, per ABC News. The Gardner Museum, meanwhile, is offering 5 million for information leading to the recovery of the masterworks.

Monday witnessed the FBI searching the property of 80-year-old mobster Robert Gentile, who has been linked to the theft. Background on the Theft: 13 valuable paintings were stolen in the 1990 heist, with works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Manet among them. The loss to the art world and the museum has not been forgotten, and the authorities remain determined to recover the stolen masterpieces. The Gardner Museum is currently offering a 5 million reward for information that leads to the successful recovery of the paintings. FBI searches Gentile's Property: With information on possible links between the notorious theft and mobster Robert Gentile, the FBI conducted a search of Gentile's home in Manchester, Connecticut. According to the Boston Globe, agents used metal detectors and dogs to scour the area, at one point digging within 10 feet of the house after removing siding and a vent pipe that led to an underground oil tank, as reported by the Hartford Courant. Gentile's Denial: Despite two previous unsuccessful searches of the property, Gentile's lawyer states that his client denies stealing the paintings, hiding them, or even knowing where they are. Gentile told his lawyer, \\"they ain't gonna find nothing.\\" Prior Incidents: However, federal prosecutors have revealed that Gentile attempted to sell two of the stolen paintings for 500,000 each to an undercover FBI agent in 2015, as reported by NBC Connecticut. Furthermore, Gentile reportedly offered to return the paintings if a friend's sentence could be reduced, and claimed to have access to the stolen artwork in conversations with at least three people. Current Situation: Although the FBI does not believe Gentile personally participated in the theft, the wife of a suspect told police that her husband gave Gentile two paintings before he died in 2004. Gentile is currently serving a 2.5-year prison sentence for unrelated drug and gun charges after being arrested last year, according to ABC News. Conclusion: Despite authorities not giving up on the search for the stolen artwork, and with the Gardner Museum offering a substantial reward, there is still no resolution to the case. The FBI's ongoing investigation of Robert Gentile's property demonstrates their continued efforts to locate and recover the missing masterpieces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"Scraping oneself on an object that is what, may cause an invasion of the body by bacteria?\\" and the following answer choices: - unknown - safe - threatened - harmful substances - Pollution - foreign - barrel-shaped - contaminated Now knowing that scraping oneself on a contaminated object may cause infection and an infection is an invasion of the body by bacteria, choose the best answer. Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"Scraping oneself on an object that is what, may cause an invasion of the body by bacteria?\\" given the options provided, is \\"contaminated\\". This selection is the most accurate and fitting response given the context and provided knowledge that scraping oneself on a contaminated object may cause an infection, and an infection is, in essence, an invasion of the body by bacteria. To understand why 'contaminated' is the best choice, let's delve into each option: - 'Unknown': This doesn't convey enough information about the object's state that would cause a bacterial invasion following a scrape. - 'Safe': This would imply the object is harmless, which contradicts with causing a bacterial invasion. - 'Threatened': This characterizes the object as being in danger, but does not suggest it could bring harm to a person who scrapes against it. - 'Harmful substances': While this option implies danger, it does not specify if the harm is related to bacteria. - 'Pollution': This term describes something that is unwanted and harmful. While pollution may contain bacteria, not all pollution does, making the term too broad for the specific situation of causing a bacterial invasion. - 'Foreign': Again, this word describes something originating from outside or alien to the body, but it's not necessarily harmful or infection-causing. - 'Barrel-shaped': This is irrelevant as it describes a physical form, and not the state, of the object which would lead to a bacterial invasion. - 'Contaminated': This term directly suggests the presence of harmful or undesired elements including bacteria. In conclusion, the term 'contaminated', referring to an object carrying bacteria or other impurities, clearly poses a risk of infection or bacterial invasion when someone scrapes themselves against it. Hence, 'contaminated' is the most appropriate answer among the given options."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Star Trek III: The Search for Spock Movie plot: The Federation Starship Enterprise returns to Earth following a battle with the superhuman Khan Noonien Singh, who tried to destroy the Enterprise by detonating an experimental terraforming device known as Genesis. The casualties of the fight include Admiral James T. Kirk's Vulcan friend, Spock, whose casket was launched into space and eventually landed on the planet created by the Genesis Device. On arriving at Earth Spacedock, Doctor Leonard McCoy begins to act strangely and is detained. Starfleet Admiral Morrow visits the Enterprise and informs the crew the ship is to be decommissioned; the crew is ordered not to speak about Genesis due to political fallout over the device. David Marcus (Merritt Butrick)âKirk's son, a key scientist in Genesis's developmentâand Lieutenant Saavik (Robin Curtis) are investigating the Genesis planet on board the science vessel Grissom. Discovering an unexpected life form on the surface, Marcus and Saavik transport to the planet. They find that the Genesis Device has resurrected Spock in the form of a child, although his mind is not present. Marcus admits that he used unstable \\"protomatter\\" in the development of the Genesis Device, causing Spock to age rapidly and meaning the planet will be destroyed within hours. Meanwhile, Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), the commander of a Klingon vessel, intercepts information about Genesis. Believing the device to be potentially useful as a weapon, he takes his cloaked ship to the Genesis planet, destroys the Grissom, and takes hostage Marcus, Saavik, and Spock. Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard), confronts Kirk about his son's death. The pair learn that before he died, Spock transferred his katra, or living spirit, to McCoy. Spock's katra and body are needed to lay him to rest on his homeworld, Vulcan, and without help, McCoy will die from carrying the katra.

My wedding experiences were both very different, even though I cried at both ceremonies. At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn’t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn’t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently — I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. Some years after that lengthy incarceration ended, I was fortunate to wed again. I had not done any manual labor before our wedding day. My hands were fine. Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves. We were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance. We had written our own vows, in fact, our own ceremony, including our own rituals. And yes, I cried, because I was / am so in love with my bride.

The statistical significance of results obtained for different challenge microbial agents and for different mask configurations (masks with operational or nonoperational ventilation fans and masks with sealed Smart Valves) was assessed. Results: The results demonstrate >99.7% efficiency of each test mask configuration for exclusion of influenza A virus, rhinovirus 14, and S. aureus and >99.3% efficiency for paraffin oil and sodium chloride (surrogates for PM 2.5 ). Statistically significant differences in effectiveness of the different mask configurations were not identified. The efficiencies of the masks for excluding smaller-size (i.e., rhinovirus and bacteriophage ΦΧ174) vs. larger-size microbial agents (influenza virus, S. aureus) were not significantly different. Conclusions: The masks, with or without features intended for enhancing comfort, provide protection against both small-and large-size pathogens. Importantly, the mask appears to be highly efficient for filtration of pathogens, including influenza and rhinoviruses, as well as the fine particulates (PM 2.5 ) present in aerosols that represent a greater challenge for many types of dental and surgical masks. This renders this individual-use N95 respiratory mask an improvement over the former types of masks for protection against a variety of environmental contaminants including PM 2.5 and pathogens such as influenza and rhinoviruses.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: Dr. Joost Vander Auwera (born 24 January 1957) is a Belgian art historian and museum curator. He is Senior Curator at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. He is the Co-Founder and Project Leader of the international multidisciplinary Jordaens Van Dyck Panel Paintings Project and the Project Leader for the establishment of the visitors centre at the Brueghel House, Brussels. Hypothesis: Dr. Joost Vander Auwera lives in Brussels.","completion":"We can reasonably draw the hypothesis that Dr. Joost Vander Auwera lives in Brussels from the context provided. Here is a detailed breakdown of how we can come to this hypothesis: 1. Dr. Joost Vander Auwera is a Belgian art historian and museum curator, which establishes his professional background and connection to Belgium. 2. He is the Senior Curator at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. This implies that his primary place of work is in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. It is common for people to live relatively close to their workplaces for practical reasons such as minimizing daily commuting time and optimizing work-life balance. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is a high possibility he resides in Brussels. 3. Dr. Vander Auwera is also the Project Leader for the establishment of the visitors center at the Brueghel House, Brussels. This further strengthens the connection between his professional activities and the city of Brussels. Taking up a leadership role in such a project usually demands time, commitment, and accessibility to the site, suggesting that he may live in Brussels to conveniently fulfill these obligations. 4. As the Co-Founder and Project Leader of the international multidisciplinary Jordaens Van Dyck Panel Paintings Project, Dr. Vander Auwera's professional interests align with the cultural and artistic scene in Brussels, making it more likely for him to reside in the city with rich artistic heritage. It is important to mention that the hypothesis, despite being based on the context provided and some reasonable assumptions, cannot be stated as a certainty without explicit confirmation or more concrete information about the exact location of Dr. Vander Auwera's residency. However, it is plausible and highly likely based on his professional associations and engagements with Brussels."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The group was founded by Suffa (Matthew David Lambert) and MC Pressure (Daniel Howe Smith), who were joined by DJ Debris (Barry John M. Francis) after fellow founder, DJ Next (Ben John Hare), left in 1999. The group released its first extended play, Back Two of Hilltop Hoods' founders first met in 1987 when MC Suffa (aka Matthew David Lambert) and MC Pressure (Daniel Howe Smith) attended Blackwood High School in Eden Hills - a suburb of Adelaide. In 1991 they joined up with DJ Next (Ben John Hare) through a mutual friend and formed an Australian hip hop group. Their name was supplied by fellow local MC Flak (from Cross Bred Mongrels) - the suburb of Blackwood is known by locals as the Hilltop. The band's influences include American hip hop artists: Notorious B.I.G., KRS-One, Gang Starr, Wu-Tang Clan and Public Enemy. At live shows Next was the group's DJ, for recording he contributed audio engineering and all the scratching/turntablism on their early works. He regularly competed in the local DMC World DJ Championships (DMC) tournaments, winning the South Australian DMC championships multiple times. Hilltop Hoods recorded a demo, Highlanders, which was released on cassette tape only. As well as Pressure and Suffa on vocals, the group included MC Summit aka DJ Sum-1, but he did not appear on later Hilltop Hoods work. The group's first official release, in 1997, was a vinyl-only, seven-track extended play, Back Once Again. Production was handled by DJ Debris (Barry John M Francis), turntablism and audio engineering by Next, vocals by Pressure and Suffa. The third track, \\"Shades of Grey\\", features Debris with a verse, and was co-written by Francis, Hare, Lambert and Smith. Fifth track, \\"Mankind Must Suffa\\" also features a guest verse from Quromystix (aka Quro, Andrew Michael Bradley) - a member of Finger Lickin' Good and later the Fuglemen. \\"Mankind Must Suffa\\" is credited to Lambert, Smith, Francis and Bradley. Back Once Again is out of print and unavailable for retail purchase. The group's debut studio album, A Matter of Time, was released in 1999 on CD only. As with Back Once Again, it is now unavailable for retail purchase. All scratching/turntablism is performed by Next, a track, \\"Let Me Show You\\", has no vocals - solely showcasing his turntable skills. American MC Bukue One (Tion Torrence) appears for a guest verse on \\"Deaf Can Hear\\". The track is credited to Lambert, Smith, Francis, Hare and Torrence. The album was released independently but with financial assistance from Arts SA - the band were inspired, in 2005, to set up their own Hilltop Hoods Initiative, to help local artists. After the album appeared, Next left the group and moved to Melbourne. In 2004 he moved to London. In 1999 Debris, who was also a member of the Cross Bred Mongrels, replaced Next and became the Hilltop Hoods' full-time DJ. Hilltop Hoods founded the Certified Wise Crew - a hip hop collaborative - with local groups Terra Firma, Cross Bred Mongrels and After Hours. Certified Wise Crew has since expanded to include MCs Trauma, Blockade, Kolaps, Flea, with Vents and Funkoars joining in later years. Hilltop Hoods received two nominations for the Hip Hop Act of the Year Award at the Australian Dance Music Awards and again at the 3D World Music Awards in 2001 and 2002.

Plot title: Mike Bassett: England Manager Movie plot: The film starts with Mike Bassett (Tomlinson) winning a trophy with Norwich City. During the open top bus party, the bus takes a wrong turning and the team have to endure a very cold, lengthly detour up the A11.After the opening titles, the news comes in that England manager Phil Cope has had a heart attack, and a meeting takes place in which the members of the Football Association board must find a new manager to take them into the World Cup finals in Brazil. They are faced with problems in that the most successful Premier League manager is Scottish, the second most successful is too much of a \\"bigmouth\\" for the F.A.'s liking despite otherwise seeming perfect for the role, and all the other English managers in the Premier League come up with an increasingly ridiculous set of excuses to turn down the job. Still wanting to appoint an English manager, they look to the league below, Division One.As the press gather at Mike's house, he has no idea that they are there and unwittingly reveals himself (in polite terms) to them. As he speaks to them and says that he is not the England manager, his son Jason appears saying \\"Dad, you've got the England job.\\" Despite some recent bad results that caused the press to turn aggressively on Phil Cope, England are still theoretically in a strong position to qualify, and can make sure of it with either a single victory or avoiding defeat in their three remaining games.At his first meeting at Lancaster Gate (the home of English football) he is informed that he is allowed to pick his own assistant and coach.

First question: Is a brown discharge during your first period normal? Second question: Why is the very first period a brown discharge? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: Is a brown discharge during your first period normal? Yes, a brown discharge during your first period is normal and nothing to be worried about. The color of the menstrual blood may vary from bright red to brown, and it can sometimes have a darker, even black, appearance. The reason for this brown coloration is due to the presence of oxidized blood and endometrial tissue, which makes the blood appear older and darker. It is common for women and girls, especially during their first menstrual period called menarche, to notice a brown discharge. Menstrual blood may look different at various times in your cycle, and each individual's period is unique. Factors such as hormonal changes, the length of your menstrual cycle, and the heaviness of menstrual flow may influence the color of the menstrual blood. Brown discharge during the first period is not a cause for concern unless it is accompanied by a foul smell, severe pain, or abnormal bleeding patterns. Second question: Why is the very first period a brown discharge? The very first period often appears as a brown discharge because it is typically lighter and less heavy compared to periods later in life. This initial period, known as menarche, marks the beginning of a girl's menstrual cycle and fertility. During menarche, the body is undergoing hormonal changes and the reproductive system is still developing, which might result in a lighter bleeding. As a result, the menstrual blood spends more time within the uterus and vaginal canal, giving it more time to oxidize and turn brown. Also, the first period sometimes consists of not only fresh blood but also remnants of the endometrial lining, which contributes to a brownish coloration. As your body adjusts to the new hormonal changes and establishes a regular menstrual cycle, later periods may become heavier and appear in a brighter red color. Are these two questions asking the same thing? While these two questions are related, they are not asking exactly the same thing. The first question is inquiring whether a brown discharge during your first period is normal, focusing on reassurance and whether there is any cause for concern. The answer to this question provides the necessary context and reassurance that it is a normal occurrence for many women. The second question is asking for an explanation of why the very first period is a brown discharge, seeking more information on the underlying reasons for the brown coloration during menarche. The answer to this question delves into the causes behind the appearance of the brown discharge during the first period, including hormonal changes and the nature of the initial menstrual cycle. In summary, while the two questions are closely related and may often be discussed together, they are not identical inquiries. The first question focuses on the normalcy of brown discharge during the first period, whereas the second question aims to identify and understand the reasons behind this phenomenon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer based on context: There is some disagreement on which country has the largest proven gas reserves. Sources that consider that Russia has by far the largest proven reserves include the US CIA (47 600 km³), the US Energy Information Administration (47 800 km³), and OPEC (48 700 km³). However, BP credits Russia with only 32 900 km³, which would place it in second place, slightly behind Iran (33 100 to 33 800 km³, depending on the source). With Gazprom, Russia is frequently the worlds largest natural gas extractor. Major proven resources (in cubic kilometers) are world 187 300 (2013), Iran 33 600 (2013), Russia 32 900 (2013), Qatar 25 100 (2013), Turkmenistan 17 500 (2013) and the United States 8500 (2013). What are all the countries in 2013 that are major natural gas extractors?","completion":"In 2013, several countries were major natural gas extractors, contributing significantly to the global supply of natural gas. Here is a list of these countries along with their proven reserves in cubic kilometers, as mentioned in the context provided: 1. Iran: With proven reserves of approximately 33,600 km³ in 2013, Iran was one of the leading natural gas extractors. Iran's South Pars gas field is one of the largest in the world, contributing a significant portion of the country's natural gas production. 2. Russia: The country held proven reserves of about 32,900 km³ in 2013 and was a major player in the global natural gas market. Russia's gas production primarily came from major fields like Urengoy, Yamburg, and Bovanenko. 3. Qatar: In 2013, Qatar had proven natural gas reserves of approximately 25,100 km³. Qatar is known for its vast North Field, which is the largest non-associated gas field globally. 4. Turkmenistan: The Central Asian nation possessed approximately 17,500 km³ of proven natural gas reserves in 2013. With major fields like Galkynysh and South Yoloten, Turkmenistan played a key role in natural gas extraction in the region. 5. United States: Holding around 8,500 km³ of proven natural gas reserves in 2013, the United States was another major extractor. The US saw a significant increase in natural gas production during this time, primarily due to the rise in shale gas extraction through hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. In addition to these, other major natural gas extracting countries in 2013 included: 6. Saudi Arabia: With proven reserves of over 7,000 km³, Saudi Arabia was also a major natural gas producer. 7. United Arab Emirates (UAE): With around 6,000 km³ of proven reserves, the UAE was a significant natural gas extractor in the Middle East. 8. Venezuela: Holding about 5,500 km³ of proven reserves, Venezuela was a major natural gas producer in South America. 9. Nigeria: With approximately 5,100 km³ of proven reserves in 2013, Nigeria was Africa's largest natural gas extractor. 10. Algeria: With around 4,500 km³ of proven reserves, Algeria was another prominent natural gas producer in Africa. 11. Australia: Holding close to 3,800 km³ of proven reserves, Australia was a major natural gas extractor in the Asia-Pacific region. While the exact rankings may have changed since 2013, these countries remain important players in the global natural gas market. As advancements in extraction technology and new discoveries continue to occur, the landscape of natural gas production may evolve in the years to come."},{"prompt":"What is the full name of the person who does Christabel's portrait?

When I was a patrolman working the 11PM to 7AM shift we received a phone call from a police department about 200 miles away in a neighboring state. It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Bangkok has become the world's top tourist destination, with 15.98 million visitors projected to visit Thailand's capital city this year, according to the third annual Global Destination Cities Index released by MasterCard on Monday. Based on data MasterCard collected from governments, central banks, related public agencies and airlines so far this year, the projection for the entire year says Bangkok is surpassing London, the previous holder of the top place, by a very narrow margin. Monday's report marked the first time an Asian city has been projected to be the top-ranked tourist destination. London came in second, with 15.96 million visitors expected in 2013, and Paris, third, with 13.92 million visitors. MasterCard looked at 132 cities. Other Asian cities that made it to the Top-20 Global Destination Cities in 2013 include Singapore at number four, with 11.75 million visitors; Kuala Lumpur at number eight, with 9.2 million visitors; Hong Kong at number nine, with 8.72 million visitors; Seoul at number 11, with 8.19 million visitors; Shanghai at number 14, with 6.5 million visitors, Tokyo at number 16, with 5.8 million visitors, and Taipei, with 5.19 million visitors. The study found that Bangkok is experiencing a large increase in its number of tourists in 2013, up 9.8% from 2009. That compares to New York's increase at 5.0% and London's at 3.8%. Paris, meanwhile, saw a small dip in its number of tourists (negative 0.7%). Caroline Lledo, who was visiting Bangkok from France, said Thailand has many offerings. \\"We like culture and the people are so nice. We also love shopping here,\\" Ms. Lledo said. MasterCard Worldwide's global economic adviser Yuwa Hedrick-Wong cited overall value for money spent for why Bangkok is attractive. That is true for Thailand overall as well. Answer:","completion":"Which of the following statements about Bangkok as a tourist destination is correct, according to the third annual Global Destination Cities Index released by MasterCard? A) Bangkok was the second most visited city in the world in 2013, right after London, with a projected 15.98 million visitors. B) According to the MasterCard Index, Bangkok has surpassed London in tourism for the first time in 2013, with an increase in tourist numbers of 9.8% from 2009. C) The report indicates a decrease in visitors to Bangkok in 2013, despite being named a top tourist destination. D) Bangkok is the first European city projected to be the top-ranked tourist destination according to the Global Destination Cities Index. Correct Answer: B) According to the MasterCard Index, Bangkok has surpassed London in tourism for the first time in 2013, with an increase in tourist numbers of 9.8% from 2009. Explanation: The article states that Bangkok was projected to be the world's top tourist destination in 2013 with 15.98 million visitors according to the MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index. Furthermore, the report marked the first time an Asian city had been projected to surpass all other global cities in terms of tourism, thereby making option B the correct choice. London, which was the previous holder of the top spot, came in second place with an expected 15.96 million visitors. This shows that option A is incorrect. Option C is also wrong because the article highlights that the number of tourists to Bangkok increased by 9.8% from 2009, not decreased.

Q:Process: - Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The rocks slowly break down. Question: suppose Load dishes directly into dishwasher after use happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"C: no effect The process of weathering, as mentioned in the description, primarily involves the physical and chemical breakdown of rocks due to exposure to environmental factors such as water seeping into the rocks, freeze-thaw actions, and temperature fluctuations. The process of loading dishes directly into a dishwasher after use is not related to the natural processes of weathering and, therefore, would have no effect on the rate or occurrence of weathering. Loading dishes directly into a dishwasher is associated with maintaining cleanliness and order in households and minimizing the need for washing and drying dishes manually. It has no direct connection to the geological processes involved in weathering, which predominantly occurs outdoors and is influenced by factors like climate, atmospheric conditions, and the type of rock or mineral being broken down. While it's important to understand the relevance of different human activities on the environment, it's equally important to recognize which activities bear no direct impact. For instance, pollution, deforestation, or construction may indeed modify the natural conditions affecting weathering processes. However, household activities like dishwashing do not contribute to such alterations, and thus have no effect on whether weathering occurs more or less frequently or rapidly. In conclusion, loading dishes directly into a dishwasher after use has no effect on the occurrence or rate of weathering, as it is an unrelated activity that doesn't impact geological processes. The question's focus should be directed towards discussing human actions that do alter the environment and influence elements such as weathering, erosion, and climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: How might I feel about this ?","completion":"To determine how you might feel about this situation, I will evaluate each emotion and justify the reasoning behind each possible choice. 1. Bored: Since getting pulled over for an RBT and dealing with heavy traffic on the F5 are both external events that caused you to be late to work, it seems unlikely that you would feel bored in this situation. Boredom is generally linked to a lack of stimulating or engaging experiences, which doesn't align with the situation described. Therefore, 'bored' is not a strong match for your feelings. 2. Angry: Considering you were delayed because of being pulled over for an RBT and subsequently having to deal with traffic on F5, it's reasonable to believe that these factors would cause frustration and irritation. Arriving late to work and being signed in late could also contribute to negative feelings. Thus, 'angry' is a plausible emotion for you to feel in this situation. 3. None of the above choices: If neither boredom nor anger adequately describes your emotions in the given situation, this option would hold true. 4. Curious: Curiosity is typically associated with a desire to gain knowledge or information. While there may have been slight curiosity regarding the reasons behind the heavy traffic on F5, for example, it's unlikely that curiosity would be the dominant emotion in response to being pulled over and arriving late to work.

When high voltage applied to the gate NMOS will conduct why? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? OPT: (a). no (b). yes","completion":"(a). No These two questions are inquiring about different aspects of technology. The first question is related to Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVTs) and their role in the future of transportation, especially with the advent of Electric Vehicles (EVs). The second question, on the other hand, is related to the functioning of n-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (NMOS) when high voltage is applied to the gate. To address each question individually: 1. CVTs and their role in the future of transportation: Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVTs) are automatic transmissions that allow for an infinite number of gear ratios between a vehicle's lowest and highest gears. They offer a smooth driving experience and improved fuel efficiency compared to traditional automatic or manual transmissions. CVTs have been widely used in internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles for quite some time. With the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs), it may appear that CVTs may no longer hold a significant role in the future of transportation. The reason is that EVs have simpler drivetrain systems. They do not typically require multi-speed transmissions, as the electric motors in most EVs have the ability to deliver maximum torque across a wide range of speeds. This eliminates the need for gear shifting and allows for a more efficient, responsive, and smooth driving experience. Furthermore, electric vehicles utilize a single-speed transmission, which drastically simplifies the entire drivetrain and allows for better packaging, reduced weight, lower cost, and improved reliability compared to some ICE vehicles. However, this does not entirely rule out the possibility of CVTs playing a role in future transportation systems. Hybrid vehicles, which rely on a combination of combustion engines and electric motors, may continue to benefit from CVTs, especially for optimizing the ICE's efficiency in various driving situations. In addition, advancements in CVT technology or specific EV applications may open up new opportunities for utilizing CVTs in electric powertrains. Some manufacturers are experimenting with multi-speed transmissions for electric cars to further improve driving dynamics or efficiency at high speeds. 2. High voltage applied to the gate of an NMOS: When high voltage is applied to the gate of an n-channel MOSFET (NMOS), it conducts because of the formation of an electric field in the device's channel region. The gate voltage controls how much current flows between the drain and the source terminals. As an NMOS transistor operates, it switches between two states: the \\"on\\" state (conducting) and the \\"off\\" state (non-conducting). When a high voltage (ideally above the threshold voltage) is applied to the gate terminal, an electric field is formed in the channel region, creating a conducting path between the source and drain terminals. The higher the voltage applied to the gate, the stronger the electric field and the lower the resistance of the channel, leading to an increase in current flow between the drain and source. This causes the NMOS device to be in the \\"on\\" state. In summary, the two questions inquire about separate technological fields. The first question asks about the potential role of CVTs in the future transportation context, particularly with the rise of electric vehicles. The second question deals with the conductivity of NMOS transistors when high voltage is applied to the gate. Both topics are relevant and important in their respective domains but are not directly related to each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The cougar (Puma concolor), also commonly known as the puma, mountain lion, panther, or catamount, is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae native to the Americas. Its range, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America, is the widest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in most American habitat types. It is the biggest cat in North America and the second-heaviest cat in the New World after the jaguar. Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur. The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (subfamily Felinae), than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae, of which only the jaguar is native to the Americas. is a mountain lion and cougar the same thing? OPT: (i). no. (ii). yes.","completion":"(ii). Yes, a mountain lion and cougar are the same species. They are known by various names such as puma, panther, or catamount, depending on the region they are found in. The scientific name of this species is Puma concolor, and it is the largest felid in North America, belonging to the subfamily Felinae. The cougar has a vast distribution, spanning from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America. This extensive range makes it the most widespread of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. Its adaptability to various habitats, including forests, grasslands, and even desert regions, has contributed to its widespread prevalence. Aside from its adaptability, the cougar is also a generalist species, meaning that it can eat a variety of prey. Its primary diet consists of ungulates, such as deer and elk, but it also consumes smaller mammals like rabbits, rodents, and even insects when necessary. This ability to switch between different prey enables the cougar to thrive in diverse environments. Being a solitary animal, the cougar is rarely seen in groups except during mating season or when a mother is rearing her cubs. It is primarily nocturnal and crepuscular, with the majority of its activities taking place during dawn and dusk. However, daytime sightings are not uncommon. Due to its secretive nature and preference for habitats with dense undergrowth or rocky terrain, the cougar can be difficult to observe in the wild. Despite its size and power, the cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, such as the domestic cat, than to the larger cats of the subfamily Pantherinae. Its closest relative in the Americas is the jaguar, which belongs to the Pantherinae subfamily. The cougar's evolutionary lineage places it in the same subfamily as the lynx, ocelot, and serval, indicating a closer relationship to these smaller species. In summary, the mountain lion and cougar are indeed the same species, known by different names depending on the region. As an adaptable and generalist species, the cougar has the broadest distribution of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere and is closely related to smaller felines like the domestic cat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Article: Sons who have fond childhood memories of their fathers are more likely to be emotionally stable in the face of day-to-day stresses, according to psychologists who studied hundreds of adults of all ages. \\"As our study shows, fathers do play a unique and important role in the mental health of their children much later in life,\\" psychology professor Melanie Mallers of California State University said. For this study, 912 adult men and women between the ages of 25 and 74 completed short daily telephone interviews about that day's experiences over an eight-day period. The interviews focused on the participants' psychological and emotional distress (i.e.whether they were nervous, sad, etc.) and if they had experienced any stressful events that day. The participants were also required to answer questions such as, \\"How would you rate your relationship with your mother during the years when you were growing up?\\" and \\"How much time and attention did your mother give you when you needed it?\\" The same questions were asked about fathers. People who reported they had a good mother-child relationship reported three percent less psychological distress compared to those who reported a poor relationship, according to Mallers. Men who reported having a good relationship with their fathers during childhood were more likely to be less emotional when reacting to stressful events in their current daily lives than those who had a poor relationship, according to her findings. Also, the quality of mother and father relationships was significantly associated with how many stressful events the participants faced on a daily basis. In other words, if they had a poor childhood relationship with both parents, they reported more stressful incidents over the eight-day study when compared to those who had a good relationship with their parents. Mallers explained why healthy or unhealthy relationships may have an effect on how people handle stress as adults. \\"Perhaps having caring parents equips children with the experiences and skills necessary to more successfully navigate their relationships with other people throughout childhood and into adulthood,\\" she said. Question: What do we know about the study from the passage? Options: (A) It paid close attention to the effect of fathers on their children. (B) 912 children and adults took part in the study.

The primary sentiment of this review is positive because the reviewer defends the location against a one-star rating, highlighting their own good experiences with the service and ice cream. They mention their loyalty to the location, having been a regular customer for two years, and that they've always enjoyed the quality of the products. This positive sentiment is further emphasized by the use of a smiley face, showing that the reviewer is happy and satisfied with their experience at the Cold Stone Creamery.

But did you ever wonder how and why this happens? To answer the question, first you have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Leaves are nature's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots. And they take a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into glucose . Glucose is a kind of sugar. Plants use glucose as food for energy and as a building block for growing. The way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis . That means, \\"putting together with light\\". A chemical called chlorophyll helps photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color1. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter. This is how trees \\"know\\" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. Trees rest during this time and live off the food they stored during the summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. As the bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange leaves. Small amounts of these color1s have been in the leaves all along. We just can't see them in the summer, because they are covered up by the green chlorophyll. The bright reds and yellows we see in leaves are made mostly in autumn. In some trees, like maples, glucose is caught in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn turn this glucose into a red color1. The brown color1 of trees like oaks is made from waste left in the leaves. It is the mixture of all these things that makes the beautiful color1s we enjoy during autumn. From the text we can see that photosynthesis _ . A) can produce glucose, which can provide energy for trees' growth B) can happen whenever there is light and water C) is the process of putting sunlight together with chlorophyll D) doesn't stop during the trees' lifetime even in winter","completion":"A) can produce glucose, which can provide energy for trees' growth"},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The Rams were successful at limiting the Seahawks offense, holding running back Marshawn Lynch to a season low of only 23 yards and sacking quarterback Russell Wilson seven times. After holding the Rams to a field goal in the first quarter, the Seahawks went ahead with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate. The Rams responded in the third quarter with another field goal, cutting down the Seahawks' lead to 1. After an incomplete pass to Jermaine Kearse on the first play of the next drive, Wilson threw an 80-yard touchdown to Golden Tate. It was the longest play of either player's career. On his way towards the end zone, Tate turned and sarcastically waved towards Rams safety Rodney McLeod. Though the touchdown would count, the Seahawks would be penalized for taunting during the kickoff. Carroll chastised Tate after the penalty occurred, and Tate was fined 7,875 after the game. After the Seahawks allowed an additional Rams field goal, the game came down to the final drive. The Rams, in possession of the ball with 5:42 left in the game, managed to drive the ball all the way to the 6 yard line with less than 1:20 left on the clock.

After a series of plays, including a missed throw by Rams' quarterback Kellen Clemens and a 4-yard run by Rams' running back Daryl Richardson, the Rams had a 3rd and Goal situation at the 2-yard line. A defensive offsides call on Seahawks defensive end Chris Clemons cut the distance in half, but the Seahawks still managed to stop an additional run from Richardson. With only 4 seconds left in the game, Rams' head coach Jeff Fisher called a timeout, setting up a final play for their team. Seahawks' cornerback Brandon Browner successfully defended Clemens's final pass towards Brian Quick, sealing the victory for Seattle and making their season record 7-1. In conclusion, the Seattle Seahawks allowed the least points during this Monday Night Football game by limiting the St. Louis Rams to only 9 points from three successful field goals. The effective and resilient defense of the Seahawks played a crucial role in securing their victory in this thrilling encounter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: French people pride themselves on their delicious foods, such as cheese, baguettes and croissants(two kinds of food). In fact, food is an important part of French culture. Families and friends spend hours over the dinner table each night. It is the opposite of the fast-food habit common in other parts of the West. It's the reason why the French are very angry that a McDonald's is opening beneath Paris's most famous museum: the Louvre . The new restaurant will be the 1,142nd McDonald's in France, and will open in the underground approach to the museum. But many French people can't understand why this American chain is opening in the heart of French culture. However, McDonald's is paying no notice to the complaint. McDonald's now has 31,000 chains worldwide. Tourists are hungry, and opening chains in tourist spots pays well. There is another chain threatening France's heritage. This time it is coffee rather than burgers. As more and more Starbucks open in Paris, traditional French cafes are forced to close. The trouble with American companies opening chains throughout the world is the destructive effect they can have on a country's culture. How can a small, independent coffee shop compete with the multi-billion dollar chain? You can go to a Starbucks in any city in the world, but you can only go to a Parisian cafe in France. Responsibility is with the tourists. A McDonald's wouldn't open so near the Louvre if it weren't not going to make money. Similarly, a Pizza Hut wouldn't overlook Egypt's Great Pyramid if no one wants to sit in it. Maybe next time you visit the Great Wall, you should think twice before ordering a Cappuccino in the Starbucks. Question: What is the trouble with American companies opening chains all over the world? Answer: Options are: 1). The traditional stores of a country are forced to fight back.; 2). The traditional stores of a country become dependant.; 3). They have negative effect on a country's culture.; 4). The multi-billion dollar chain can't be matched.; Answer:","completion":"3).

Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

Barry Layne Moore is accused of selling prescription Oxycodone. Smith elaborated to the Toronto Sun: “I feel sorry for the people of Toronto—it is like something bad happening in the family, it kind of embarrasses the whole family.\\" He called on Ford to resign and said he understood that the city didn't have any way to force him out of office. In Hampton, by contrast, the process is already underway to suspend Moore. (While Toronto's city council can't oust Ford, it has stripped him of most of his powers.) Article:","completion":"Title: Toronto's Mayoral Scandal Draws Comparisons to Florida's Hampton City: A Tale of Two Cities Introduction In a surprising turn of events, residents of Toronto find themselves being looked down upon by the police in Florida, thanks to Mayor Rob Ford's myriad troubles. As it turns out, Toronto isn't the only city dealing with elected officials involved in illegal drug activity. Bradford County in Florida is experiencing a similar controversy with the arrest of the city of Hampton's mayor, Barry Layne Moore, on drug charges. Municipalities Grapple with Mayoral Drug Charges Bradford County's sheriff, Gordon Smith, was quoted saying, \\"This isn't Toronto,\\" after arresting Moore for selling prescription Oxycodone. In an interview with the Toronto Sun, Smith expressed sympathy for the people of Toronto, stating, “I feel sorry for the people of Toronto—it is like something bad happening in the family, it kind of embarrasses the whole family.\\" Acknowledging the situation is embarrassing for both cities, Sheriff Smith calls for Ford to resign, much like the process that has been initiated for Moore in Hampton. Smith expounded further on the matter, emphasizing that in Bradford County, \\"We will not tolerate illegal drug activity\\" by anyone, including elected officials such as mayors. Unfortunately, for the citizens of Toronto, the city does not have any way to force Ford out of office. This contrasts sharply with Hampton, where a suspension process is already underway for Moore's removal from his position as mayor. Repercussions and the Power of City Councils While both cities face the challenge of having mayors involved in drug scandals, the power dynamics within their respective city councils differ significantly. Toronto has already taken steps to limit Ford's powers as mayor, but the city council does not have the ability to oust him. This means that, unless Ford chooses to resign, he can continue to hold the position of mayor despite his legal troubles. On the other hand, Hampton's city council is acting swiftly to suspend Moore in light of the charges laid against him. The stark difference in the powers held by the city councils of Toronto and Hampton highlight the unique circumstances faced by each city. Conclusion The unfolding events in both Toronto and the city of Hampton in Florida showcase not only the public's dissatisfaction with elected officials involved in illegal drug activity, but also the varied ways in which city councils are able to address the issue. As these two cities navigate through the challenges presented by their respective mayoral scandals, the world watches and waits to see how the situations will be resolved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The members of this phylum are commonly referred to as segmented worms or ringed worms. The main characteristic that distinguishes them is their long, cylindrical body divided into segments. The phylum Annelida comprises different types of worms including earthworms, leeches, marine worms like polychaetes, and species found in freshwater environments. Earthworms are perhaps the most known annelids. They have bodies composed of ring-like segments called annuli. These creatures are well-known for their role in soil aeration and composting. Their ability to break down organic material helps to fertilize the soil and thus supports the growth of plants. Another commonly recognized group within Annelida phylum are the leeches. These creatures are often found in freshwater environments, though some species exist in marine and terrestrial habitats. Some are notorious for being ectoparasites, feeding on the blood of their hosts, but many species are actually predatory, feeding on small invertebrates. Polychaetes, also known as bristle worms, make up a large part of the Annelida phylum, with a significant presence in marine environments. They're often recognized by the bristles, or chaetae, that project from their bodies. These worms vary widely in habit and form, ranging from tiny to very large species. Some are free-swimming, others live within tubes they construct in the sediment, and yet others are burrowers. Each of these creatures -- earthworms, leeches, and polychaete worms -- are readily recognized examples of the diversity within the phylum Annelida. The animals mentioned in the statement like snails, clams, and squids actually belong to the phylum Mollusca. This is a completely different phylum known for invertebrates with soft bodies, which are often protected by a hard shell. This phylum encompasses a broad range of creatures including not only snails, clams, and squids, but also octopuses, oysters, mussels, and numerous other organisms. While both phyla are grouped within the larger category of invertebrates, annelids and mollusks differ significantly in body structure and other characteristics. Therefore, snails, clams, and squids are not a correct response to the query regarding members of the phylum Annelida."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please write a short summary for the following article: How the Wilhelm Gustloff Was Sunk The sinking of the Titanic may be the most infamous naval disaster in history, and the torpedoing of the Lusitania the most infamous in wartime. But with death counts of about 1,500 and 1,200 respectively, both are dwarfed by what befell the Wilhelm Gustloff, a German ocean liner that was taken down by a Soviet sub on Jan. 30, 1945, killing 9,343 people—most of them war refugees, about 5,000 of them children. The victims of the worst maritime tragedy in history were not only Germans, but also Prussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Poles, Estonians and Croatians. World War II was drawing to an end, and the Soviet army was advancing. Though it would be months before the final fall of the Nazi regime, it was clear the end was coming—and they were desperate to escape before things came to a head. As a result, 10,582 people were packed onto a cruise ship that was meant to accommodate only about 1,900. Though some on the ship were Nazis themselves, others had been the victims of Nazi aggression. When three torpedoes hit the ship, there weren’t nearly enough lifeboats, and many of the those that did exist were frozen to the deck. The majority of the passengers drowned. Why is this event so little known? Novelist Ruta Sepetys can’t say for sure, but its obscurity made it exactly the kind of story she wanted to tell. The author has written a book for young readers called Salt to the Sea, out Tuesday, about four fictional young passengers on the Wilhelm Gustloff: an overeager Nazi manning the ship; a Lithuanian nurse doing her part but haunted by her past; a Polish girl concealing her nationality and the source of her pregnancy; and a Prussian carrying something Hitler wants. Sepetys, an international bestseller thanks to her first novel Between Shades of Gray (which shares a character crossover with Salt to the Sea) is drawn to “hidden histories.” She looked into the Wilhelm Gustloff after finding out that a cousin of hers would have been on board were it not for a last-minute decision to delay the travel, a choice that the cousin had feared would prove the wrong one. As it departed, “she was standing in the port crying, thinking that her life was over,” Sepetys says. The decision likely saved her life, in fact. Intrigued, Sepetys immersed herself in research, particularly relying on the book Death in the Baltic but also on firsthand accounts from survivors she interviewed. “I hope this doesn’t sound too dramatic,” she says, “but what surprised me the most was that anyone survived.” With the help of her publisher in Poland, she even tracked down two divers who had explored the wreck in the late ’60s under Soviet supervision. The Soviets were allegedly curious to see if the Germans had tried to use the refugee ship to evacuate treasure, too. “They did not share with me exactly what they brought up,” Sepetys says, “but yes, things were retrieved. And then there were instructions to detonate parts of the ship, because it was considered an obstruction in the water.” So why do so few people know about the Wilhelm Gustloff? Sepetys has a couple of theories. First, the Nazi regime actively tried to hide the facts. “They were amidst an evacuation and they didn’t want it to affect morale. They also were trying to hide the fact they were losing the war,” she says. “Some survivors reported that when they spoke of it, there was a knock on their door, and they were told, ‘Why are you telling stories about some ship? That didn’t happen.'” In the aftermath of the war, she adds, Germans were hesitant to claim that they had been victims of any kind, so those who were free to discuss what had happened might have chosen not to. Another reason, she says, “could be that the submarine captain [who sank the ship], Alexander Marinesko, was dishonorably discharged shortly after,” apparently for disorderly conduct. At the time, Sepetys guesses, the Russians did not want to draw attention to him—though in later years monuments would be dedicated to his naval valor. The Wilhelm Gustloff interested Sepetys as a story about refugees because her own Lithuanian father spent nine years in refugee camps before being settled in the U.S.—but she had no idea when she began her work that the story would prove relevant on a global scale, as the current influx of migrants in Europe draws comparisons to the migrations of the past. The author hopes getting to know her protagonists could help young readers and grown-ups alike empathize with people in situations far from their own. “Many families don’t have recent experience or connection to occupation or war,” she says. “But through story and characters, suddenly news and history become human.” Summary:","completion":"The Wilhelm Gustloff, a German ocean liner, was sunk by a Soviet submarine on January 30, 1945, killing 9,343 people, the majority of which were war refugees and over 5,000 of them were children.

What are interpersonal relationships in nursing? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? OPT: [-] no. [-] yes.","completion":"In order to answer these questions, I will define interpersonal relationships in nursing, describe the formation of these relationships, and compare the two questions to determine if they are inquiring about the same information. Step 1: Define interpersonal relationships in nursing Interpersonal relationships in nursing refer to the connections, communication, and interactions between nurses and their patients, patients' families, and other healthcare professionals. These relationships can directly impact patient care outcomes and experiences, as well as nurses' job satisfaction and professional development. Step 2: Describe the formation of interpersonal relationships in nursing Interpersonal relationships in nursing occur through a combination of factors, such as: 1. Communication: Effective communication is key to forming strong relationships. Nurses need to be skilled in active listening, empathy, and expressing information clearly to facilitate trust between parties involved. 2. Emotional intelligence: Nurses with high emotional intelligence can better recognize, understand, and manage their own emotions, as well as the emotions of their patients. This helps in building rapport and maintaining strong ties with patients and colleagues. 3. Professionalism: Nurses maintaining a high degree of professionalism, adhering to nursing codes of ethics, and respecting patient confidentiality are more likely to be trusted by patients and colleagues, further enhancing relationships. 4. Collaboration: Nurses must work closely with various healthcare professionals, such as doctors, pharmacists, and therapists. Effective collaboration and mutual respect can lead to stronger interpersonal relationships in the healthcare team. 5. Cultural competence: Understanding and respecting the cultural backgrounds, beliefs, and values of diverse patient populations can improve nurse-patient relationships and contribute to better patient care. Step 3: Compare the two questions to determine if they are inquiring about the same information The first question asks, \\"How do interpersonal relationships in nursing occur?\\" This question seeks information about the formation and development of interpersonal relationships in the nursing context. The second question asks, \\"What are interpersonal relationships in nursing?\\" This question seeks a definition and understanding of the concept of interpersonal relationships in nursing. Although these two questions are related and overlap in some areas, they are not inquiring about the exact same information. The first question is more focused on how these relationships develop, while the second question is looking for a definition of the concept.

Movie title: Interstate 60 Movie plot: The story begins in a bar, where two men are discussing a thesis statement for an upcoming paper. One of them asserts that out of all the different realms of the world, America has no mythological character that grants wishes. Their conversation is interrupted by a man (Wayne Robson) who claims that they are wrong, and that such a character does exist. The man goes on to explain that this character is a man named O.W. Grant, the son of a Leprechaun and a Cheyenne Indian. The man explains that O.W. is more so apt to play tricks on people, but that every so often, he takes a shine to some of them. When the two men ask this stranger just what O.W. Grant looks like, the fellow replies that he wears a red bow tie, and smokes a pipe carved in the shape of a monkey-head. As the man leaves the two, he mentions that O.W. can be found along Interstate 60. The two men go to a nearby map, and after looking over the roadways, think the guy they were talking to must have been pulling there leg, as there is no Interstate 60.The scene then cuts to real-as-life O.W. Grant (Gary Oldman), wearing a red bow tie, and smoking a pipe carved in the shape of monkey-head (just as the guy described). Going down a street, a guy in a parked car to his right opens the driver's side door, not realizing O.W. is about to pass alongside. O.W. falls from his bike, breaking the jaw on his monkey-head pipe. As the man apologizes and attempts to help him up, a truck comes along, running over Grant's bike, and destroying the man's cellular phone. The destruction of the cellphone causes the man to break into a fury, cursing how he wishes the incident had never happened. Grant asks if the man means the wish, and when the angered fellow replies positively, Grant places his pipe in his mouth, and green smoke envelopes the two of them.The scene begins again, with Grant riding along the same path (though his monkey-head pipe is now broken). Just before Grant reaches the car, he stops. The man on the phone inside, gets out of the car... and steps right... Answer:","completion":"No, I can't provide the specific town in Colorado that the package is addressed to, as it is not mentioned in the plot summary of the movie \\"Interstate 60\\". However, I can provide some insights on whether it's worth investing in this film proposal by discussing its genre, target audience, and potential themes. \\"Interstate 60\\" is a film that falls under the genres of adventure, comedy, and fantasy. The blend of these genres has the potential to attract a diverse audience due to its mix of humor, mythical elements, and adventure. It could potentially appeal to fans of movies like \\"Big Fish\\" and \\"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\\". The target audience for this movie would be individuals who are interested in whimsical and thought-provoking films that explore the nature of wishes, myths, and destinies. The character of O.W. Grant and the involvement of his tricks on people could entice viewers who enjoy playful and mysterious characters with secret motives. Additionally, the film could explore themes such as human desire and the consequences of wishes coming true, creating a thought-provoking journey where the characters learn valuable life lessons. Furthermore, the movie's plot provides an opportunity for diverse settings, interesting scenes, and bizarre encounters that may intrigue viewers and keep them engaged throughout the storyline. However, it's crucial to consider the film proposal's budget, potential for profits, and associated risks before deciding to invest. You would need to analyze the attached budget breakdown, projected earnings, and the expertise of the production team to make an informed decision about the investment. If the script and funding are in place along with a capable team, it would strengthen the case for investing in this film proposal. In conclusion, \\"Interstate 60\\" has the potential to be a captivating and engaging film, but it's essential to weigh the costs and benefits before deciding to invest in it. Consider the attractiveness of the genre, target audience, and themes, along with the project's budget, potential earnings, and associated risks before making your decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution?","completion":"In order to solve the given equation 0 = 156*r - 116*r - 40 for r, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. We can combine the terms containing variable 'r', which are 156*r and -116*r. 0 = (156*r - 116*r) - 40 Step 2: Simplify the equation. Now, subtract 116*r from 156*r: 0 = 40*r - 40 Step 3: Isolate the variable 'r'. In this step, we will get 'r' alone on one side of the equation. To do this, we will add 40 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 40 = 40*r - 40 + 40 40 = 40*r Step 4: Solve for 'r'. Now, we have to get rid of the 40 that is multiplied with 'r'. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 40: 40/40 = 40*r/40 1 = r So, the solution for the equation 0 = 156*r -116*r - 40 is r = 1."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: Question: Where is a good place to keep a saucer you don't use but want to look at? Options: - kitchen - tea room - china cabinet - kitchen cabinet - cup Explain why a human would choose \\"china cabinet\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"china cabinet\\" as the ideal place to keep a saucer they don't use but want to look at for several reasons. A china cabinet, also known as a display cabinet, curio cabinet, or hutch, is a piece of furniture specifically designed for the purpose of displaying and storing valuable or decorative items, such as fine china, glassware, or collectibles. These cabinets often feature well-crafted woodwork and tempered glass doors that allow for easy visibility of the items stored inside. Here's a detailed explanation of why a china cabinet is the perfect choice for showcasing a saucer: 1. Preservation: A china cabinet offers a safe and secure place to store delicate items like a saucer. The enclosed design of the cabinet protects the saucer from dust, accidental damage, and wear and tear caused by regular handling. This ensures that the saucer remains in pristine condition, preserving its value and appearance for a long time. 2. Visibility: China cabinets are designed to display items prominently, making it easy for anyone to admire the saucer. The glass doors and sometimes built-in lighting showcase the saucer in the best possible light, allowing its details and craftsmanship to be clearly visible. This feature is particularly important if the saucer has sentimental value or is part of a larger collection that needs to be seen and appreciated. 3. Aesthetics: China cabinets are often attractive and elegant pieces of furniture that can enhance the décor of a living space. By placing the saucer in a china cabinet, it becomes a decorative element that can complement the existing design scheme of the room, adding a touch of sophistication and visual interest. This harmonizes well with the desire to look at the saucer and enjoy its beauty. 4. Organization: China cabinets are designed with shelves and compartments that allow for efficient organization and storage of items they hold. By placing the saucer in a china cabinet, it ensures that the item has a designated space within the home. This helps in minimizing clutter and maintaining a neat and orderly living environment. 5. Space utilization: In smaller homes or apartments, where space is a constraint, a china cabinet can be incredibly useful for maximizing available space. By consolidating all decorative and valuable items into one central location, a china cabinet prevents these objects from taking up valuable countertop, table or shelf space elsewhere in the home. In conclusion, a china cabinet is the best choice for storing and displaying a saucer that isn't regularly used but is meant to be looked at because it provides a safe, secure, and visually appealing environment for the saucer. The china cabinet showcases the beauty of the saucer while also contributing to the aesthetics and organization of the living space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In 1528, at the demand of Henry of the Palatinate, Prince-Bishop of Utrecht, Habsburg forces under Georg Schenck van Toutenburg, liberated the Bishopric, which was occupied by the Duchy of Guelders since 1521-1522. On October 20, 1528, Bishop Henry handed over power to Charles of Habsburg. The Bishopric of Utrecht came to an end and was divided into the Lordship of Utrecht and the Lordship of Overijssel, both ruled by a Habsburg Stadtholder.

Article:The man described in a leaked US cable as a \\"backroom deal-maker\\" served as deputy to former PM Abhisit Vejjajiva from 2008-2011. It was their administration that authorised a crackdown on anti-government street protests by supporters of ousted leader Thaksin Shinawatra in Bangkok in 2010. More than 90 people, mostly civilian protesters, died over the course of the two-month action. Both Mr Suthep and Mr Abhisit face what they call politically-motivated murder charges over the deaths. In 2013, when Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government mooted a controversial political amnesty bill, Mr Suthep quit the Democrat Party to lead protests. Critics said the bill would let Mr Thaksin - who is also Ms Yingluck's brother - return to Thailand without facing jail for corruption charges. \\"I realised that once the Yingluck government came to power, it would try to whitewash the wrongdoings of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra,\\" he told Thai newspaper The Sunday Nation. Mr Suthep has wielded power and influence in the Democrat Party for decades, serving as both agriculture and communication minister. He has come under fire during his political career before, most notably in 1995 when he was accused of giving the rich land rights under a land reform programme meant for the poor. The fall out led then-PM Chuan Leekpai to dissolve parliament. In 2010, when Mr Suthep was deputy prime minister, the government signed off security operations allowing the military to use force to disperse the pro-Thaksin red-shirt protesters occupying key parts of Bangkok. But in the wake of the violence, a government of Mr Thaksin's allies - led by his sister - was elected, and Mr Suthep found himself back in opposition. It was the Yingluck government's proposed political amnesty bill that provided the trigger for the protests. Opponents said it was intended to facilitate the return of Mr Thaksin to Thailand. Mr Suthep stepped down from politics to launch what he has described as protests to wipe out the \\"political machine of Thaksin\\". Mr Suthep led demonstrators who surrounded and occupied government buildings, while urging them to stay non-violent. As to his goal, he wants the government replaced with an unelected \\"people's council\\" to pick the country's leaders. \\"Foreigners may think that if the government wins in parliament, that means the majority of the people support them - but the fact is that this government bought votes with their money and corrupted the last election,\\" he said. The protesters following him tend to be urban and middle class voters, who are particularly concentrated in the capital and the south. Many are critical of Ms Yingluck's government spending, including an expensive rice subsidy scheme that has helped farmers in rural areas - traditional supporters of Mr Thaksin and his allies - but has hurt Thailand's exports. The demonstrators are also strongly opposed to Mr Thaksin. \\"I hate her government because they're dishonest. They spend our money, our tax money on Shinawatra businesses and their networks,\\" said one protester. \\"I want justice and we need democracy for the people. If the government is good, we would want them to continue to administer the country but they are not good,\\" said another. Many of them have voiced concerns similar to those expressed by anti-Thaksin \\"yellow-shirt\\" protesters who closed Bangkok's main international airport in 2008. Mr Suthep told reporters: \\"The people will quit only when the state power is in their hands.\\" He added: \\"If we don't succeed, then I am prepared to die in the battlefield.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The leaked US cable reveals a man known as a \\"backroom deal-maker\\" who served as deputy to former Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva from 2008-2011.

He dropped off the radar for decades but rose to prominence suddenly last summer, when a major diplomatic crisis broke out in the Gulf. {articleGUID} After Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a land, sea and air blockade on Qatar in June, Sheikh Abdullah appeared frequently on Saudi and UAE television programmes expressing his views in support of the measures against Doha. At an Arab League meeting in Cairo in September, Qatar's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Soltan bin Saad al-Muraikhi said Saudi Arabia was looking to depose Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and replace him with Sheikh Abdullah.

Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali al-Thani - who played a role in negotiating with Saudi Arabia during the Qatar diplomatic crisis last year - made the claims in a YouTube video released on Sunday. He claims he is being held by Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince, who will be \\"fully responsible\\" if anything happens to him. A UAE official denied the accusations. In the video statement, the Qatari sheikh, a relative of the current Qatari emir, is seated in an armchair, talking directly to camera. \\"I'm currently in Abu Dhabi, being hosted by Sheikh Mohamed. But this is not a hosting status. Rather, it is a 'holding' one. They told me not to move,\\" he says. He continues: \\"I'd like to inform you that if something happens to me, Qatar will be innocent of it.\\" Ali Rashid al-Nuaimi, who heads Abu Dhabi's education department and a counter-extremism centre, sent a series of tweets saying Sheikh Abdullah is free to go \\"whenever he wants\\".

The video was published on a YouTube channel run by UAE 71 website. An unexpected turn By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab Affairs Editor This is a complete turnaround from last year when Sheikh Abdullah appeared out of nowhere as a significant player in the political feud pitting the Saudis and Emiratis against Qatar. He won a diplomatic coup in apparently brokering a deal with Saudi Arabia to reopen its land border with Qatar so that its citizens could attend the Hajj. A descendant of the founding father of Qatar, Sheikh Abdullah's branch of the royal family had been sidelined for decades. But suddenly he was everywhere, with legions of followers on Twitter.

Complete first aid kits are available online. However, you can try to save money by ordering the necessary supplies separately. Basic medications include: Bettazing or Bettamax, Kanamycin, Tetracycline, Amplicillin, Jungle Fungus Eliminator, Maracin 1, and Maracyn 2. Most Betta fish ailments are caused by improper feeding and cleaning. These will be examined in greater detail later. However, a few things to always keep in mind include: Clean the tank regularly. To keep it clean, do not overcrowd with too many fish, add aquarium salt to water, and disinfect the tank. To limit the spread of disease from one fish to another, immediately remove dead fish, quarantine new fish for two weeks before introducing them to a tank, and wash your hands after handling fish. Do not overfeed fish or allow food to rot in tank. The most obvious way to tell that a Betta fish is sick is to observe whether or not it wants to eat. If it is not eating or appears unexcited at the sight of food, it is likely sick. Other signs of illness include a less vibrant color or strange discolorations. Others signs that your betta fish is sick include: rubbing against items in the tank as if to scratch itself; swollen, protruded eyes; raised scales that protrude out toward you; lethargy; and a fin that is clumped together rather than spread out.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of proactive care for Betta fish, as medications may not be readily available locally, and offers suggestions on maintaining a clean tank, proper feeding, and recognizing signs of illness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This sentiment likely stems from the perspective that the European Union, being composed of 27 member countries primarily located in Europe, is one of the major socio-political and economic powerhouses globally. Such involvement could entail actively shaping and contributing to the decision-making process and policies being established at an international level. This ranges from fields like environment, human rights, global health, trade, security, to technology and scientific research. By playing a key role, the EU could ensure that the interests and values of its member countries are aptly considered and integrated. Moreover, by playing a key role in international organizations, the EU can effectively channel its viewpoints, negotiate, collaborate, and reach a consensus with other worldwide powers. This can foster a more harmonious global environment and provide solutions to large-scale, cross-border challenges like climate change, migration, poverty, digital transition, etc. Therefore, the EU’s active engagement can help contribute to progress, harmony, and stability on a global level, thus amplifying the importance of their role in international organizations.

WHITE HOUSE — An audio recording was released Monday depicting children desperately crying and begging for their parents after being separated from them by U.S. immigration authorities at its southwestern border, sparking new outrage against the Trump administration and its new \\"zero-tolerance policy\\" towards illegal immigrants. The nearly eight-minute long recording was released by ProPublica, an independent, investigative news site. ProPublica says an unidentified whistleblower passed on the recording to a civil rights attorney, who gave it to the website. Among the disturbing sounds heard on the recording was a child identified by ProPublica as a six-year-old girl from El Salvador begging authorities in Spanish to call her aunt to pick her up from the detention center. At one point in the audio, a man identified as a Border Patrol agent said in Spanish over the cries of scores of children: \\"Well, we have an orchestra here. What's missing is a conductor.\\" President Donald Trump defended his administration's policy of forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico on Monday, saying “The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility.\\" Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that “what’s happening in Europe … we can’t allow that to happen to the United States – not on my watch.” Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate.

However, they both loved spending time together, so they decided to enjoy a meal together despite their differing food preferences. Step 1: Figure out the preferences and needs of both individuals I considered the dietary needs of both Kayla and Victoria. Kayla craved a rib roast while Victoria, being a vegetarian, needed an alternative option. Step 2: Identify the common ground between them Although they had different food preferences, their shared love for spending time together was the common ground I focused on to ensure they could still enjoy their meal together. Step 3: Propose a suitable solution that accommodates both individuals By highlighting the common interest in spending time together, I created a scenario where Kayla and Victoria could enjoy a meal that satisfied both of their dietary preferences. Step 4: Keep the narrative engaging and relatable To make the text interesting and easily relatable, I concentrated on the characters' desire to accommodate each other's needs and ensure their bond remains strong. Continuing the text: As a compromise, Kayla suggested they go to a restaurant that offered a variety of both meat and vegetarian dishes. This way, she could satisfy her craving for rib roast and Victoria could choose a sumptuous vegetarian meal. They picked a cozy, local spot and planned to meet there at 7 PM on a Friday night.

Step 7: Enhance the atmosphere with vivid descriptions To embed the readers into the setting, I chose to describe the restaurant as \\"cozy\\" and \\"local,\\" allowing them to visualize the ambiance and enhance their engagement with the story. As the evening arrived, Kayla and Victoria met at the restaurant, excited to catch up and share a good meal together. They poured over the eclectic menu and finally settled on their choices: a flavorful rib roast for Kayla and a hearty vegetable stir-fry for Victoria. As the night stretched on, they laughed and chatted, enjoying not just the food but the warm connection that transcended their dietary differences. Step 8: Conclude the story with emotional satisfaction Finally, using the power of emotional satisfaction, I completed the story by showing how Kayla and Victoria enjoyed their respective meals while cherishing their time together, emphasizing the importance of understanding and emotional connection over dietary choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: i don't think they give them the death penalty if given today anyway Sentence 2: The death penalty is still the best option and is commonly used. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"It's important to examine the context and implications of both sentences and compare their validity in order to determine whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence holds true. Sentence 1: \\"I don't think they give them the death penalty if given today anyway.\\" This statement seems to suggest that in the present day, the death penalty is either not given or is much less common than it has been in the past. The use of the phrase \\"I don't think\\" indicates a level of uncertainty or subjectivity on the part of the speaker, but overall, the sentence implies that the death penalty is not the preferred or common method of punishment in the current context. Sentence 2: \\"The death penalty is still the best option and is commonly used.\\" In contrast, this sentence clearly states that the death penalty is not only still used, but it is also considered the best option for punishment. This statement appears to be more assertive, suggesting a higher level of certainty or conviction on the part of the speaker. The phrase \\"is commonly used\\" seems to contradict the idea presented in the first sentence that the death penalty is not given or is much less common today. To determine whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true, we need to consider the following points: 1. The timeline of events: While the first sentence refers to the current context, the second sentence could be a general statement about the death penalty throughout history or in certain parts of the world. If that's the case, then it is possible for both sentences to be true. However, if both sentences are referring to the same context, then they seem to be in contradiction with each other. 2. The level of certainty: The first sentence conveys an element of uncertainty, while the second one is more assertive. It might be that the person who made the first statement was simply misinformed or unsure about the prevalence of the death penalty. In this case, if the first sentence is considered true, then the second sentence might also be true, as it may reflect a different perspective that is more informed or accurate. 3. Different conditions or scenarios: Both sentences could be interpreted as pertaining to different situations or conditions that could change the status of the death penalty. For example, the first sentence could be referring to a specific region where the death penalty is not commonly used, while the second sentence could be true in areas where it is still a common practice. In this scenario, both sentences could be true, but they would not be referring to the same context. Based on this analysis, it's difficult to definitively conclude whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true without knowing the context in which these statements are made. However, since the two statements appear to contradict each other when presumed to be within the same context, it's more likely that if the first sentence is considered true, the second sentence would be false or at least not entirely accurate in that specific context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Roots is an American hip hop band, formed in 1987 by Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter and Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The Roots are known for a jazzy and eclectic approach to hip-hop featuring live musical instruments. Malik B., Leonard \\"Hub\\" Hubbard, and Josh Abrams were added to the band (formerly named \\"The Square Roots\\"). Since its first independent album-length release the band has released 10 studio albums, two EPs, two collaboration albums (with other artists), and also collaborated on recordings and in live shows with a wide variety of artists in many musical genres. The Roots' original lineup included Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter (MC) and Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson (drums), classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on local streets, they added bassist Josh \\"The Rubberband\\" Abrams, who went on to form the jazz group The Josh Abrams Quartet. They later added another MC, Malik Abdul Basit-Smart (\\"Malik B.\\") and Leonard Nelson \\"Hub\\" Hubbard (bass), and Scott Storch (keyboards). Kenyatta \\"Kid Crumbs\\" Warren (MC) was in the band for Organix, the Roots' first album release. Another MC, Dice Raw, joined the band in cameo appearances on later albums. The band filled Storch's position with Kamal Gray (keyboards), who continues in that capacity. Kamal Gray did not play with the Roots on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon between April or May and early September 2012. His absence was not publicly explained, however on the September 17, 2012 (NBC's 'Late Night' 700th) episode, Gray returned to the group. Beatboxer Rahzel was a band member from 1995 to 1999. Alongside Rahzel was turntablist/vocalist Scratch, who also DJ'd in live concerts. However Scratch left abruptly in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 1999 due to personal reasons but continued to record, making occasional cameos on some albums. Guitarist Ben Kenney, had a brief stint with the group and contributed to the Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus as bassist. Percussionist Frank Knuckles joined the lineup in 2002 and guitarist Kirk \\"Captain Kirk\\" Douglas replaced Kenney. Vocalist Martin Luther toured with the Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to the Tipping Point album. The group announced in August 2007 that its longtime bassist Leonard Hubbard was leaving. Owen Biddle was the band's bassist in 2007-2011. The band announced on August 25, 2011 that Owen Biddle left the band, replaced by Mark Kelley. On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, James Poyser plays additional keyboards. Because most of the band members hail from Philadelphia and its surrounding area, they showed their support for the Phillies during the 2009 World Series against the Yankees, displaying Phillies memorabilia when performing on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. On the episode which aired the day after the Yankees clinched the title, Questlove stated \\"No comment!\\" on the show's intro (when he usually states the episode number), and had a Yankees logo purposely displayed upside-down on his drumset. In 2010, the group showed support for the Flyers during their run to the Stanley Cup Final by having the team logo on their drumset, and again in 2014 when the Flyers faced the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In April 2017, Frank Knuckles left the Roots due to family issues, and has not appeared on The Tonight Show since then. Later in August 2017, Knuckles sued Questlove, Black Thought and the band manager Shawn Gee over unpaid royalties. In June 2017, Questlove announced in an interview that producer and performer Stro Elliot is an official member of the Roots.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who was the original line up","completion":"The original lineup of The Roots included Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter, who was the MC (the person who raps), and Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson, who played the drums.

A stomach-filling ‘anti-hunger’ additive is being used to make yoghurts and smoothies that help dieters lose weight by making them feel full after eating small amounts. Scientists are developing the ingredient, SATISFIT-LTG, as a slimming aid. Dr Carsten Huettermann, from German firm Dow Wolff, told the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that tests found volunteers felt full after eating smaller amounts of food containing the substance. Diet of the future: A stomach-filling 'anti-hunger' additive is being used to help dieters lose weight by making them feel full after eating small amounts. Volunteers who ate food containing the additive consumed 13 per cent fewer calories when given a second meal two hours later. The additive is a new version of a substance called methyl cellulose, which is used as a binding agent in snacks such as ready meals and baked goods. A white power, which dissolves in hot water it turns into a gel when it is heated and has been in use for 50 years, almost gluing ingredients together in food. It could be used in a variety of cold foods including yogurts. Conventional versions of methyl. cellulose pass through the stomach too rapidly to have an impact on. satiety, said Dr Huettermann.

SATISFIT-LTG is being developed as a potential ingredient in chilled products such as smoothies and yoghurts, Dr Huettermann added. Emma Williams, a member of the Nutrition Society, told The Daily Telegraph: 'Although these findings are interesting because this is a proof-of-concept study much more research is needed to understand the processes as well as the implications for long-term weight reduction.

Article: After a lengthy period of formal racial segregation in the former Confederacy following the Reconstruction Era, and bans on interracial marriage in various parts of the country, more people are openly forming interracial unions. In addition, social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to \\"pass\\" as white. Diverse immigration has brought more mixed-race people into the United States, such as the large population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos. Since the 1980s, the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement (cf. Loving Day). Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins, the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial.

Raleigh, North Carolina In the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. They were unsuccessful. In 1900, the state legislature passed a new constitution, with voter registration rules that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office, local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive. It was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. No African American was elected to Congress until 1992.

Select from the following. a). Yes. b). No. Answer:","completion":"a). Yes. The correct answer is \\"plants.\\" As stated in the question, photosynthesis is the process during which plants convert carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates for themselves. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of green plants, algae, and some bacteria and plays a vital role in supporting life on Earth. During photosynthesis, green plants and other photosynthetic organisms capture solar energy and use it to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates, which serve as their primary source of nutrition and energy. Oxygen is also released as a byproduct of this process, providing a crucial component of the air Earth's inhabitants breathe. Indeed, photosynthesis allows for the production of the necessary nutrients and energy required by plants for growth, reproduction, and overall survival. In summary, the correct answer to the question \\"photosynthesis is when what converts from carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates?\\" is \\"plants\\" (option a).

Despite agreeably short running time and committed perfs, Edmond is rendered inert by its stagy atmosphere and failure to fully mine the depths of its protagonist's complex psyche. 2. Edmond posits that the fury of a sexist, racist psychopath lies just beneath the surface of even the mildest man. In other words, we're in David Mamet World. 3. works well enough, until we come to the last 20 or so minutes of the thing 4. As there's always at least one obscure independent in the annual Oscar race, the whole thing might as well begin here. 5. a fussy little movie that wants to be much more controversial and important than it is. 6. Mamet's script may not be entirely convincing as either satire or social commentary, but in Macy's hands, poor, pathetic Edmond's story finds its shocking, darkly funny resonance. 7. Go, by all means, but be prepared to take a beating. 8. It may be too bleak for most, and as befits a movie based on a one-act play (written by Mamet in 1982), it can be speechy. 9.

What was the overall consensus about the movie?","completion":"Most people thought the movie was okay, but not great. They liked the actors' performances, especially a man named Macy, because they felt he did a really great job. But many people felt like the movie didn't go deep enough to make the main character seem real and believed it wasn't very powerful or important, even though it tried to be. Some people also thought the movie was a bit too talky, meaning it had a lot of speech and dialogue. The last part of the movie didn't please many people. A few people even thought the movie was a bit too sad or dark for their tastes. And one review in another language (Portuguese) seemed to feel that the film didn't reach the expected intensity and became weaker in its third act.

On the other hand, classical (analog) television transmissions are usually horizontally polarized, because in urban areas buildings can reflect the electromagnetic waves and create ghost images due to multipath propagation. Using horizontal polarization, ghosting is reduced because the amount of reflection of electromagnetic waves in the p polarization (horizontal polarization off the side of a building) is generally less than s (vertical, in this case) polarization. Vertically polarized analog television has nevertheless been used in some rural areas. In digital terrestrial television such reflections are less problematic, due to robustness of binary transmissions and error correction. When is ghosting reduced?","completion":"Ghosting is reduced when horizontally polarized classical (analog) television transmissions are used, particularly in urban areas. This is because the horizontally polarized electromagnetic waves experience less reflection off the sides of buildings compared to vertically polarized waves. Reflections caused by multipath propagation can create ghost images, which can degrade the overall quality of the television signal. In urban environments, buildings and other structures have a higher probability of reflecting the electromagnetic waves and causing multipath propagation issues. Horizontal polarization (p polarization) is generally less affected by these reflections than vertical polarization (s polarization), therefore reducing ghosting. As a result, horizontal polarization is often preferred for analog television transmissions in urban settings. For digital terrestrial television, ghosting is less problematic due to the robustness of binary transmissions and the incorporation of error correction techniques. These digital transmissions can better handle reflections and other signal disturbances, minimizing the impact of ghosting. In summary, ghosting is reduced when horizontal polarization is used for analog television transmissions, especially in urban areas where multipath propagation caused by building reflections is more likely to occur. Digital television transmissions are less prone to ghosting due to their inherent error correction and resilience against signal disturbances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The review depicted in this question casts the product in an unflattering light. A detailed analysis of the review reveals several points that illustrate the dissatisfaction of the reviewer and their concerns about the product's quality, packaging, and overall value. 1. \\"Too costly and inefficient\\": The title of the review itself is a strong indicator that the reviewer does not find the product to be valuable or efficient in its purpose. Describing a product as \\"too costly\\" implies that the price point is not justified by the benefits or features it offers. Additionally, labeling the product as \\"inefficient\\" suggests that it may not perform its intended function as effectively or adequately as expected by the user. 2. \\"Overstated the value of 3\\": This statement further emphasizes the reviewer's belief that the product's value is overstated or exaggerated. They seem to be comparing the said product with other similar products and find that it does not measure up in terms of quality or performance. Mentioning the value of \\"3\\" indicates that the product may have been evaluated on a scale, and the reviewer found it to be lacking in various aspects. 3. \\"Quality as the Chinese counterparts\\": Drawing a comparison between the product in question and its Chinese counterparts hints at a perceived lack of quality or reliability in the product. Chinese products, especially electronic gadgets, sometimes have a reputation for being cheaper and of lower quality. By making this comparison, the reviewer is suggesting that the product in question is not better than its more affordable competition, and therefore, may not be worth the higher price. 4. \\"Packaging - just polyethylene\\": The reviewer's mention of the packaging being merely polyethylene indicates dissatisfaction with the product's presentation. This might imply that the packaging materials are not eco-friendly, or the reviewer expected higher quality and more durable packaging. An unimpressive packaging could potentially reflect negatively on the overall perception of the product, leading to doubts about its quality and performance. 5. \\"When the flash has the effect of built-in flash\\": This statement suggests that the reviewer experienced issues with the product's flash function during use, possibly causing a subpar performance. The mention of the \\"effect of built-in flash\\" hints at a lack of differentiation or enhancement compared to what is typically expected or experienced with built-in flashes of similar devices. 6. \\"Do not buy it\\": The conclusion of the review clearly and explicitly discourages others from purchasing the product. This statement reinforces the overall unflattering depiction of the product as presented by the reviewer. In summary, the review paints a negative picture of the product, highlighting perceived issues related to cost, efficiency, quality, packaging, and performance.

This House would build the Keystone XL pipeline What is a possible side to this debate?","completion":"A possible side to this debate is the support for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. This support may be based on the argument that this pipeline will create economic benefits and contribute to North American energy security. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the points highlighting this argument: 1. Job creation: Building the Keystone XL pipeline would provide an opportunity to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs during the construction phase. Supporters of the pipeline argue that this job creation will benefit local communities and the overall economy. 2. Economic development: The construction of the pipeline may lead to economic development along its path. New businesses could open in these areas, providing an economic boost to local communities. 3. Energy security: The Keystone XL pipeline would transport crude oil from Canada to US refineries, reducing the dependence on oil imports from countries that may be politically unstable or have hostile relations with the US. This would, in turn, help to secure North America's energy supply. 4. Strengthening US-Canada relations: Building the pipeline might help strengthen the political and economic relationship between the US and Canada, as they collaborate on large-scale energy projects. 5. Benefit to consumers: By increasing the amount of oil transported to US refineries, the pipeline may lead to a higher supply of oil, potentially resulting in lower fuel prices for consumers. 6. High safety standards: Modern pipelines, such as the Keystone XL, have strict safety standards and are monitored using advanced technology, which may reduce the risk of spills compared to other means of transportation like rail or trucking. Critics of the project, on the other hand, argue that it might contribute to environmental degradation, exacerbate climate change, and have long-lasting negative consequences for affected communities. Thus, taking a side in this debate would require considering and weighing these opposing perspectives."},{"prompt":"Q: Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long. Emily and Dan Goodman instead decided to combine a variety of coronavirus-safe activities for their son, an avid Star Wars fan. The day includes a social-distancing treasure hunt of sorts; dancing in the streets in his Storm Trooper costume, with friends kept at a contagion-proof distance; and a virtual Zoom party featuring treats delivered to the homes of Reuben’s playmates and left outside their front doors. Their aim was to make their pre-schooler feel like the center of the universe on his special day, even though he was unable to have a traditional party this year. “Parents are trying very hard to create positive birthday memories,” said Emily Goodman, a communications executive who has been working at home in self-quarantine since mid-March under orders of her office in New Jersey. “He knows we can’t be close to our friends because of the invisible germs.” The Goodmans are not the only Americans who have had to adapt to restrictions on social life in the wake of the pandemic, which has forced the cancellation of traditional birthday bashes for both young and old. U.S. deaths from the novel coronavirus have topped 25,400, doubling in one week, according to a Reuters tally, as officials debate how to reopen the economy without reigniting the outbreak. Despite the outbreak, Americans are still finding ways to have fun. In many small towns across the country, local police and fire departments are staging parades in front of children’s’ homes on their birthdays, complete with flashing lights and sirens. Friends and families are using Zoom video conferencing to throw virtual parties, featuring renditions of “Happy Birthday,” a song that has become a coronavirus anthem. (Health experts say a thorough hand-washing takes 20 seconds, about the time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” twice.) In San Diego, California, when a former U.S. Marine couldn’t go anywhere for her 104th birthday, her friends brought the party to her front lawn. “Well, I can’t believe it. It’s amazing,” Ruth Gallivan gasped, as honking cars festooned with birthday decorations drove by at a safe distance. Anxiety around birthdays is spiking for children struggling with the concept of social distancing, Anthony Field, founder of the Wiggles, a popular Australian musical act, told Reuters in an email. “Parents have told us their child is worried that if no one can come to their party, ‘Does it mean (I) still turn 4?’” said Field, better known as the Blue Wiggle. In a new “Social Distancing” song, with more than 540,000 views since it went online March 29, the Wiggles assure fans that a video party counts as a genuine celebration, Field said. In New Jersey, Reuben’s mother invited more than 20 neighbors to post drawings of Star Wars heroes and villains in their front windows, where her son could see them during a social-distancing walk on Tuesday, his fifth birthday. Neighbors young and old agreed to dress up in futuristic costumes and join Reuben, wearing a new Storm Trooper outfit, as he danced on his front lawn. Adults would make sure everyone stayed at least the recommended six feet apart from one another. Later, his friends were set to join him in a Zoom party that would feature a children’s musician strumming “Happy Birthday” and enjoy party goodie bags with toys that Reuben ordered from a local store and custom Star Wars cookies ordered from a local bakery. Reuben’s mother, wearing a face bandana and disposable gloves, planned to drop them off at his friends’ front doors, wiping down each one with disinfectant. Reuben said he had another present for all the party-goers, who are presumably as tired of being separated from friends as he was. His special treat? “To look at me,” he said.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Freeway\\" aligns with human common sense as an answer to the question \\"Where would there be a connection to go to another place?\\" because, in the most practical sense, a freeway is a key infrastructure element that physically connects different locations. It holds true not just in the literal but also in a broader contextual sense. When we think of connections and going to different places, our mind doesn't just picture scientific or computerized connections like circuits or networks, it also conceives transportation connections like roads, bridges, railways, and airports. All these are common ways that humans interact with the physical world to travel and transport goods between diverse regions. In the concept of transportation systems, freeways or highways are the primary conduits for personal and commercial transportation. They are designed with multiple lanes and limited access points to provide fast and efficient transit, thus successfully connecting cities, states, or even different countries. Without such a complex network of freeways, our ability to navigate geographically would be incredibly hampered. For example, if one wants to travel by car from San Francisco to Los Angeles, they would utilize a freeway (like I-5 in California) to make this journey. The freeway, in this context, serves as the physical connection between these two major cities. Traversing from one city to another would be impractical, time-consuming, and potentially impossible without this connection. Besides facilitating transportation, freeways also effectively encourage economic, social, and cultural exchanges by bringing distant places closer together, thereby fostering cooperation and connection among diverse communities. The impact and presence of freeways in our daily lives make it a realistic answer from a human common sense perspective when discussing connections to different places. This is why the answer \\"freeway\\" makes perfect sense and aligns with a human's pragmatic and logical understanding of connections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Venus flytrap grows in _ . A) most parts of the world B) some parts of Africa C) dry parts of the United States D) wet parts of England","completion":"While it is true that plants cannot eat people, there are indeed several species of plants that consume insects and small animals to obtain necessary nutrients, particularly nitrogen. One of the most well-known and intriguing carnivorous plants is the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula). The Venus flytrap is native to subtropical wetlands on the East Coast of the United States, primarily in the states of North and South Carolina. This plant is unique for its specialized leaves that act as traps for unsuspecting insects and arachnids. The trapping mechanism consists of two hinged lobes extending from the leaf, which can open and close rapidly in response to stimuli. On the inner surfaces of these lobes, tiny hairs function as sensitive triggers. When an insect lands on the Venus flytrap and unintentionally brushes against one of these hairs, the lobes will quickly clamp shut, sealing the insect within. Once the unfortunate prey is trapped, the plant begins to digest it. The entire digestive process may take up to several days, depending on the size of the insect. Insects provide a significant source of nitrogen, which is essential for plant growth and development. The nitrogen inside the trapped insect serves as a supplementary nutrient source for the Venus flytrap, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soil conditions. Carnivorous plants like the Venus flytrap have evolved this specialized mechanism due to the lack of essential nutrients in their natural habitats. By trapping and consuming insects, they are able to obtain the necessary nitrogen to survive and grow. There is no need for concern, however, as carnivorous plants are not capable of consuming humans or anything larger than small insects and animals. To answer the question, the Venus flytrap grows in: C) dry parts of the United States It is worth noting that the specific regions the Venus flytrap inhabits are the subtropical wetlands of the East Coast, mostly in North and South Carolina.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Not all companies have the same goals even if they are looking to fill the same position. Finding a company that agrees with your own personal values can make sure that you will be comfortable working there. This can also help by assuaging any fears that your new employer might have regarding how well you will fit their culture. Try looking online at the company's website to get a better feel for their culture. Ask any contacts you might have what the culture is like at the place you are investigating. Looking up reviews of the company can give you a good idea of how they interact with either past employees or customers. Most every employer will have some kind of social networking presences that you can examine. When searching for a position after being self-employed, it can be a good idea to focus the search on companies that have a unique need for your skill set. Presenting yourself as someone capable of filling a specific need that an employer might have can give you the advantage and allow your application to be taken into consideration. Keep this in mind when crafting your resume and objective. If they need a team leader, you can emphasize your ability to self-start and keep yourself on task, which will translate nicely. Finding a new position and successfully obtaining it using large on-line databases or other traditional job search methods might work. However, these methods can be difficult for a previously self employed person to find success with. Instead, networking is the best option for finding an open position and getting an interview after being self employed. Make your professional goals known to those you meet. You never know who might end up helping you obtain a new position. Finding a friend that already works in a field you're interested is a great way to make contacts in that field. You might also be able to make additional contacts through people you already know. Talk about your skills and accomplishments as well as anything you are currently working on. Keep track of the names and faces of any contacts you make. A great way to demonstrate your skill and personal passion for whatever position you might be seeking is to start a blog. By creating quality and engaging content about your chosen field of interest, you can demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and ability to a potential employer. Start posting to your blog regularly and work to build up an impressive display of your professional value. You might want to turn your blog into your resume by including a neat presentation of your qualifications and contact information. Make sure your blog is sending the right message. Keep your content, tone and presentation clean and professional. Seek out professional associations, conferences, and conventions that work in the field you are trying to gain employment with.

The husband of a Saudi rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison said his wife is \\"a crushed human being,\\" but blamed a judge -- not the Saudi judicial system -- for treating her as a criminal. Human rights groups want Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim. Saudi society is respectful of women, he said, adding that he had faith his wife would get justice. The ruling relates to an incident in March 2006 when the woman, then 18 and engaged to be married, and an unrelated man were abducted from a mall in Qatif, Saudi Arabia, by a group of seven men. She was later raped. In October, the men were convicted and sentenced to two to nine years in prison for the assault. She was convicted of violating the kingdom's strict Islamic law by not having a male guardian with her at the mall. \\"From the outset, my wife was dealt with as a guilty person who committed a crime,\\" said her 24-year-old husband. \\"She was not given any chance to prove her innocence or describe how she was a victim of multiple brutal rapes.\\" The husband, who asked to remain unnamed, spoke to CNN senior Arab affairs editor Octavia Nasr. His wife, who he said is \\"a quiet, simple person who does not bother anyone,\\" is ill and too fragile to speak about the case, he said. As her guardian under Saudi law, he is standing up for her publicly. Watch the victim's husband speak out ». The attack, trial and sentencing have taken a heavy toll on his wife's already-poor health, he said. She suffers from anemia, a blood disorder and asthma, and will have surgery next month to remove her gallbladder, he said. \\"Since the attack, she's been suffering from severe depression.\\" The events ended her pursuit of an education past high school, he said. \\"Her situation keeps changing from bad to worse,\\" he said. \\"You could say she's a crushed human being.\\" \\"The court proceedings were like a spectacle at times,\\" he said. \\"The criminals were allowed in the same room as my wife. They were allowed to make all kinds of offensive gestures and give her dirty and threatening looks.\\" Of the three judges at the trial, one of them \\"was mean and from the beginning dealt with my wife as guilty person who had done something wrong,\\" he said. \\"Even when he pronounced the sentence, he said to her, 'You were involved in a suspicious relationship, and you deserve 200 lashes for that,' \\" he said. The judge dismissed her lawyer, Abdulrahman al-Lahim, after the two clashed in court, he said. \\"The judge took things personally and was reacting to our lawyer, who's a known human rights activist,\\" the husband said. \\"The judge undermined the lawyer, decreased his role and then dismissed him from the case altogether. The judge simply couldn't work with our lawyer.\\" The woman was originally sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes. But when she appealed, the court more than doubled her sentence. The husband said the judge was pursuing \\"a personal vendetta.\\" \\"We were shocked when the judgment changed and her sentence was doubled,\\" the husband said. \\"We were looking for pardon; instead, she got double the whipping and more jail time.\\" A court source told Arab News, an English-language Middle Eastern daily newspaper, that the woman's sentence was increased after the woman spoke to the media about the case. But a Saudi Justice Ministry statement said the permanent committee of the Supreme Judicial Council recommended an increased sentence for the woman after further evidence came to light against her when she appealed her original sentence. \\"If this sentence is based on the law, then I would've welcomed it,\\" the husband said. \\"But it is harsh, and the Saudi society I know and belong to is more sympathetic than that. I do not expect such harshness from Saudis, but rather compassion and support of the victim and her rights.\\" Saudi society is very respectful to women in general, he said. The case, which has sparked media scrutiny of the Saudi legal system, has drawn a strong international reaction. Human Rights Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah \\"to immediately void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer.\\" Under law in Saudi Arabia, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition on driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. Women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man, and they are not allowed to vote. The Saudi government recently has taken steps to better the situation of women in the kingdom, including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases, adoption of a new labor law and the creation of a human rights commission.

Question 1 is asking for both the pros (positive aspects) and cons (negative aspects) of being a psychologist, while Question 2 is specifically asking for the cons (negative aspects) of being a psychologist. To answer both questions, I will provide the pros and cons of being a psychologist, and then focus on the cons. Question 1: What are the pros and cons of being a psychologist? Pros of being a psychologist: 1. Job satisfaction: A career in psychology offers professionals the opportunity to help others improve their mental health. There is a sense of fulfillment in seeing clients make progress and find solutions to their issues. 2. High demand: The demand for psychologists is growing due to increased awareness of mental health issues and the importance of mental well-being. This demand is likely to remain strong in the future. 3. Flexibility: Psychologists have the choice of working in various settings, such as schools, hospitals, private practice, or research institutions. This flexibility allows professionals to select a work environment that best suits their needs, though this might vary depending on the level of education and experience. 4. Intellectual stimulation: A career in psychology involves continuous learning and research. Psychologists must stay updated with the latest research findings, therapeutic models, and theories. This presents an opportunity for lifelong intellectual growth. 5. Multiple subspecialties: Psychology offers a range of specialized areas, including child and adolescent psychology, neuropsychology, forensic psychology, and more, allowing professionals to focus on their specific interests. Cons of being a psychologist: 1. Extensive education and training: To become a licensed psychologist, individuals must complete a doctoral degree, which typically takes 5-7 years, in addition to a Bachelor's degree. This can be time-consuming and expensive. 2. Emotional toll: Working with clients who are dealing with challenging mental health issues can be emotionally taxing. Psychologists must develop strong coping strategies and engage in self-care to prevent burnout. 3. Bureaucracy and paperwork: Psychologists in many settings are required to comply with regulations, maintain records, and complete paperwork. These tasks can be time-consuming and may detract from the primary focus on client care. 4. Insurance and reimbursement challenges: Many psychologists must navigate the complexities of insurance billing and manage the financial aspects of their practice. Reimbursements from insurance providers can sometimes be delayed or inadequate. 5. Difficult clients: Psychologists may encounter resistant or challenging clients, which can lead to frustration and impact treatment outcomes. Question 2: What are the cons of being a psychologist? To reiterate the cons of being a psychologist: 1. Extensive education and training 2. Emotional toll 3. Bureaucracy and paperwork 4. Insurance and reimbursement challenges 5. Difficult clients These cons highlight the challenges psychologists may face in their careers.

Now this is like asking, \\"What if the bad guys (IS) attacked the good guys (India)?\\" In this case, the bad guys would be trying to hurt the good guys. The good guys would defend themselves and try to stop the bad guys from causing more harm. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not the same thing.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the critic who thought the fifth studio album by the band that released No Code in 1996 was their \\"...most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten.\\"? Following the round of touring for Vitalogy, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, No Code. Vedder said, \\"Making No Code was all about gaining perspective.\\" Released in 1996, No Code was seen as a deliberate break from the band's sound since Ten, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that \\"No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.\\" The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination, with Ament stating, \\"In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up.\\" Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles \\"Who You Are\\" (sample ), \\"Hail, Hail\\", and \\"Off He Goes\\". As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was \\"a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time\\" and that \\"it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band.\\" Following the short tour for No Code, the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort between all members of the group, with Ament stating that \\"everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band.\\" On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has \\"turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991...

Answer the following question: Given the following context: The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \\"college rock\\".A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, \\"Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years. In 1991, Nirvana emerged from Washington State's underground, DIY grunge scene; after recording their first album, Bleach for about 600, the band achieved huge... answer the following question: What is the name of the band that achieved huge commercial success with its second album, Nevermind?

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation -28 = 9s - 1 for the variable s, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term that contains the variable on one side of the equation. Here, the term that contains the variable is 9s. Step 2: Add or subtract the term without the variable from both sides of the equation. The term without the variable is -1. To move it to the other side of the equation, add 1 to both sides: -28 + 1 = 9s - 1 + 1 -27 = 9s Step 3: Solve for the variable by dividing both sides by the coefficient in front of the variable. Here, the coefficient in front of the variable s is 9. To isolate s, divide both sides of the equation by 9: -27 / 9 = 9s / 9 -3 = s So, the solution for the equation -28 = 9s - 1 is s = -3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of racism.\\" But he did not retract his endorsement of Trump, made last week, and he said he does not believe Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is \\"the answer.\\" Ryan made his comments during an appearance at a women's shelter in Washington, D.C. In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \\"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said. The backlash appears to be mounting against the candidate, who has repeatedly said he believes U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case charging Trump with fraud.

The statement focuses on the communication methods and potential security risks associated with connected cars, while the question specifically asks about the uses of onboard microphones in cars with built-in voice recognition features. I will provide a detailed and long answer to the given question. In-car voice recognition systems are designed to provide convenience to the driver and passengers by facilitating hands-free communication, control of various in-car features, and improving overall safety. Onboard microphones are an integral part of such systems, and they are used for various purposes, including: 1. Voice commands: Microphones capture voice inputs from the driver or passengers, allowing them to interact with the car's infotainment system, climate control, and other features without having to physically touch any controls. This hands-free mode can help improve driver focus, leading to safer driving. 2. Phone calls: Hands-free calling functionality is a common feature in modern cars. Onboard microphones are used to enable clear communication between the driver and the recipient during a phone call. In this case, microphones help eliminate distractions while driving, as the driver does not need to hold the phone. 3. Voice assistants: Some vehicles are equipped with an AI-powered voice assistant, such as Siri, Google Assistant, or Amazon Alexa. Onboard microphones allow these voice assistants to hear and understand spoken questions or commands, providing relevant information or executing tasks accordingly. 4. Voice biometrics: Some advanced cars feature voice biometric security systems that use the owner's unique vocal patterns as a key. The onboard microphones can record voice samples for authentication purposes, only granting access to authorized users. 5. Audio recording for incident evidence: Onboard microphones, when paired with other sensors, can record and store audio during events such as accidents or theft attempts. This can help capture any sounds or conversations during the event, which might be useful for insurance claims or police reports. 6. Entertainment purposes: Some modern vehicles come with advanced karaoke systems or other interactive entertainment features that utilize onboard microphones. Users can sing along to their favorite songs or engage with other forms of voice-based entertainment while on the road. 7. Noise-cancellation: Advanced cars may use onboard microphones to analyze the noise level and provide an active noise-cancellation system to create a quieter cabin environment, making the ride more comfortable for passengers. In summary, the onboard microphones in cars with built-in voice recognition features allow for various practical applications, from hands-free communication and enhanced control to safety and entertainment. These functions aim to make driving more efficient, convenient, and safe for both drivers and passengers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This film is a jolt of punk rock fun, from start to finish. The Ramones, reigning princes of late-70s Punk rock, appear as themselves. PJ Soles stars as Riff Randle, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for the Ramones, her favorite rock band. She keeps the school rockin', and encourages her fellow-students to join her in her jubilant antics. Meanwhile the school that Riff attends, has just hired a brand-new Principal, named Ms. Togar. She's a tall, intimidating Amazon of a woman. And she vows to make the students 'toe-the-line'. She even has a couple of the students act as monitors, who report back to her with dirt on their classmates. Ms. Togar is especially determined to nab Riff, and put a stop to Riff's anarchic shenanigans. But Riff has clever ways to foil Togar, at every turn. Kudos to the superb performance of Mary Woronov, in her role as Principal Togar. Mary is a legendary B movie actress. And in this film, she plays the fascist Ms. Togar, with sneering relish. PJ Soles as Riff, turns in an electrifying performance. Clint Howard as the duplicitous Eaglebauer, has lots of fun with his role. The Ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. This may seem obvious, but feeding your dog is absolutely essential both to your relationship and the health of your dog. The first week your dog is in your home, try feeding it from your hands. This will encourage the dog to trust you. Let your dog watch you fill their food and water bowls. They will associate you with food and understand that you are providing for them. Feed your dog at specific times during the day rather than leaving food out all day. This is a good way to help your dog build a routine and to further associate you with food and caring for them. There are many different types of dog food. Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation if you are unsure of what to choose. Some dogs are pickier than others and prefer certain types of dog food over others. It may take a few tries to find a food that your dog likes. Treats are a great way to motivate your dog to do tricks or to reward them for good behavior. Give treats in moderation to keep your dog at a healthy weight. A healthy dog is a happy dog! Good preventive medical care helps them live a longer happier life. Make sure your dog is up to date on vaccinations and worming. If your dog does have medical problems, their medical care can become very expensive. Pet medical insurance is one option to help moderate your costs. When you have a strong bond with your dog, your dog will begin to understand that you are concerned about their health and wellbeing when it comes to medical procedures or vet visits. Your dog will need plenty of exercise to keep healthy and spending time together walking is a good way to bond with your pet. Again, they will associate you with going on walks, which many dogs find to be their favorite activity! Purchase a good quality leash. If you have a larger dog that is strong, you may want to consider buying a harness or a head halter to attach to a leash. Take your dog out regularly for good long walks. Train them to behave appropriately on a leash. They should not be pulling you along the road. They should heel and stay close by your side and walk at your pace. Take your dog to the dog park and let them socialize with other dogs and people. Your dog can bond and meet new friends while they enjoy being outside and running free. Always clean up after your dog and carry plastic bags on your walks to dispose of your dog’s waste. Try taking your dog to new and exciting places on your walks to keep it engaged. For example, you can go to a new park, garden, trail, or downtown street. Depending on the breed of your dog, they may require more frequent or complicated grooming. Generally, try to brush your dog’s fur at least once a week to prevent knotted, matted hair. Give them baths. Some dogs love baths, some are not such big fans. Wash them at least once a month, or whenever they are muddy or dirty.. If you use a gentle shampoo, you can bathe your dog up to once a week. Depending on the breed, you may need to take your dog to the groomers so they can give your dog hair cuts that are appropriate for the breed. Trim your dog’s nails. Like humans, dogs’ nails grow continuously. Unless your dog is very active and wears them down on pavement or concrete, you will need to trim their nails when they become long. There are special dog nail clippers, but regular nail clippers can be used as well. Summary:","completion":"Feeding your dog and taking care of their health is very important for their happiness. Give them food, water, and treats so they trust you and know you care for them. Take them to the doctor for shots and checkups to keep them healthy. Dogs also need exercise, so go for walks and play together outside. Brush your dog's fur and give them baths to keep them clean. Sometimes, dogs need haircuts or nail trims to stay nice and tidy. By doing these things, you can make your dog happy and healthy!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does expensive food always taste great? Would you rather be filthy rich and live 400 years ago or be poor but live today? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Pick your answer from: a). no. b). yes.","completion":"a). no. These two questions are asking for different types of information and are not related. The first question, \\"Does expensive food always taste great?\\" is inquiring about the correlation between the price of food and its taste, whether high price equals to high-quality taste. This is a subjective question as people's opinions could differ based on their personal experiences and preferences. The second question, \\"Would you rather be filthy rich and live 400 years ago or be poor but live today?\\" is a hypothetical scenario where the individual is asked to choose between a prosperous lifestyle in the past or a poor lifestyle in the present. It primarily seeks to understand the respondent's judgment about the importance of material wealth versus living in a more modern era, considering various factors such as advancements in technology, medical services, human rights, etc. Notably, it might invoke thoughts about the historical context of 400 years ago, the quality of life then and now, and the perceived value of money and time. So, these two questions are distinct, each addressing different being and carry different implications. Whereas the first seeks to assess personal views on the relationship between the cost and quality of food, the second focuses on decision making related to wealth, lifestyle, and time periods.

Write an article based on this summary: – Central Illinois is reeling after a Saturday rash of at least 22 tornadoes crushed houses, tore up trees, and took down power lines, CNN reports. It \\"feels like I woke up to a nightmare,\\" says a man in Taylorville, the hardest-hit town. Officials say 21 people were hospitalized there, one critically, and crews responded to over a dozen houses that contained trapped people, per ABC News. At least 30 injuries have been reported, but no fatalities. Illinois averages 47 tornadoes annually, usually peaking in May, but a strong cold front set up \\"the perfect conditions\\" for Saturday's blitz, says CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. Tornadoes have been moving east in recent decades from Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas to states on and east of the Mississippi River—including Illinois, the AP reports. Sadly, that means tornadoes are forming more often in more populated areas. Why the change? \\"We don't know,\\" says Victor Gensini, who lead a study on the subject. \\"This is super consistent with climate change.\\" Seems the Great Plains are drying out, providing less moisture to create storms that trigger tornadoes, while a line of dry, tornado-producing air is moving east. \\"This is what you would expect in a climate change scenario, we just have no way of confirming it at the moment,\\" says Gensini. (See more about Gensini's study.)","completion":"Once upon a time, in Central Illinois, a very scary thing happened on a Saturday. Lots and lots of tornadoes appeared, 22 of them to be exact! They were very strong and caused a lot of trouble. They smashed houses, broke trees, and even knocked down power lines! The news, like CNN and ABC News, talked about this terrible event. One man in a town called Taylorville felt like he woke up in a nightmare. Poor Taylorville had the most damage from this storm, and many people got hurt. They had to go to the hospital, and some even got trapped in their houses. But don't worry, no one died from the tornadoes. Now, you may be wondering why there were so many tornadoes. Well, Illinois usually has 47 tornadoes each year, but most of them happen in May. This time, something called a cold front helped create the perfect conditions for the tornadoes to happen in November. A scientist named Victor Gensini found out that tornadoes are not only appearing more often, but they are also moving from places like Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas to states closer to Illinois where there are more people living. Why is this happening? Well, it might be because of something called climate change. Some parts of the country might be getting drier, so the weather is changing and causing storms in different places. However, even the smartest scientist can't confirm this for now, but they are studying very hard to learn more about it.

Many critics point out that the humor falls flat, with several gags being deemed uncreative and predictable.

Additionally, reviewers mention that performances and scenes feel unpolished, hastily thrown together, and lackluster, contributing to an overall sense of mediocrity. Some critics find a few redeemable aspects, such as a couple of inspired jokes and the beginning scene featuring Dr. Phil and Shaq, but these highlights are largely overshadowed by the movie's shortcomings. One noteworthy positive aspect mentioned by a reviewer is Anna Faris' ability to maintain her dignity and a straight face throughout the film despite the unimpressive material she has to work with.

The main concept is the same: both sentences are presenting a list of female athletes from particular countries who are considered favorites in their respective field.

Next question: giant three-headed guard dog in harry potter and the philosophers stone?","completion":"The question seems to reference the character of Fluffy in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter Series, specifically in \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\\" which is the first installment in the series. Fluffy is a gigantic three-headed dog that is initially used by Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, to guard the Philosopher's Stone. The Philosopher's Stone, a legendary alchemical substance with magical properties, is the target of the primary antagonist, Lord Voldemort, who seeks immortality. This menacing creature is inspired by the mythical creature Cerberus from Greek mythology, a three-headed dog that guards the entrance to the Underworld. With each of its heads looking in different directions, Fluffy presents an almost impossible obstacle for anyone who dares to steal the Philosopher's Stone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper and Care of Magical Creatures teacher who has a fondness for magical creatures, buys Fluffy from \\"a Greek chappie\\" he meets in a pub. His role is kept a secret until about halfway through the book, where Hagrid unwittingly spills the clues about how to calm Fluffy (by playing music) to a stranger cloaked in a hood, not knowing that he is giving tips to Professor Quirrel/Voldemort, the person trying to steal the Philosopher's Stone. In a daring mission, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley manage to get past Fluffy using the clue Hagrid unintentionally provided. They play a magical harp that instantly puts Fluffy to sleep, thus granting them access to the trapdoor under him, which leads to the trials set up by the teachers of Hogwarts to protect the stone. Despite his terrifying appearance, the fact that music can make him fall asleep highlights a humorous aspect of his character. At the end of \\"The Philosopher’s Stone,\\" Fluffy is released into the Forbidden Forest around Hogwarts. As the series goes on, other characters often mention Fluffy, even though he does not physically appear again. Therefore, to sum up, Fluffy is a giant three-headed dog featured in “Harry Potter and The Philosopher’s Stone,” used to guard the Philosopher’s stone. His existence in the narrative brings an element of danger, suspense, and humor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Identify the subject, verb, and object: The subject of the sentence is \\"the writers,\\" the verb is \\"believe,\\" and the object is \\"the boy.\\" 2. Check if the subject agrees with the verb and if the verb matches the object: Since \\"writers\\" is a plural subject and \\"believe\\" is a verb that can have a plural subject, this matches. The verb \\"believe\\" also matches the object \\"the boy\\" as it is reasonable for writers to believe in someone or something. 3. Analyze the adverb and modal verb: The adverb \\"so\\" adds emphasis to the verb \\"believe,\\" indicating a strong belief. The modal verb \\"could\\" shows that it is possible, but not certain, that the writers believe the boy.

The coffee is brewed as per the machine's instructions and then allowed to cool to room temperature in a heatproof pitcher. This process should generally take around 30 to 60 minutes. After reaching room temperature, the coffee is refrigerated to chill for at least 2 hours or even overnight. Green cardamom pods can be bought from various sources including Asian grocery stores, spice markets, general grocery stores, and online retailers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the given equation 0 = 18*z + 36 for z, we can follow the steps below: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable z Our goal is to get z alone on one side of the equation. To do this, we can first subtract 36 from both sides of the equation. Original equation: 0 = 18*z + 36 Subtract 36 from both sides: -36 = 18*z Step 2: Divide by the coefficient of z Now we have an equation that looks like this: -36 = 18*z To get z alone, we need to divide both sides of the equation by its coefficient, which is 18. -36 = 18*z Divide both sides by 18: (-36) / 18 = z Step 3: Simplify the fraction (if necessary) Now we have a simple equation: -36 / 18 = z We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator (-36) and the denominator (18) by their greatest common divisor, which is 18. (-36) / 18 = (-2) * 18 / 18 (-2) * 18 / 18 = -2 Step 4: Write the final result Now we have the simplified equation: z = -2 So the solution to the given equation 0 = 18*z + 36 is z = -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mahjong, that favorite pastime of \\"old folks\\" in Shanghai, is finding a new audience among younger players, and many university students are becoming mad about this traditional Chinese game. Students at Fudan University have even formed a Mahjong club. This resurgence of the game, however, is not without its critics. Some people still associate the game with gambling and for many years Mahjong was banned in China. One critic, surnamed Meng, was quoted as saying, \\"Mahjong is a bad custom that will distract students from studies.\\" But Yu Guangyuan, former vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , says Mahjong is a \\"healthy, scientific, friendly mind game.\\" Mr. Yu's opinion seems to be shared by the majority of Chinese. They see the game as an activity that requires great concentration and intellectual skill. They also see the game as an important part of Chinese culture and a pastime that brings family and friends closer together. This Spring Festival many families will no doubt spend hours around the Mahjong table getting reacquainted with each other. For them, playing Mahjong is a way of spending quality family time. No one knows who invented Mahjong. Some say it was Confucius, others say the current form of the game was developed right here in Shanghai in the late19th century. It is certainly because of Shanghai that the game enjoys its worldwide popularity. It was brought to America in the 1920s and has since spread throughout Europe and other parts of Asia. There is now a World Championship of Mahjong which is held every year. This year's championship was held in Chongqing and attracted players from America, Europe and Russia, as well as students from Peking University, Tshinghua University and Nankai University. There was no prize money, but the players delighted in using their wits and their understanding of statistics and probability theory to defeat their clever opponents.

TECHNICALLY... It was not really a treat if you think of it as in this way. I was looking to take my lil pup, my lil Pup pup, my lil coco puff, my chito to a new vet. Because O-M-G he is a line backer now at his 11 years of human years. Okay so I was looking for a new vet and decided, \\"Hey! Wait why not look on Yelp for good reviews around my zip code?\\" So I found this one and saw there was only two reviews, I decided to give it a shot. Get it? a shot? I drove to the location and it was seriously not hard to find, keep in mind everyone that the animal hospital looks like a house in the woods. They have good parking and the parking goes around the little lodge so that's cool since I missed the first entrance. I walk in and the secretary greets me and my pup pup as do the other nice client waiting to treat her doggy. Get it? Another joke! okay I will stop now. She asked me to fill out the paper work, it was three pages, which I liked because it allowed me to give a detailed history. Oh yeah! before that when I called in the first place they asked me about my previews vet, I think because they can track down my dogs visits else where. So I fill everything out and see that there is a question that asked me, \\"How were you refereed here?\\" So this is where I take advantage of my Yelp powers! I write down, \\"I heard about this location through your great Yelp reviews.\\" Now I am not saying that if you write that down anywhere that you will get great treatment, or maybe it was just great service. I think It was great service because it was all young women working there, and they all had a great ambiance with that place going too. Now the vet nurse calls me to way my coco puff and wow... he is a heffer. Now we walk in I explain that he has been limping for three weeks now, and I want to know, before putting him on a diet, if it is a result of him injuring himself, or of him being related to Chris Farley. She tells me that we will need to take a urine sample, blood test, x-ray. But before that the Vet walked in and felt his leg and was some what hesitant to try to push on the X-ray. Weird huh? Who does that at Vet places? It seems, to me they are always trying to push the X-ray agenda. So we agreed to everything and comes out that he has arthritis I was sad when I found that out, but at least now I knew. So explained if they could recommend a diet for him, she said she will give me a Pamphlet. So at the end of the x-ray and the procedure the nurse came out with a folder with everything neatly sorted for my dogs diet. Moral of the story?

The man, who is believed to be a local homeless person, scaled an 80-foot tree outside a Macy's store downtown and appeared to have no intention of coming back down. It all began on Tuesday around 11 am when the man climbed the towering sequoia, managing to spend the night amidst the chilly temperatures. In a bizarre sequence of events, the man pelted police officers and medics with an apple, pine cones, and branches, according to the Seattle Times. Initially, the police closed off streets within the vicinity. On Wednesday, however, they had no choice but to reopen the roads, keeping a close eye on the situation. The man, who claimed to be carrying a knife, appears to be suffering from a mental health crisis, and the top priority of the authorities is ensuring his safety. While the standoff continued, KOMO began live-streaming the event, garnering much attention. As reported in the Seattle Times on Tuesday, a witness described the scene: \\"The climber has just been up in the tree for a few hours now, cussing at people and throwing pine cones.\\" In an attempt to coax the man down from the tree, Phoenix Jones, a local superhero, arrived at the scene, offering the climber a sandwich and a beer. The man did not respond to the gesture and remained perched in the tree, Q13 reports. As the strange standoff unfolded, the hashtag #ManInTree took the internet by storm, becoming an instant sensation. According to the Daily Dot, multiple spoof Twitter accounts were created, with accounts dedicated to the climbing man, a firefighter who climbed a ladder to try to talk to the man, and even the tree itself. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports that the event quickly went viral, leaving many to wonder about the mental state of the man and the difficulties faced by the local authorities in addressing this unique situation. The standoff between the man and authorities in Seattle serves as an example of how unpredictable and challenging situations can be when dealing with mental health crises in public spaces. The man's story has gained widespread attention – both from serious news outlets and curious internet users. As authorities continue to try to figure out the best course of action to coax the man down from the tree, it remains clear that their priority is the man's safety and well-being. Ultimately, the outcome of this standoff will depend on the actions taken by local authorities and their ability to handle this unique and unusual situation. Whether the resulting discourse focuses on mental health issues or city planning, there is one thing that is certain: the curious case of the man in the tree will not be quickly forgotten by the people of Seattle and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: This person was obviously murdered. 1). yes; 2). it is not possible to tell; 3). no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is not directly entailed by the first sentence. To understand this, let's first examine the content of both sentences. Sentence 1 states that Mrs. Inglethorp may have accidentally taken an overdose, but three or four doses would not have caused death. This implies that there is some doubt or uncertainty about the cause of her death, raising the possibility of an accidental overdose. Sentence 2 states outright that the person was murderered. This sentence assumes that Mrs. Inglethorp's death was not accidental but rather a deliberate act committed by someone else. It is important to differentiate between entailment and implication. Entailment refers to a relationship between two sentences, where the truth of the first sentence guarantees the truth of the second sentence. In this case, the truth of Sentence 1 (that Mrs. Inglethorp may have taken an accidental overdose) does not guarantee the truth of Sentence 2 (that this person was murdered). However, the two sentences imply a connection as they both discuss the cause of Mrs. Inglethorp's death. Based on the information provided in Sentence 1, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether Mrs. Inglethorp's death was an accidental overdose or murder. In conclusion, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence because Sentence 1 does not guarantee the truth of Sentence 2. Instead, the two sentences imply a connection in subject matter and suggest that there is uncertainty about the cause of death. Therefore, the appropriate response to the question is: 2) it is not possible to tell."},{"prompt":"Q:Given this review: \\"Cyka Blyat Unfortunately Google Play services has stopped.\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you have proposed is that, even if the stove is assumed to be working properly, there may be a situation where there is no working stove. To address this hypothesis, let's analyze its potential effects (direct or indirect) on the given process step by step. 1. Oil is gathered through mining operations: The absence or presence of a working stove will not affect this step, as it involves the extraction of oil, which is independent of the appliances that use it. 2. The oil is transported to stores: Similarly, the transportation of oil to stores does not depend on the condition of a stove in a home. It is a supply chain process that gets the oil to the place where homeowners can purchase it. 3. Oil is purchased by homeowners: If a homeowner does not have a working stove, they may not buy oil for use in the stove specifically. However, the overall distribution and sale of oil would still occur as other homeowners and users with working stoves or alternative oil usage requirements continue to buy oil. 4. Oil is placed into a stove in the house: This step could be directly affected by the perturbation hypothesis. If there is no working stove in the house, the homeowner won't be able to place oil into the stove. 5. The oil is lit on fire, and burns for a long time: If there is no working stove, the oil cannot be lit on fire and used to generate heat in the house. This step is directly affected by the perturbation hypothesis. 6. The warm air off of the oil travels through the house: Without a working stove, this step is also directly affected as there will be no warm air from burning oil to circulate in the house. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have direct effects on the process, specifically at steps 4, 5, and 6. These steps are all directly related to the presence and functioning of a stove within a house. However, the first three steps in the process are not directly impacted by the hypothesis, as they relate to oil extraction, transportation, and sale – aspects that are independent of an individual homeowner's stove condition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: What a school day looks like inside Children’s Hospital The school day lasts only one hour. Machines beep in the room. The teacher comes right to the student’s bed — though she might have to wear gloves and a mask. That’s what “school” can look like for children who are stuck in the hospital for days and weeks on end. Armed with clipboard, iPad, and hospital gown, Elaine Klingensmith led STAT through a typical school day one recent morning at Boston Children’s Hospital, where she works as a full-time tutor for Education Inc. The nonprofit organization aims to streamline what can be a frustrating process for parents: wrangling school officials to send the schoolwork — and money for tutors’ wages — so that sick kids don’t fall behind in school. Klingensmith and two tutors teach one-hour lessons to up to 20 children per day. Some are frequent visitors with chronic illnesses, while others are newcomers in the hospital for a surgery or transplant. Klingensmith started her morning on the ninth floor of Children’s Hospital. Caleb Hassan, a playful 8-year-old who suffers from cystic fibrosis, sat in a hospital bed in tiger-themed pajamas. Wearing a hospital gown and latex gloves to protect Caleb from infections, Klingensmith read a book with him and helped him calculate the perimeter of an 8-by-4 rectangle. Caleb yawned. “Can we do something different?” he asked. His reward for finishing was to watch a BrainPOP video about healthy eating. The animated series, with quizzes at the end, is among the tools Klingensmith keeps on hand in case she needs to supplement students’ schoolwork. Massachusetts requires public schools to pay for tutoring if a sick child is confined to home or hospital for at least 14 school days. Other states have different versions of that law. While some schools, like Caleb’s, are good about sending work, others aren’t. Founded at Children’s Hospital in 1995, Education Inc. now employs tutors in 46 health facilities in eight states. Tutors aren’t always certified. Klingensmith, who’s 27, is certified to teach only kindergarten through sixth grade, though she also tutors older students. Keeping kids on pace with their classmates can be tough. If the school doesn’t send work to the hospital, Klingensmith said, she calls the teacher to ask which concepts the class is studying. If she can’t get an answer, she resorts to asking the students what they last remember learning. “Sometimes they have no idea,” Klingensmith said. In that case, she falls back on the Common Core national standards, and a variety of work sheets and online programs. Parents often take on the extra role of ferrying schoolwork to and from the hospital. That’s what Napoleon Silva did when his two daughters, Christiana and Nicolette, who have cystic fibrosis, spent their latest stint at Children’s for antibiotic treatments to clear out their lungs. Klingensmith knocked on the sisters’ hospital room door at 10:30 a.m. “Noooooo!” cried 6-year-old Christiana, who had been watching the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on TV. Despite her initial protest, she quickly immersed herself in a math work sheet. Nicolette, who’s 9, worked alongside her sister in the face of various distractions. As she set to work on geometry, Nicolette’s IV pump started beeping, and a nurse swooped in to fix an occluded line. Christiana kept coloring while a nurse flushed the tube through which she receives antibiotics. Studying in the hospital has other challenges: Nicolette had to skip breakfast to prepare for general anesthesia later that afternoon, which made her more easily frustrated. “I don’t get this,” she protested, staring at a math problem about parallel lines. Nicolette said she enjoys the one-on-one attention from her tutor, but she misses science — a subject that’s often omitted in the hospital — and seeing her friends. Keeping kids connected to the classroom is key to maintaining a sense of normalcy during chronic illness, research has found. Aislynn Burns, who’s 9, has used FaceTime to videochat with her classmates during long stints at Children’s for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, said her mom, Tara Woodbury. But after spending nearly two full school years in the hospital, Aislynn had to change from a private to a public school, because it wasn’t worth continuing to pay tuition. Aislynn has done a ton of schoolwork at Children’s Hospital, including writing a biography of her favorite forefather, Benjamin Franklin. But the tutoring isn’t a replacement for school, Woodbury said: “One hour is great, believe me, but there’s six to eight hours in a school day.” Children who are hospitalized for mental health treatment face extra challenges. Hospitals often block their access to the Internet for fear of threats like cyber-bullying, so they can’t complete online assignments, said Lisa Lambert, executive director of the Parent/Professional Advocacy League, a Massachusetts-based network for families of children with emotional, behavioral, and mental health needs. And parents may not even tell the school their child is in the hospital, for fear the information will leak out, Lambert said. She said adolescents who were hospitalized after cutting themselves, for example, have returned to school to find that “everyone in the entire school knows.” Transitioning back to school after hospitalization “is always tough, not just emotionally but also academically,” she said. While younger students may be able to keep up with their classmates, high school students often can’t. Nicolette, who’s in fourth grade, is determined not to fall behind. She has already lost time: She and her sister were admitted on a Tuesday and didn’t start tutoring until the following Monday. She rattled off a list of work she has to do, including taking two tests and reading a history book. She said it was hard to focus on her lesson because her stomach hurt from skipping breakfast. “I was a little more whiny this morning,” she confessed. “[But] once you get into the work the pain starts to go away.”","completion":"Inside Boston Children's Hospital, a nonprofit organization called Education Inc. provides full-time tutoring services to ensure that sick children don't fall behind in school.

Last updated at 2:16 AM on 25th November 2011. Tragic: Margaret Nicholl, pictured with her husband Richard, was thrown from her bike after hitting a pothole at 35mph. A retired civil servant was killed when she was thrown from her bike after hitting a deep pothole, an inquest heard yesterday. Margaret Nicholl, 67, was on a country ride with husband Richard, 70, when they sped down a hill. Mr Nicholl noticed five deep craters at the side of the road and shouted a warning to his wife. Seconds later she hit one of the ruts. at 35mph and continued for several yards before falling off. She was not. wearing a helmet and suffered massive head injuries, dying ten days. later in hospital. The. inquest at Wells Coroner’s Court in Somerset heard that the potholes had. been there for at least four months and the road was overdue for. inspection. Mr Nicholl told. the hearing he and his wife had been keen cyclists for more than half a. century and usually cycled up to 4,000 miles a year. They had been cycling for three miles when they approached the hill in Shepton Montague, Somerset, at around 10am on March 12. He said: ‘As we went over the brow of the hill I saw some potholes. I was slightly ahead of Margaret and to her right. ‘I pointed with my left hand and shouted “potholes”. Within two seconds I heard a bang and I am sure she hit a pothole. ‘I then heard a dull thud as if she had fallen off her bike. I saw Margaret lying in the road still astride her bike. I went back to her and saw she was unconscious.’ An inquest into Mrs Nicholl's death heard that along with husband Richard, the couple cycled up to 4,000 miles each year. Scene: The pothole which Mrs Nicholl hit is marked with an orange box. A drinks can placed inside indicates that the pothole was quite large. PC David Horsley, of Avon and Somerset police, went to the scene shortly after the accident and measured the gradient of the hill to be nine per cent or one in 11. He found five large potholes, with the largest measuring 39 inches (100cm) long, 19 inches (49cm) wide and three inches (8cm) deep. The final pothole - measuring 26 inches (67cm) long, nearly 12 inches wide (30cm) wide and 2.5 inches (6cm) deep - had tyre tracks in mud on it which matched those of Margaret’s bike. Phillip Kingdom, highways inspection manager for Somerset, said he was not surprised that the road was in such a bad state of repair. Mrs Nicholl was rushed to the Royal United Hospital in Bath following the pothole accident, but sadly did not survive. ‘We went through one of the most severe winters I have known. We were experiencing potholes all over the county. ‘We had 25,000 potholes last year in the county, which was a record. There was no extra money available at the time.’ Verdict: Accidental death.

Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Would the air pressure inside lungs increase or decrease in state A? Keith is a physician in a local hospital. He is treating a patient with respiratory problem. He looked at two different states of the patient's diaphragm, state A and state B. In state A the the diaphragm contracted, but in state B the diaphragm relaxed. He now needs to figure out other phenomena related to this. Hint: Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon. A:","completion":"The air pressure inside the lungs would decrease in state A. This is because, in state A, the diaphragm contracts, leading to an expansion of the ribcage and an increase in chest volume. Consequently, the air pressure inside the lungs reduces, causing air to rush into the lungs as the patient inhales."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who wanted to complete the memorial offering to select 35 names from Watt's list of names? from the following article ? Although Watts's plans for the memorial had envisaged names inscribed on the wall, in the event the memorial was designed to hold panels of hand-painted and glazed ceramic tiles. Watts was an acquaintance of William De Morgan, at that time one of the world's leading tile designers, and consequently found them easier and cheaper to obtain than engraved stone. The four initial memorial tablets, installed for the unveiling, each consisted of two large custom-made tiles, with each tablet costing £3 5s (about £360 as of 2019) to produce. Only four tablets were installed by the time of the unveiling ceremony, and Watts already had concerns about the potential costs of installing the 120 tablets envisaged in the memorial's design.Costs were allayed by using standard 6-inch (15 cm) tiles for the next set of tablets, reducing the costs to a more manageable £2 per tablet. In 1902, nine further tablets were installed, intermittently spaced along the central of the five rows, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had lobbied. The subjects of the 13 initial tiles had been personally selected by Watts, who had for many years maintained a list of newspaper reports of heroic actions potentially worthy of recognition. However, by this time he was in his eighties and in increasingly poor health, and in January 1904 the vicar and churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate formed the Humble Heroes Memorial Committee to oversee the completion of the project, agreeing to defer to Watts regarding additions to the memorial. Watts strenuously objected to the name, as \\"not being applicable to anything as splendid as heroic self-sacrifice\\", and the committee was renamed the \\"Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee\\".On 1 July 1904 George Frederic Watts died at New Little Holland House, aged 87. He was hailed \\"The last great Victorian\\", and a memorial service was held in St Paul's Cathedral, 300 yards (270 m) south of Postman's Park, on 7 July 1904.On 11 July 1904 Mary Watts wrote to the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial...

Both sentences' main subjects are 'MERS respiratory illness' being found in North America as well as being acknowledged by the authorities. Step 3: Look for overlapping attributes. Both sentences describe that MERS is a respiratory illness and that this is the first occurrence being reported in North America. Step 4: Identify the differences. The only significant difference between the sentences is the geographic specificity - Sentence 1 specifically states 'U.S.', while Sentence 2 mentions 'North America'. However, since the U.S. is located in North America, we can agree that by mentioning North America it inherently includes the U.S. Also, Sentence 2 specifically mentions that MERS is a 'SARS-like respiratory illness', a detail that Sentence 1 lacks. But this detail adds more context than changing the overall meaning. To summarize, both sentences discuss the same major topic, and there is a high level of overlap in their meanings, with minor differences in the details used to describe the subject. Given the scale provided, I would rate these sentences as 4 out of 5 in terms of meaning overlap.

Tajikistan The earliest recorded history of the region dates back to about 500 BCE when much, if not all, of modern Tajikistan was part of the Achaemenid Empire. Some authors have also suggested that in the 7th and 6th century BCE parts of modern Tajikistan, including territories in the Zeravshan valley, formed part of Kambojas before it became part of the Achaemenid Empire. After the region's conquest by Alexander the Great it became part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, a successor state of Alexander's empire. Northern Tajikistan (the cities of Khujand and Panjakent) was part of Sogdia, a collection of city-states which was overrun by Scythians and Yuezhi nomadic tribes around 150 BCE. The Silk Road passed through the region and following the expedition of Chinese explorer Zhang Qian during the reign of Wudi (141–87 BCE) commercial relations between Han China and Sogdiana flourished. Sogdians played a major role in facilitating trade and also worked in other capacities, as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers.

Mark Bailey didn't dream of becoming a judge. Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed. Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work. Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission. The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice. The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana. \\"This award came as a real surprise to me. It is truly an honor. Just being the first chair of the commission which began the implementation of the pro bono process was somewhat humbling. Question: \\"When did L. Mark Bailey's life changed allowing him to become a judge?\\" Answer: \\"After 1975\\" Is this answer correct? [+] no [+] yes...I think the answer is","completion":"no. The user's question asks about the turning point in L. Mark Bailey's life that allowed him to become a judge. While it's true his journey started after he graduated from high school in 1975, the specific point when his life took a turn towards a career in law and eventually becoming a judge can be traced to when he obtained his bachelor's degree in 1978 from the University of Indianapolis and later a jurisprudence doctorate in 1982 from the Indiana University-Indianapolis. According to the information provided, the crucial change seems to have started with his higher education in law and subsequent entry into private practice after 1982. So, simply stating \\"After 1975\\" as an answer doesn't fully address when his life changed direction towards the judiciary. It skips over the details of his law education which are critical in context of his journey to becoming a judge."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: In what year did the titular counselor abandon his civil servant career? Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky... A:","completion":"1861"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A perfect example is when the filmmaker claims \\"Saul\\" or Paul of Tarus (the writer of The Book of Hebrews He asserts) has no idea Jesus is or was a human being, this assertion is either purposely false as he accuses others of presenting, or he is ignorant of what \\"The Bible\\" says. first we can examine his misleading claim about Hebrews 8.4; which he shows a quote \\"If Jesus was on earth, he would not be a priest\\", hence right here He sets up the ignorant and unlearned viewer to accept his false premise.. why? He does what most so called Bible believing people he accuses of doing, the same.. That is TAKING things out of context. verse one of Hebrews 8 is; 1..\\"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens\\" The context above is CLEARLY speaking of a Jesus who was on earth and ASCENDED into heaven after his alleged resurrection. It has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his out of context scripture. Here he offers a foundation, that \\"Paul was not aware of a HUMAN Jesus, but only one in \\"heaven\\" follow? lets see if the filmmaker is being honest; Hebrews 7; 14. \\"For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.\\" heh, didn't the filmmaker just quote from the writer of Hebrews trying to show the writer of that book has no knowledge of a \\"Human Jesus\\"? it's likely anyways Paul didn't write Hebrews, but I will not go into that here, but The film maker asserts Paul did, and that is the premise of the point given here. It is not like this film maker does not make decent points in certain areas, he does, but he is engaging in the same blind bias of the religion he is bashing on.

Labor Day weekend, which includes the holiday, typically marks the unofficial end of the summer season in the United States. Many businesses and schools start their operations post the long weekend, signaling the onset of fall. Families often use this long weekend as an opportunity to have one last summer outing, hosting picnics or barbecues, or travelling to vacation spots. All non-essential federal offices are closed on Labor Day, as it is recognized as a federal holiday. Essential services like hospitals and airports continue to run, but government agencies like the postal service and federal agencies are usually closed. Public transit may run on a reduced schedule. You can observe numerous events and parades on Labor Day, dedicated to the labor movement.

WWE made the announcement during its weekly “Raw” program on Monday night. Savage, who died in 2011 when he was involved in a fatal car accident, has always been a fan favorite to get inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, but a rumored rift between Savage and WWE chief executive Vince McMahon, which was carried on after Savage’s death by his younger brother Lanny Poffo, has kept him out until now. Tensions have eased, however, according to Poffo, who recalls to The Tampa Tribune how WWE recently approached him to make a documentary about his older brother, born Randy Poffo. The documentary also includes mentions of the Poffo brothers’ dad Angelo’s pro wrestling career, as well as Lanny’s. Lanny used to wrestle under the name “The Genius.” “When they came to my house to interview me for the documentary they arrived with flowers and good will. They made amends,” Poffo said. WWE aired the documentary on its eponymous digital subscription network after “Raw” on Monday. WWE also announced Savage’s longtime friend and rival Hulk Hogan would induct the Macho Man into the Hall of Fame at this year’s annual ceremony set to take place on March 28 in Santa Clara, California. WWE legends and current wrestlers reacted with overwhelming joy on social media after the announcement was made. Excited that #RandySavage is going in HOF!

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Very hard to listen to Product review: In general, I'm a big fan of insect noises (cicadas, crickets, etc.), and I've discovered that it's really hard to find good field recordings. So I was pretty excited about this CD, even though I'd never heard any of it; I was sure I'd love it. However... it doesn't sound at all like I expected. There is no soothing drone, no happy chirp, no peaceful hum. These insects make some impressive and intense sounds, but it's not something I enjoy hearing. At best, it sounds sort of like an AM radio that's not tuned to anything, but more often it just sounds like high, piercing shrieks of feedback. Genuinely painful, even when listened to at a reasonably quiet volume. Answer:","completion":"The mentioned review would most likely decrease the chances of buying the product for several reasons. To provide a detailed analysis, let's break down the review into its different components: 1. Expectations vs. Reality: The reviewer clearly had certain expectations based on their love for insect noises and the difficulty of finding good field recordings. They expected the CD to contain soothing, happy, and peaceful insect sounds. However, their expectations were not met, since the CD did not deliver on these qualities. This mismatch between expectations and reality is a critical factor that plays against purchasing the product. 2. Unpleasant and painful experience: The reviewer explicitly mentions that instead of the desired insect sounds, the CD has rather distressing noises, like an AM radio not tuned to anything, or high shrieks of feedback. The sounds are described as \\"genuinely painful,\\" even at reasonable volume levels. This revelation about the unpleasant nature of the product will certainly deter potential buyers who seek relaxation and tranquility from listening to insect sounds. 3. Perception of product quality: A key aspect of any review is how it reflects the overall quality of the product. This particular review highlights that the product does not meet the customer's expectations and is, in fact, difficult to listen to. This assessment presents a negative image of the product, thus likely reducing potential customers' interest in purchasing it. 4. The emotional connection to the product: The reviewer initially stated that they were excited about the product and were sure they would love it. However, the product failed to deliver on their expectations, leading to disappointment. This emotional connection's conversion from excitement and anticipation to disappointment sends a strong message to potential buyers that the product may not live up to their expectations. In conclusion, the mentioned review would decrease the chances of buying the product due to the disparity between expectations and reality, the unpleasant and painful experience it offers, the reviewer's negative perception of product quality, and the emotional connection's letdown. As a result, potential customers who read this review might decide to look for alternative products with more positive reviews that meet their expectations and provide a more enjoyable listening experience."},{"prompt":"Options: [1]. happy on Taylor's behalf; [2]. empathetic to Taylor's successes; [3]. sad on Taylor's behalf; Q: Cameron turned Taylor's face towards him because Taylor was looking down and sobbing.

In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region. - A purée (or mash) is cooked food, usually vegetables or legumes, that has been ground, pressed, blended or sieved to the consistency of a soft creamy paste or thick liquid. Purées of specific foods are often known by specific names, e.g., applesauce or hummus. The term is of French origin, where it meant in Old French (13th century) \\"purified\\" or \\"refined\\". - Skordalia or skordhalia / skorthalia ( ( skorðaa ) ; in Greek also called ' aliada / aliatha ) is a thick puree ( or sauce , dip , spread , etc. ) in Greek cuisine made by combining crushed garlic with a bulky base -- which may be a purée of potatoes , walnuts , almonds , or liquid - soaked stale bread -- and then beating in olive oil to make a smooth emulsion . Vinegar is often added . - Mediterranean cuisine is the food from the lands around the Mediterranean Sea and its preparation. This geographical area broadly follows the distribution of the olive tree, which provides one of the most distinctive features of the region's cooking, olive oil. - The Balkan Peninsula, or the Balkans, is a peninsula and a cultural area in Eastern and Southeastern Europe with various and disputed borders. The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch from the Serbia-Bulgaria border to the Black Sea. - Olive oil is a fat obtained from the olive (the fruit of \\"Olea europaea\\"; family Oleaceae), a traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean Basin. The oil is produced by pressing whole olives. It is commonly used in cooking, whether for frying or as a salad dressing. It is also used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and soaps, and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps, and finds uses in some religions. It is associated with the Mediterranean diet popularized since the 1950s in North America for its possible health benefits. The olive is one of the three core food plants in Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat and the grape. - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa. - The olive, known by the botanical name Olea europaea, meaning \\"European olive\\", is a species of small tree in the family Oleaceae, found in the Mediterranean Basin from Portugal to the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and southern Asia as far east as China, as well as the Canary Islands, Mauritius and Réunion. The species is cultivated in many places and considered naturalized in all the countries of the Mediterranean coast, as well as in Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Java, Norfolk Island, California and Bermuda. - The Mediterranean diet is a modern nutritional recommendation originally inspired by the dietary patterns of Greece, Southern Italy, and Spain in the 1940s and 1950s. The principal aspects of this diet include proportionally high consumption of olive oil, legumes, unrefined cereals, fruits, and vegetables, moderate to high consumption of fish, moderate consumption of dairy products (mostly as cheese and yogurt), moderate wine consumption, and low consumption of non-fish meat products.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What area in the area that is used for hiking, hunting, and fishing was reopened for fishing in 1959? According to the DCNR, Quehanna Wild Area is for the public \\"to see, use and enjoy for such activities as hiking, hunting, and fishing\\". The main hiking trail on the Quehanna plateau is the Quehanna Trail, a 75-mile (121 km) loop trail that passes through the wild area and Moshannon and Elk State Forests. The main trailhead for most hikers is at Parker Dam State Park to the west of the wild area. From there the trail, which is blazed in orange, heads east to the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, skirts Piper and the Boot Camp there, then turns north, crosses Wykoff Run and turns west again. After passing through Marion Brooks Natural Area, the trail leaves the wild area and completes the loop back at Parker Dam. The Quehanna Trail is considered a strenuous hike not just because of its length, but for its 9,700 feet (2,957 m) of changes in elevation. Two blue-blazed connector trails add 30 miles (48 km) to the system, and there are many side trails and small trails off the Quehanna Highway. Most trails are open to cross-country skiing in the winter. According to the DCNR, the Quehanna Trail \\"passes through some of the most wild and beautiful country Pennsylvania has to offer\\".Susan Stranahan's Susquehanna: River of Dreams reports that before Curtiss-Wright took over the area in 1955, Quehanna was considered \\"some of the best hunting land in the state\\". No hunting or fishing were initially allowed on the leased land, but by July 1959 fishing on Mosquito Creek was allowed again, as was limited hunting to help control the deer. In October 1963 hunting resumed throughout the wild area, four years before the state purchased the land back from Curtiss-Wright. As of 2010, the Pennsylvania Game Commission allowed hunting of the following species found in Quehanna Wild Area: American crow, beaver, black bear, black squirrel, bobcat, bobwhite quail, cottontail rabbit, coyote, elk, house sparrow, raccoon, red fox, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed grouse, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and woodcock.

It has been declared one of the state songs of Louisiana because of its association with Davis, a country music singer and governor of the state in the years 1944–1948 and 1960–1964. Can we draw the following conclusion? You Are My Sunshine is the most popular song of 1939.","completion":"While the song \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" is undoubtedly a classic and has enjoyed immense popularity over the decades, it cannot be definitively concluded that it was the most popular song of 1939. To make such a determination, several factors would need to be considered, such as record sales, chart performance, radio play, and cultural impact during that specific year. \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" was indeed recorded by Jimmie Davis and Charles Mitchell in 1939 and has since been covered by numerous artists across various genres. However, it would not be accurate to state that it was the most popular song of that year without examining the competition. In 1939, the music scene featured several other influential and popular songs and artists. Some notable songs from the same year include \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" performed by Judy Garland from the iconic film \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"; \\"God Bless America,\\" re-popularized by Kate Smith; \\"Moonlight Serenade\\" by Glenn Miller and his orchestra; and \\"Strange Fruit,\\" a groundbreaking socially-conscious song sung by Billie Holiday. Considering these other significant songs from 1939, it's crucial to evaluate their relative popularity and impact during that time. For instance, \\"Over the Rainbow\\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1940 and has since been regarded as one of the most beloved songs in film history. Similarly, \\"Strange Fruit\\" became a symbol of protest against racial violence, playing an essential role in the Civil Rights Movement. Such examples highlight the fact that while \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" remains a popular and cherished song, it is not possible to definitively declare it as the most popular song in 1939 without a comprehensive analysis of various factors such as record sales, radio airplay, and cultural impact during that specific year. In conclusion, while \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" is a classic and significant song, it would be an oversimplification to label it as the most popular song of 1939 without considering the variety of music released during that year and how other songs and artists influenced the listening audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: “SPF” refers to a sunscreen’s “sun protective factor,” or how effectively it blocks UVB rays. The SPF number reflects the amount of time it takes to sunburn wearing the sunscreen vs. not wearing the sunscreen. For example, an SPF of 30 means that you can spend 30 times as long in the sun before burning compared to not wearing any sunscreen at all. So, if you would usually begin to burn after 5 minutes in the sun, an SPF of 30 would theoretically allow you to spend time outside for 150 minutes (30 x 5) before you burn. However, your unique skin, your activities, and the sun’s intensity all cause variation in how effective sunscreen is, so you may need to use more than other people. The SPF number can be tricky, because its protection doesn’t increase proportionally. Thus, SPF 60 is not twice as good as SPF 30. SPF 15 blocks about 94% of UVB rays, SPF 30 blocks about 97%, and SPF 45 blocks about 98%. No sunscreen blocks 100% of UVB rays. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends an SPF of 30 or higher. The difference between extremely high SPFs is often negligible and not worth the extra money. SPF refers only to the ability to block UVB rays, which cause sunburn. However, the sun also emits UVA rays. UVA rays cause skin damage, such as signs of aging, wrinkles and dark or light spots. Both increase your risk of skin cancer. A broad-spectrum sunscreen provides protection from both UVA and UVB rays. Some sunscreens may not say “broad-spectrum” on the packaging. However, they should always state whether they protect against UVB and UVA rays. Most broad-spectrum sunscreens contain “inorganic” components such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, as well as “organic” sunscreen components such as avobenzone, Cinoxate, oxybenzone, or octyl methoxycinnamate. Because your body expels water through sweat, you should look for a water-resistant sunscreen. This is especially important if you are going to be very active, such as running or hiking, or if you’ll be in the water. No sunscreen is “waterproof” or “sweat proof.” In the US, sunscreens cannot market themselves as “waterproof.” Even with water-resistant sunscreen, reapply every 40-80 minutes or as directed on the label. Some people prefer spray sunscreens, while others prefer thick creams or gels. Whatever you decide, make sure you apply a thick, even coating. The application is as important as the SPF and other factors: if you don’t apply it properly, the sunscreen won’t do its job. Sprays may be best for hairy areas, while creams are usually best for dry skin. Alcohol or gel sunscreens are good for oily skin. You can also purchase wax sunscreen sticks, which are good for applying near the eyes. This is often a good choice for children, as it avoids getting the sunscreen in the eyes. They also have the benefit of not spilling (such as in a purse) and can be applied without getting lotion on your hands. Water resistant \\"sports type\\" sunscreens are often sticky, so they are not good choices for applying under makeup. For acne-prone individual, take care in selecting your sunscreen. Look for those that are designed specifically for your face and will not clog pores. These often have higher SPF (15 or higher), and are less likely to clog pores or increase acne breakouts. Many acne-prone individuals find that zinc oxide-based sunscreens tend to work best. Look for \\"non-comedogenic\\", \\"will not clog pores\\", \\"for sensitive skin\\", or \\"for acne-prone skin\\" on the labels. If you see any allergic reaction or skin problem, buy a different sunscreen. Repeat the process until you find the right sunscreen, or talk to your doctor about recommended brands if you have sensitive skin or allergies. Itching, redness, burning, or blisters are all signs of an allergic reaction. Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are less likely to cause allergic skin reactions.","completion":"Sun protective factor (SPF) denotes a sunscreen's ability to block harmful UVB rays emanating from the sun. The SPF number measures the length of time an individual can stay in the sun without getting sunburned while wearing sunscreen, as opposed to not wearing any. For instance, an SPF 30 sunscreen allows a person to remain in the sun 30 times longer without burning. But various factors, such as skin type, activities, and sun intensity, can affect its efficacy. Protection levels do not increase proportionally with the SPF number, which means higher SPFs offer only marginal extra benefits. The American Academy of Dermatology suggests using SPF 30 or higher. SPF only signifies protection against UVB rays, while UVA rays are responsible for skin aging, wrinkles, and spots. Both UVA and UVB rays can lead to skin cancer. A broad-spectrum sunscreen provides defense against both types of rays. Broad-spectrum sunscreens usually contain both inorganic components, like titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, and organic components like avobenzone and oxybenzone. Water-resistant sunscreens are ideal for activities involving sweat and water exposure, but these sunscreens aren't waterproof and need to be reapplied frequently. Different sunscreen forms, such as sprays, creams, gels, and wax sticks, cater to various preferences, skin types, and usage scenarios. Consider the specific requirements for areas like hairy or dry skin, or when applying near the eyes or under makeup. For people with acne-prone skin, zinc oxide-based, non-comedogenic sunscreens are recommended. In case of allergic reactions or skin irritation, try another sunscreen or consult a physician for a suitable product. Ingredients like titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are less likely to cause allergic reactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: John Bruce \\"Jack\\" Thompson (born July 25, 1951) is an American activist and disbarred attorney, based in Coral Gables, Florida. Thompson is known for his role as an anti-video-game activist, particularly against violence and sex in video games. During his time as an attorney, Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture. This included rap music, broadcasts by shock jock Howard Stern, the content of computer and video games and their alleged effects on children. Thompson has heavily criticized a number of video games and campaigned against their producers and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as \\"murder simulators\\" to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games and a number of school massacres. According to Thompson, \\"In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers.\\" Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, \\"If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain.\\" Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as \\"Pearl Harbor 2\\". According to Thompson, \\"Many parents think that stores won't sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked.\\" Thompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by freedom of expression, saying, \\"Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They're not even speech. They're dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it,\\" as well as simply calling video games \\"mental masturbation\\". In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, saying that it was looking \\"for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end\\". Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller \\"gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill. This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner's laboratory.\\" Although his efforts dealing with video games have generally focused on juveniles, Thompson got involved in a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the \\"functional equivalent of a 15-year-old,\\" and \\"the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense\\". Was Thompson able to show the games influenced the defendant?","completion":"No, Thompson was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who asks the family servant to kill the high-born drunken cad? ? Sire Alain de Maletroit, plots revenge on his younger brother Edmond for stealing Alain's childhood sweetheart, who died giving birth to Edmond's daughter Blanche. Alain secretly imprisons Edmond in his dungeon for 20 years and convinces Blanche that her father is dead. Alain intends to further debase Blanche as revenge against Edmond. Alain tricks a high-born drunken cad, Denis de Beaulieu, in to believeing he has murdered a man. Denis escapes a mob by entering the Maletroit chateau by an exterior door which has no latch on the inside. Alain makes Denis a captive intending to force the delicate Blanche into marriage with him. Alain goes to the dungeon to torture Edmond with the news Blanche will be married to Denis, an unworthy rogue. After Alain leaves, Edmond asks the family servant Voltan to kill Denis before the wedding. However, Denis shows unanticipated redemptive qualities and he and Blanche fall in love. When Voltan comes to kill Denis, Blanche pleads with Voltan to spare his life and help him escape. Their attempts to escape are foiled by Alain, who then seals Edmond, Blanche and Denis in a stone cell and starts a waterwheel that presses the cell walls inward to crush them to death. Voltan fights Alain and gets the key to the dungeon and pushes Alain into the waterwheel, temporarily stopping the crushing walls. Wounded by the guards, Voltan struggles to the dungeon and, with his dying breath, gets the key to Denis just as the walls start moving in again. Denis, Blanche and her father escape the cell.

In another way, failure may be a way towards success. The \\"spider-story\\" is often told. Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a cave from the English. He watched a spider making a web . The spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock. He tried six times. On the seventh time he made it and went on to make his web. Bruce is said to have been encouraged by this and to have gone on to defeat the English. Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one. Once he was asked why he kept on trying to make a new type of battery when he had failed so often, he replied, \\"Failure? I have no failure. Now I know 50,000 ways it won't work.\\" So what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were conditions right? Were you in top form yourself? What can you change so things will go right next time? Second, is the goal you're trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be.

You also may be able to get Frontline at some drug stores, like Walgreens. It's a good idea to buy Frontline from a vet, however, as a veterinarian can a make sure you get the right product. Frontline makes flea and tick treatments for dogs as well as cats. Make sure you use the medication designed for your pet. The dosages are sold according to the weight of the pet. Check the weight recommendations on the package and get a dosage appropriate for your pet's weight. Frontline comes with several small plastic applicators. They look something like little bottles. Each applicator contains a single dose of Frontline. There are perforated lines between each applicator. You can separate the applicators by tearing or cutting along the perforated line. Be careful when separating the applicators. You want to make sure you do not tear an applicator and spill a dosage of Frontline. Each applicator has a small tip that you can easily snap off. You must snap off the tip prior to applying Frontline to your dog or cat. Make sure to do this away from your face to avoid getting the chemicals in your eyes. If the tip does not come off easily, you can use scissors to cut it off. You should apply Frontline on your pet's back, directly between your pet's shoulders. Frontline is safe to use on a pet's skin, but should not be ingested by the pet. Your pet will be unable to reach this area, preventing them from licking Frontline off. Part your pet's fur so you can see its skin. This is very important. To work effectively, Frontline must be absorbed into your pet's skin.

It was fun for the first hour, you spend most of your time in tedious battles. It has a crumby storyline, and isnt nearly as good as Zelda 64. This game shouldnt be considered an RPG, because its the worst one I've played. Answer:","completion":"Based on the customer's review, it can be concluded that they were dissatisfied with the product they purchased. The use of negative language and expressions throughout their review indicates their disappointment and dissatisfaction. Let's look at the review in detail to understand why this conclusion is drawn. The customer starts with the title \\"Its all hype,\\" which suggests that the product did not live up to the expectations set by its advertising or word-of-mouth chatter. This immediately reveals their negative perception. The customer then continues by saying, \\"Its not nearly as good as I thought it would be,\\" another clear signal of dissatisfaction as the product failed to meet their personal expectations. The following statement, \\"It is an easy game with tons of tedious repetition,\\" indicates that the customer found the game too easy and repetitive, which are generally seen as negative qualities in games, especially in the scope of replayability and continuous engagement. The customer also states that the game was \\"fun for the first hour,\\" implying that any enjoyment derived from the product was short-lived and that it quickly became tedious and not fun, further solidifying the notion that they were dissatisfied. Further within the review, the customer comments that the product has \\"a crumby storyline,\\" which is another negative assessment. They compare the game unfavorably to \\"Zelda 64,\\" demonstrating that they consider other games superior and more satisfying. Finally, the strongest expression of dissatisfaction comes when the customer states, \\"This game shouldn't be considered an RPG, because it's the worst one I've played.\\" This claim not only suggests dissatisfaction but potentially frustration and severe disappointment. Overall, the negative comments and unfavorable comparisons provided in the customer's review make it evident that their experience with the product led to dissatisfaction. They lament the game's lack of complexity, the story's quality, and the gameplay's overall design. For these reasons, the customer's review can be characterized as one of clear dissatisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Ancient Rome was an Italic civilization that began on the Italian Peninsula as early as the 8th century BC. Located along the Mediterranean Sea and centered on the city of Rome, it expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population) and covering 5.0 million square kilometers at its height in AD 117. - Oliver Grau ( born 24 October 1965 ) is a German art historian and media theoretician with a focus on image science , modernity and media art as well as culture of the 19th century and Italian art of the Renaissance . - Carolingian art comes from the Frankish Empire in the period of roughly 120 years from about 780 to 900 during the reign of Charlemagne and his immediate heirs popularly known as the Carolingian Renaissance. The art was produced by and for the court circle and a group of important monasteries under Imperial patronage; survivals from outside this charmed circle show a considerable drop in quality of workmanship and sophistication of design. The art was produced in several centres in what are now France, Germany, Austria, northern Italy and the Low Countries, and received considerable influence, via continental mission centres, from the Insular art of the British Isles, as well as a number of Byzantine artists who appear to have been resident in Carolingian centres. - Paestum was a major ancient Greek city on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Magna Graecia (southern Italy). The ruins of Paestum are famous for their three ancient Greek temples in the Doric order, dating from about 600 to 450 BC, which are in a very good state of preservation. The city walls and amphitheatre are largely intact, and the bottom of the walls of many other structures remain, as well as paved roads. The site is open to the public, and there is a modern national museum within it, which also contains the finds from the associated Greek site of Foce del Sele. - Since prehistoric times, Greeks, Etruscans and Celts have inhabited the south, centre and north of the Italian peninsula respectively. The very numerous Rock Drawings in Valcamonica go back to 8,000 BC, and there are rich remains of Etruscan art from thousands of tombs, as well as rich remains from the Greek colonies at Paestum, Agrigento and elsewhere. Ancient Rome finally emerged as the dominant Italian and European power. The Roman remains in Italy are of extraordinary richness, from the grand Imperial monuments of Rome itself to the survival of exceptionally preserved ordinary buildings in Pompeii and neighbouring sites. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, in the Middle Ages Italy, especially the north, remained an important centre, not only of the Carolingian art and Ottonian art of the Holy Roman Emperors, but for the Byzantine art of Ravenna and other sites. - Modernity is a term of art used in the humanities and social sciences to designate both a historical period (the modern era), as well as the ensemble of particular socio-cultural norms, attitudes and practices that arose in post-medieval Europe and have developed since, in various ways and at various times, around the world. While it includes a wide range of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena (from fashion to modern warfare), it can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of the conditions they produce, and their ongoing impact on human culture, institutions, and politics . - Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science. - The Greeks or Hellenes are an ethnic group native to Greece, Cyprus, southern Albania, Turkey, Sicily, Egypt and, to a lesser extent, other countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. They also form a significant diaspora, with Greek communities established around the world. - The Holy Roman Emperor (historically \\"\\" \\"Emperor of the Romans\\") was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From an autocracy in Carolingian times the title evolved into an elected monarchy chosen by the Prince-electors. Until the Reformation the Emperor elect (\\"imperator electus\\") was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Pompeii was an ancient Roman town-city near modern Naples, in the Campania region of Italy, in the territory of the comune of Pompei. Pompeii, along with Herculaneum and many villas in the surrounding area, was mostly destroyed and buried under of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The stone carvings of Val Camonica (Camonica Valley) are located in the Province of Brescia, Italy, and constitute the largest collections of prehistoric petroglyphs in the world. The collection was recognized by Unesco in 1979 and was Italy's first recognized World Heritage Site. Unesco has formally recognized more than 140,000 figures and symbols, but new discoveries have increased the number of catalogued incisions to between 200,000 and 300,000. The petroglyphs are spread on all surfaces of the valley, but concentrated in the areas of Darfo Boario Terme, Capo di Ponte, Nadro, Cimbergo and Paspardo. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - Ravenna (also locally ) is the capital city of the Province of Ravenna, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy. It was the capital city of the Western Roman Empire from 402 until that empire collapsed in 476. It then served as the capital of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths until it was re-conquered in 540 by the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Afterwards, the city formed the centre of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna until the invasion of the Lombards in 751, after which it became the seat of the Kingdom of the Lombards. - Etruscan art was produced by the Etruscan civilization in central Italy between the 9th and 2nd centuries BC. From around 600 BC it was heavily influenced by Greek art, which was imported by the Etruscans, but always retained distinct characteristics. Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (especially life-size on sarcophagi or temples), wall-painting and metalworking especially in bronze. Jewellery and engraved gems of high quality were produced. - Ottonian art is a style in pre-romanesque German art, covering also some works from the Low Countries, northern Italy and eastern France. It was named by the art historian Hubert Janitschek after the Ottonian dynasty which ruled Germany and northern Italy between 919 and 1024 under the kings Henry I, Otto I, Otto II, Otto III and Henry II. With Ottonian architecture, it is a key component of the Ottonian Renaissance (circa 9511024). However, the style neither began nor ended to neatly coincide with the rule of the dynasty. It emerged some decades into their rule and persisted past the Ottonian emperors into the reigns of the early Salian dynasty, which lacks an artistic \\"style label\\" of its own. In the traditional scheme of art history, Ottonian art follows Carolingian art and precedes Romanesque art, though the transitions at both ends of the period are gradual rather than sudden. Like the former and unlike the latter, it was very largely a style restricted to a few of the small cities of the period, and important monasteries, as well as the court circles of the emperor and his leading vassals. - The Celts (occasionally , see pronunciation of \\"Celtic\\") were people in Iron Age and Medieval Europe who spoke Celtic languages and had cultural similarities, although the relationship between ethnic, linguistic and cultural factors in the Celtic world remains uncertain and controversial. The exact geographic spread of the ancient Celts is also disputed; in particular, the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts has become a subject of controversy.

Plants also detect the daily cycle of light and darkness. Do you know how plants respond to these changes? Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off. This dormancy period helps trees. It allows them to survive the cold and dry winter. Plants only want to grow when conditions are right.

Article: A new study suggests that listening to music in the office improves the speed and accuracy of tasks such as data entry, proof reading and problem solving. In an office-based experiment, 88 per cent of participants were found to produce their most accurate work when listening to music. The study also found that 81 per cent completed their fastest work when music was played. And it matters what type of music you listen to. For instance, if you're doing your tax returns, then classical music is the most effective as it improves maths skills. Listening to Jessie Jor Justin Bieber could also improve your speed, with 58 per cent of participants completing data entry tasks faster while listening to pop songs. During proof-reading, dance music, such as David Guetta, had the biggest positive impact with participants increasing their speed by 20 per cent compared to tests undertaken with no music at all. Dance music also had a positive effect on spell-checking with a 75 per cent pass rate compared to 68 per cent when no music was played at all. The research, undertaken by Brighton-based Mind lab International, suggests that silent offices may be the least productive. 'The Music Works experiment revealed a positive _ between music and productivity - overall it showed that when listening to music, nine out of 10 people performed better,' said Dr David Lewis, chairman of Mind lab International.

Answer the question...where in lake superior is the edmund fitzgerald??","completion":"The SS Edmund Fitzgerald, an American Great Lakes freighter, lies at the bottom of the eastern part of Lake Superior, specifically in Canadian waters, approximately 17 miles (27 kilometers) north-northwest of Whitefish Point, Michigan, USA. The Fitzgerald sank on November 10, 1975, during a severe storm when it suddenly disappeared from radar screens. Bound for a steel mill in Detroit, Michigan, the Fitzgerald was carrying 26,116 long tons of iron ore pellets when it encountered hurricane-force winds and waves of up to 35 feet (11 meters). Captain Ernest McSorley, a seasoned seaman with years of experience on the Great Lakes, had reported to a nearby ship, the SS Arthur M. Anderson, that the Fitzgerald was \\"taking on water\\" and had lost several navigation aids. At around 7:10 PM, the Anderson lost contact with the Fitzgerald, which had ultimately succumbed to the fury of the storm. The exact location of the wreck is at the coordinates 46°59′59″N and 85°06′50″W. In the days following the incident, the United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard launched a search and recovery operation, which led to the discovery of the sunken vessel using a U.S. Navy aircraft equipped with an underwater detection device called a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD). The search led to the first underwater images of the wreck in 1976. Due to its depth at approximately 530 feet (160 meters) below the surface, technical divers and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) have been utilized to explore the remains of the vessel. ROVs have documented the wreck's condition, revealing two large sections of the boat: the bow, which is oriented east to west, and the stern, which is facing southward and upside down. In 1995, the bell of the Edmund Fitzgerald was retrieved from the wreck using an ROV and replaced with a replica that bears the names of the 29 crew members who tragically lost their lives. The original bell is now housed in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum at Whitefish Point, where it serves as a memorial. The SS Edmund Fitzgerald's wreck has been the focus of scientific research, investigations, and speculation regarding the causes of the disaster. Numerous documentaries, books, and even a song by Gordon Lightfoot, \\"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\\" have highlighted the freighter's tragic story, making it a symbol of the inherent dangers of maritime transit on the Great Lakes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What might be the first step of the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The first step in the human reproductive and development process is the formation of the embryo, which occurs when a male sperm cell successfully fertilizes a female egg cell. This union takes place during the process of conception, usually within the female's fallopian tubes. To provide you with a detailed and comprehensive understanding of this first step, let's take a closer look at the events leading up to and the process of conception: 1. Ovulation: A woman's menstrual cycle plays a critical role in the process of conception. Roughly halfway through her cycle, a mature egg cell (ovum) is released from one of the ovaries, an event known as ovulation. This egg then moves into the fallopian tube in anticipation of fertilization. 2. Capacitation and Acrosome Reaction: Sperm cells, which have been deposited in the vagina during ejaculation, must first undergo a process called capacitation in which they become capable of penetrating the egg. This involves modifications to the sperm cells' membrane, rendering it more fluid and more likely to fuse with the egg. As the sperm approaches the egg, an acrosome reaction occurs, in which the enzymes stored in the sperm's head (the acrosome) are released. These enzymes help to digest the outer layers of the egg, facilitating penetration. 3. Fertilization: Fertilization ultimately occurs when a sperm cell successfully penetrates the egg's outer layers and fuses with its membrane, allowing the sperm's genetic material into the egg. The sperm's nucleus then merges with the egg's nucleus, resulting in a zygote, which contains a full set of chromosomes (46 in total) and is the single cell from which an entire individual will develop. 4. Embryo formation: The zygote begins to divide through the process of mitosis, rapidly multiplying its number of cells. As this cellular mass continues to grow, it moves down the fallopian tube and eventually implants itself into the uterus. Implantation marks the beginning of what is now known as an embryo. In summary, the first step of the reproductive and development process is the formation of an embryo, which occurs through the processes of ovulation, capacitation and acrosome reaction, fertilization, and mitotic division. This embryonic stage will later be followed by further growth and development, leading to the formation of a fetus, birth, and subsequent growth stages such as infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer a question about the following article about Gene: Essential genes are the set of genes thought to be critical for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients and the absence of environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's genes are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes). What are the set of genes which are thought to be crucial for the survival of an organism?","completion":"The set of genes thought to be crucial for the survival of an organism are called essential genes. Essential genes are integral for the proper functioning, growth, and development of an organism under optimal conditions, which assumes abundant availability of all relevant nutrients and the absence of environmental stress. These genes typically play vital roles in various biological processes such as protein synthesis, DNA replication, cellular metabolism, and cellular structure maintenance, among others. It is important to note that the number of essential genes varies between different organisms. In bacteria, like Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, approximately 250–400 genes (less than 10% of their total genes) are considered essential. Interestingly, around half of these genes are orthologs, or genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the number of essential genes is slightly higher at about 1,000 genes, which represents approximately 20% of their total genes. For higher eukaryotes such as mice and humans, determining the exact number of essential genes is more challenging; however, it is estimated that about 2,000 genes (around 10% of their total genes) are essential for their survival. In conclusion, essential genes are the set of genes considered to be crucial for an organism's survival under optimal conditions. The number and specific functions of these genes may vary between different organisms, but they generally play critical roles in fundamental biological processes, and their disruption could lead to severe consequences or even the death of the organism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There could be several factors influencing whether or not the man will choose to sweep behind the flats, such as: 1. The scope of the man's responsibility: If the man is responsible only for the area in front of the wall, he may not feel obligated to sweep behind the flats. However, if he is responsible for maintaining the entire area, it might be more likely that he would eventually sweep behind the flats. 2. Accessibility to the area behind the flats: It is unclear how accessible the area behind the flats is. If it's a restricted area or difficult to access, the man might not be able to sweep there. 3. The condition of the area behind the flats: If the area behind the flats is already clean or sees minimal foot traffic, the man might choose not to sweep there, as it may not be a priority for him. 4. Time constraints: It is also possible that the man is on a tight schedule and can only attend to the area in front of the wall, making it less likely for him to sweep behind the flats. 5. Personal motivations: The man's personal motivations and priorities could also influence his decision to sweep behind the flats or not. If he takes pride in his work and wants the entire area to be as clean as possible, he may opt to sweep everywhere, including behind the flats. However, if he only aims to fulfill his minimum obligations, he might choose not to do so. In conclusion, based on the information available, it is not possible to tell whether the man will use the broom to sweep behind the flats or not.

Article: The old saying that practice makes perfect seems to make no sense when it comes to schoolwork. Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \\"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. \\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills. Wherever the homework debate goes next, it's worth taking a moment to examine if we're doing the right thing about our children's education. The good news is -- it's never too late to start.

We often find ourselves wondering whether we have enough of each color when the need arises for printing colorful documents. But did you know you can easily test your printer cartridges at home using Microsoft Word? By creating a simple color test page, you can quickly determine if your printer has sufficient ink or toner levels and even maintain your print head if your printer isn't frequently used. In this article, we will guide you through the process step-by-step. Step 1: Open Microsoft Word Open Microsoft Word (or any similar program) on your computer. If you don't have Word, you can also use free alternatives like LibreOffice or Google Docs. Step 2: Create Four Small Rectangles Once you have a new blank document open, click on the \\"Insert\\" tab in the top menu. Select \\"Shapes\\" and then choose the \\"Rectangle\\" shape. Draw four small rectangles on the page. Step 3: Color the Rectangles Now it's time to color each rectangle. Start by clicking on one of the rectangles to select it. In the \\"Shape Format\\" tab, click on \\"Shape Fill\\" and select the appropriate color for each rectangle: - First rectangle: Black - Second rectangle: Blue - Third rectangle: Red - Fourth rectangle: Yellow Step 4: Print the Test Page With all four rectangles colored, it's time to put your printer to the test. Simply click on \\"File\\" in the top menu, then choose \\"Print.\\" Make sure that your printer is selected and print the color test document. Step 5: Assess the Results Examine the printed test page. If all of the colors have come out clearly and accurately, it means that your printer cartridges have enough ink or toner in each color. If any color appears faint or not at all, it may be time to replace the corresponding cartridge. Step 6: Save the Test File Don't forget to save your color test file for future use. Click on \\"File\\" and then \\"Save As.\\" Choose a location such as \\"My Documents\\" and give your file a descriptive name, like \\"Printer Cartridge Test.\\" This way, you can quickly find your test file whenever you need to check your printer cartridges again. Step 7: Run the Test Periodically It's a good idea to run this simple color test occasionally, especially if your printer isn't used very often. Performing the test will help work the print head, preventing clogs and ensuring that your printer is always in tip-top shape. Conclusion: It's easy to assume that your printer's ink or toner levels are sufficient until you're in the middle of an important print job and suddenly run out of a particular color. By creating a simple test file in Microsoft Word, you can save yourself from potential frustration and keep your printer in great condition. Never be left guessing about your printer cartridges again, and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing you're always prepared for your next print job."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rebecca asked Mary to turn off her phone while in the theater, because","completion":"the constant buzz of notifications and glaring light from the screen were not only a distraction to them but also to the other theatergoers around them. Mary, although initially hesitant, agreed to do so out of respect for not only Rebecca but also the shared experience of everyone present. Each member of the audience had paid to enjoy the performance and be wholly immersed in the artistic expression of the actors, the musicians, and the stage designers. The theater, well-known for showcasing incredibly talented artists, had always held a special place in the hearts of the community. It was a place where people gathered to forget their troubles, to share in the joy or pain of the characters depicted, and to embrace their shared love of the arts—an environment where every person’s focus was purely on the connection between art and life. Rebecca understood that when someone had to continuously check their phone or respond to messages or notifications, it created a disconnection from the present moment. She knew that Mary, her best friend for years, had a difficult time fully disconnecting from her phone. However, this experience at the theater meant a great deal to Rebecca, and she wanted to ensure that they could both give the performance the attention it deserved. In the dimmed lights and the hushed anticipation of the theater, being present became especially crucial. They were surrounded by a diverse group of people, each person emanating unique hopes, desires, and expectations. Some were there to escape from their daily routine and be transported to a world of endless possibility. Others sought inspiration or solace from the riveting stories being told on stage. Whatever their reasons for attending, they all undoubtedly deserved a chance to be engaged and captivated by the performance. By turning off her phone, Mary acknowledged the importance of focusing on the world unfolding before her eyes and ears, allowing herself to be wholly engaged and in tune with the actors' emotions, the vibrant music, and the artistry that went into creating such an awe-inspiring experience on stage. With her phone no longer a distraction, Mary felt the vibrations of the music in her heart and noticed the intricate details of the stage design that she may have missed if her phone had been on. Rebecca was grateful for her friend's willingness to shelve a piece of her digital life for the few hours they would spend in the theater. As the curtain drew to a close and the audience roared in applause, the brilliance of what they had witnessed was palpable. The performers had executed every line, every move, every note with precision and passion, and the audience had remained thoroughly engaged throughout. In that moment, it wasn't just about witnessing the phenomenal talent of the artists but also about honoring the shared human experience of hundreds of people being moved emotionally and unified through art. Rebecca and Mary left the theater that evening with an even deeper bond, their spirits soaring and hearts warmed from the enchanting world they had experienced together. This showed them the true value of being present in the moment—switching off their digital lives to connect authentically with each other and the world around them. By doing so, they opened themselves to the beautiful nuances, emotions, and messages that not only transcended the stage but also resonated with their souls. In the end, turning off Mary's phone served as a poignant reminder of just how powerful a theater experience could be when allowed to unfold without interruption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I liked the mood and the basic premise of the book, but the constant shifting in viewpoint between the characters and the jumping back and forth from the present to past events just made me quit reading half way. It just became too irritating and with over a year's reading to do on my bookshelf, I just couldn't justify spending any more time on it.

In Darwin's time there was no agreed-upon model of heredity; in Chapter I Darwin admitted, \\"The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown.\\" He accepted a version of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (which after Darwin's death came to be called Lamarckism), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought \\"there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited\\", and that this also applied in nature. Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of Origin, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection. The observation that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of understanding of the underlying hereditary mechanism. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did Darwin speculate might be how inheritable variations might come about in a species?","completion":"Darwin speculated that inheritable variations might be produced by environmental factors.

The game and its sequel ( Cybersphere Plus ) have recently been released as freeware by the designer . It was designed by Clay Hellman and published by Psycon Software . Cybersphere uses OPL3 FM sound synthesis chip and therefore may require a use of an emulator such as DOSBox for the audio to work . - Proprietary software is computer software for which the software's publisher or another person retains intellectual property rightsusually copyright of the source code, but sometimes patent rights. - Overview. The player controls the \\"Vaus\\", a space vessel that acts as the game's \\"paddle\\" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks. The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same. - Freeware is proprietary software that is available for use at no monetary cost. In other words, freeware may be used without payment but may usually not be modified, re-distributed or reverse-engineered without the author's permission. Two historic examples of freeware include Skype and Adobe Acrobat Reader. - Skype is an application that provides video chat and voice call services. Users may exchange such digital documents as images, text, video and any other, and may transmit both text and video messages. Skype allows the creation of video conference calls. - A ball is a round object (usually spherical but sometimes ovoid) with various uses. It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, marbles and juggling. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles. - A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay, but it is now used to denote any rectangular units laid in mortar. A brick can be composed of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime, or concrete materials. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are \\"fired\\" and \\"non-fired\\" bricks. - A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. The term \\"laser\\" originated as an acronym for \\"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\\". The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light \\"coherently\\". Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography. Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers. Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum, i.e., they can emit a single color of light. Temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light as short as a femtosecond. - In video games, power-ups are objects that instantly benefit or add extra abilities to the game character as a game mechanic. This is in contrast to an item, which may or may not have a benefit and can be used at a time chosen by the player. Although often collected directly through touch, power-ups can sometimes only be gained by collecting several related items, such as the floating letters of the word 'EXTEND' in \\"Bubble Bobble\\". Well known examples of power-ups that have entered popular culture include the power pellets from \\"Pac-Man\\" (regarded as the first power-up) and the Super Mushroom from \\"Super Mario Bros.\\", which ranked first in UGO Networks' \\"Top 11 Video Game Powerups\\".

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Fact 1: Biofuel is used to produce electricity by burning. Fact 2: Biofuels are alcohols, such as ethanol or other chemicals, derived from biomass or living matter. Given the two facts above, what produces electricity by burning? Answer:","completion":"Given the two facts provided, we can deduce that biofuels, specifically alcohols like ethanol or other chemicals derived from biomass or living matter, produce electricity by burning. Biofuels are a renewable energy source made from organic materials, such as plant and animal waste, agricultural residue, and other living matter. The process of producing electricity through burning biofuels generally involves three main steps: 1. Production of biofuel: This step involves converting biomass or living matter into biofuels, such as ethanol or other chemicals. This can be achieved through various methods such as fermentation, transesterification, or thermochemical processes. In the case of ethanol, for example, the raw materials (often sugar, starch, or cellulose from plants) are broken down and fermented by microorganisms, resulting in alcohol, which is then purified and refined for usage. 2. Combustion of biofuel: Once the biofuel has been produced, it needs to be burned to release energy. This involves mixing the biofuel with air (or, in some cases, oxygen) under high pressure and temperature conditions. The combustion process generates heat, along with carbon dioxide and water vapor as byproducts. 3. Electricity generation: The heat generated during the combustion of biofuels is used to produce steam, which then drives one or more turbines connected to generators. As the steam passes through the turbine blades, it causes them to rotate at high speeds. This mechanical energy is then converted into electrical energy by the generator, which produces electricity that can be used to power homes, businesses, and industries. It is worth noting that the efficiency of electricity generation through biofuel combustion depends on various factors, such as the type of biofuel used, the combustion technology, and the overall system design. In general, the use of biofuels for electricity generation can offer benefits such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased energy security, and support for rural economies. However, it is also important to consider potential challenges and trade-offs, such as land-use changes, food-versus-fuel debates, and the overall environmental impact of biofuel production and use."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the subject of the painting that Hans Hieronymus Imhoff gave a lukewarm description for? from the following article ? After the painter's death in 1528, the portraits were held by his brother, and then his brother's widow before they passed into the collection of Willibald Imhoff, a grandson of Dürer's friend Willibald Pirckheimer. Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573–74, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after mention in the 1633–58 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown. Dürer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as \\"among the most severe losses in the Dürer oeuvre\\". In 1977, art historian Lotte Brand Philip proposed that Unknown Woman in a Coif, held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the anonymous Mainz painter Master W. B. Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme and size with the father panel at the Uffizi. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and Dürer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background. Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3 cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and Dürer's 1514 charcoal drawing Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63. Fedja Anzelewsky agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as \\"precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds\\".Anzelewsky speculated that the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to Rudolph II of Austria.

The Residencia de Estudiantes, or student residences, is a modern environment which encourages Spain's brightest young minds. Salvador, who is determined to become a great artist, soon catches the attention of the Resi's social elite poet Federico García Lorca (Javier Beltran) and aspiring filmmaker Luis Buñuel (Matthew McNulty). Together they form the nucleus of the most modern group in Madrid. Their private lives become increasingly complex as Federico ignores the advances of devoted friend and writer Magdalena (Marina Gatell), and Salvador himself feels the pull of García Lorca's magnetism. Luis, becoming increasingly isolated by the duo's closeness, decides to move to Paris to fulfill his own artistic ambitions. Meanwhile, Salvador and Federico leave Madrid to spend the summer at the seaside village of Cadaques, at the home of Dalí's family. Federico finds himself accepted[1] into the Dalí family as he and Salvador grow closer until, one night, their friendship becomes more.[2] Even as they draw closer, their relationship appears doomed. Luis visits them at university and becomes more suspicious and appalled by their apparent closeness. Dalí finds García Lorca's obsession with him more than he is prepared to handle and moves to Paris.

Before you approach an otaku girl, remind yourself that she is an individual person with her own quirks, beliefs, and personality. Some of her characteristics might scream “typical” otaku, but many won't. The same thing can be said about impressing her once you've already met and started to date. There is no single set of steps that can be used on every girl who falls under the “otaku” label—including the steps listed in this article. Use the label as a starting point, but always personalize your approach based on the specific girl. Otaku girls can often be found online in chat rooms, forums, and various social media websites. Moreover, these girls are often comfortable interacting in the digital realm and can appreciate an online meeting just as well as an offline one. Navigate forums related to anime, manga, or other aspects of otaku culture. Join active groups on Facebook or other social media websites about those topics, as well, and participate in the discussions that go on as much as possible. When you find an interesting girl, start following her on her blog or on one or two social media websites. Don't follow all of her accounts at once, though, since doing so may come on too strong and scare her away. Not every otaku girl is glued to her computer monitor, of course. The vast majority have lives in the real world, and if you want a more traditional meeting, your best bet is to track down the otaku girl in her natural habitat. In other words, go someplace related to her interests since she'd be likely to visit there in her free time. For example, try going to a store that has a wide selection of anime or manga. Spend time at an arcade. See a movie that has a large female fandom or, if you're feeling especially daring, try going to an anime convention. Once you find a girl who piques your interest, you need to make a good first impression. You don't necessarily need a flashy, witty pick-up line, though. Striking up an interesting conversation might be more than enough. Discussions about shows, movies, and related media tend to be a good place to start, especially if you see her looking at a similar series in a store.

Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Health workers administering polio vaccinations came under fresh attack in Pakistan on Wednesday, a troubling development in a nation that remains one of three in the world where the disease has yet to be eradicated. Three workers were killed in separate attacks, a day after five others died in similar circumstances. All of them were part of a massive vaccination campaign nationwide. The attacks prompted authorities to suspend the campaign throughout the country.

All the attacks Wednesday took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province rife with Islamic extremists. On Tuesday, five workers were killed: four in Karachi; and a 14-year-old volunteer in Peshawar as she and her sister were leaving a house after administering vaccines. Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion after the CIA's use of a fake vaccination program last year to collect DNA samples from residents of Osama bin Laden's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence there. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011. In June, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, the Taliban said. CNN was not able to reach the Taliban for comment regarding the latest attacks. Polio, a highly infectious viral disease that can cause permanent paralysis in a matter of hours, has been eradicated around the world except for three countries where it is endemic: Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. After the number of cases spiked sharply last year, Pakistan stepped up its eradication efforts. The numbers fell from 173 last year to 53 this year, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Q: What occurs in a population when its allele frequencies change over time? Choices: - variation - generation - extinction - evolution A: The answer is:","completion":"Evolution When a population's allele frequencies change over time, the process is referred to as evolution. The term \\"evolution\\" generally refers to the dynamic changes that occur within a population's gene pool over a period of time. Gene pools consist of all the genes and their corresponding alleles found within a population. Altered allele frequencies in a population may lead to new characteristics or variations in that population, which can contribute to the evolution of a species. Several factors contribute to the change in allele frequencies in a population. Here is a more detailed and long explanation of some of these factors and their role in evolutionary processes: 1. Natural Selection: Natural selection is a significant mechanism driving evolution. It occurs when individuals with specific traits or characteristics that make them better adapted to their environment have a higher probability of survival and reproduction. These individuals pass on their advantageous traits to their offspring, thus favoring their presence in the population. 2. Genetic Drift: Genetic drift is another factor that contributes to the change in allele frequencies. It is a random process that involves changes in the gene pool due to chance events. For example, some individuals may not reproduce (or survive) while others may produce several offspring solely due to chance. In small populations, genetic drift has a more significant impact, which can lead to a loss of genetic variation and even extinction in extreme cases. 3. Migration: The movement of individuals between populations, or gene flow, can also cause changes in allele frequencies. When individuals from different populations interbreed, the gene pools of both populations are altered. In this way, the exchange of genetic material between populations can lead to evolution. 4. Mutation: Mutations are changes that occur in the genetic material (DNA) of an organism. While most mutations have no impact on the organism's fitness, some may give rise to new alleles that affect the organism's traits. Over time, these changes can contribute to the evolution of a population by introducing new genetic variations. 5. Non-random Mating: When individuals preferentially mate with others exhibiting certain characteristics, the frequency of those preferred characteristics may increase in the population. This process is called non-random mating or assortative mating, and it can lead to changes in allele frequencies. In summary, evolution is the process that occurs in a population when its allele frequencies change over time. Evolution can result from natural selection, genetic drift, migration, mutation, and non-random mating. These factors can contribute to the modification of a population's genetic makeup, which may lead to the emergence of new traits or characteristics and, ultimately, the development and diversification of species."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Father's Day originated in the United States and has since been adopted by many countries around the world, including the UK. It is important to note that Father's Day is not a public holiday in the UK, so regular working hours and schedules remain unaffected. The celebration of Father's Day in the UK is similar to how it is observed in the United States. Children and families come together to express their love, appreciation, and gratitude towards their fathers, stepdads, and father figures in various ways. Common activities and traditions for Father's Day in the UK include: 1. Giving cards or gifts: Children and families often give their fathers heartfelt cards or thoughtful gifts to show their appreciation. These can range from handmade crafts and personalized items to store-bought gadgets and clothing. 2. Spending quality time together: Many families choose to commemorate Father's Day by spending the day together, participating in activities that their father enjoys — this can include watching sports, going for a walk, taking a day trip, or simply spending time at home bonding over shared hobbies and interests. 3. Having a special meal: Families might prepare a special breakfast, lunch, or dinner for their father. This could involve cooking their dad's favorite meal, eating out at a preferred restaurant, or organizing a family barbecue. 4. Sending messages of love and appreciation: For those unable to spend the day with their father, sending messages of love, best wishes, and appreciation is a common tradition. This can be done through phone calls, video calls, or social media. Father's Day can also be a day to recognize and support men who have lost their children or those who have lost their own fathers, acknowledging their experiences and offering emotional support. Since Father's Day falls on different dates globally (with countries like Australia and New Zealand celebrating it on the first Sunday of September), it is crucial to remember that the third Sunday of June is when the United Kingdom specifically celebrates this important occasion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They boast over five hundred species of birds, and thousands of species of plants. Across the pond in England the situation is completely different. Centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have made it one of the least biodiverse place on Earth. and a hint : \\"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time.\\" Please answer this question : Would the ecosystem functions be less or more stable in Nicaragua than in England? Answer:","completion":"The ecosystem functions would likely be more stable in Nicaragua than in England. This is because Nicaragua has a higher level of biodiversity, which, as stated in the hint, increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time. Diverse communities, such as those found in Nicaragua, are more productive and resilient as they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and resource capture. In contrast, the lower biodiversity in England due to extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls may result in a less stable and less efficient ecosystem."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. Teacher:Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: jump around left twice and turn left thrice Student:","completion":"The solution would be: I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT. Here's how I solved it: - 'jump around left twice' means the agent should turn to the left, jump, then turn to the left again, and jump again. That's four actions in total, which translate into: I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP. - 'and' simply separates the two parts of the command, so we move onto the second part. - 'Turn left thrice' means the agent should turn to the left three times. That's three actions, which translate into: I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT. Putting these two parts together, you get seven actions: I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Asians are immigrating to Canada and the United States in larger numbers than ever believe that they can give their children a better education in the west. In Asia, especially in China, Japan, and Korea, it is difficult to go to university. Students must first pass the strict national examination. However, in Canada and the United States, it is easy to go to university, and anyone who wants to go can go. As a result, Asian parents decide to leave their countries so that their children can go to university. The problem is that when Asians arrive, they discover that finding a job and making money are more difficult in the West than in the East. Also, they find that they are very lonely, and that they miss their homes. Because of these two reasons, most Asian parents decide to go back to work while their children study in the West. Therefore, these two reasons, most Asian parents decide to go back to work while their children study in the west. Therefore, these children become satellite kids\\", and most of their parents do not know how sad it is to be a \\"satellite kid\\". Only until now are Canadians and Americans discovering the \\"satellite kids\\" problem. Because these children do mot speak English and because their parents are not there to take care of them, they are often absent from school. To be a \\"satellite kid\\" means growing up in a country where you know you are different and where you cannot make friends because you do not speak English well.

First, let's add 7513 and 382 together.

We can do that by subtracting 2688 from both sides: 7895 - 2688 = -127 * n 5207 = -127 * n Now we want to get \\"n\\" by itself. Since it is being multiplied by -127, we can divide by -127 on both sides to find out what \\"n\\" is: 5207 / -127 = n -41 = n There you go! The solution is n = -41.

The low down: 1. Crab Rangoons - This is usually an item I only have at Chinese/American food places a la Panda Expresses and mom pop's, but I really wanted deep fried cream cheese wontons. Bad decision. The wonton wrapper was not extra crispy deep fried, but actually tasted like it was baked. The filling was also too sweet. 2. Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp (level 5/10 spicy) - I enjoyed the soup's tangy and spicy robust flavors. 3. Duck Fried Rice (off menu) - For some reason, I really wanted duck fried rice, so I asked if this was available off menu. They did! This was pretty delish, but it still doesn't beat my favorite Thai fried rice of spicy basil fried rice. 4. Chicken Yellow Curry (spicy level 1/10) - This was good, but could have used more heat. We had to get it super mild because we had a little one with us. Next time, we'll get 5/10 spicy level. 5. Chicken Pad Thai (5/10 spicy) - I think this was the winner of the night. Just spicy enough.

Here is a premise: Lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something. Here is a hypothesis: They wouldn't even have to put on a show of doing it. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To examine whether the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, let's first analyze each statement. Premise: Lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something. In this premise, Lawrence believes that it is necessary for them to create an appearance or give the impression of engaging in some activity. It implies that there might be external factors, such as expectations from others or the need to satisfy a certain requirement, that have led Lawrence to conclude that putting on a show of action is essential. Hypothesis: They wouldn't even have to put on a show of doing it. This hypothesis suggests that the act of putting on a show is not, in fact, necessary. It could be interpreted in two ways: either the external factors highlighted in the premise are inessential, or there may be other more effective approaches to fulfill the obligation that Lawrence is trying to address. Now let's examine if the premise being true makes the hypothesis true. If we accept the premise (that Lawrence believes a show of action is necessary), it could be derived that Lawrence may not be aware of alternative approaches or consider all possible implications. However, the hypothesis counters Lawrence's belief by suggesting that putting on a show is not necessary. Therefore, if the premise is true, it doesn't necessarily lead to the hypothesis being true as well, since both statements present different viewpoints on whether putting on a show of doing something is required or not. In conclusion, the premise and the hypothesis represent contrasting perspectives, and the truth of the premise does not inherently validate the hypothesis. It is crucial to understand the context, reasons, and factors that have shaped Lawrence's opinion and to explore other possible solutions to determine the validity of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The result leaves Liverpool fifth in the Premier League table on 57 points with six games of the season to go, one point ahead of Southampton in sixth. Manchester City sit in fourth, on 61 points, with third-placed Manchester United a further four points ahead. This win against a disjointed Newcastle was far from a return to the fluid form that the Reds discovered at the start of 2015. Yet with Manchester City stalling above them, and three fixtures against teams in the bottom seven to follow, it was a result to fuel optimism after back-to-back league defeats against Manchester United and Arsenal. That may be tempered by a closer look at the league table and City's vastly superior goal difference - +31 compared to +11. For Newcastle, a fifth successive league defeat continues an end-of-season malaise that is unlikely to end in relegation, but will add to supporters' frustrations. Liverpool were lacking the and 39 goals down on the tally they had amassed at the same stage last year. But they started well, continually catching out Newcastle as Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, Jordon Ibe and Alberto Moreno swapped positions, taking it in turns to surge into the area. Sterling at least partially repaired some bruised relations with the home fans while simultaneously strengthening his bargaining position with an excellently taken goal. Isolated one on one with Taylor by Jordan Henderson's driven pass, he cut inside the full-back, dodged a half-hearted challenge from Gabriel Obertan and, with minimal back-lift, guided a curling shot into the far corner. The winger could have easily have had a hat-trick, with an open goal miss particularly glaring, but his profligacy ultimately did not cost his side and he departed to warm applause when substituted late on.

Preferences are generally learned characteristics, which means they are not predetermined by our genetic makeup but are developed through our experiences, culture, and environment. Among the options provided, skin color, nose shape, and hair color are predominantly determined by our genetic makeup and are inherited from our parents. Though there may be subtle differences throughout our lives due to environmental factors, the foundation of these traits is genetically determined. On the other hand, a person's favorite cookie variety is a learned trait, as it is a preference. Preferences are considered learned traits because they are influenced by personal experiences, cultural background, and social factors. For example, an individual may develop a preference for chocolate chip cookies because they have fond memories associated with eating them during childhood. On the other hand, another person may develop a preference for oatmeal raisin cookies due to dietary restrictions or simply because they enjoy the taste. These preferences are shaped over time and can change as the person experiences new flavors, learns about different types of cookies, and is exposed to various cultural norms. In conclusion, out of the given options, the learned trait would be favorite cookie variety because preferences are typically acquired through experiences and exposure to different factors, rather than being genetically determined.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation of having more magma move up while there are less lava flows from volcanoes can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. This is because the presence of more magma moving upwards increases the potential for volcanic activity, but it does not guarantee that more lava will flow from volcanoes. The process of magma reaching the Earth's surface and erupting as lava is influenced by various factors like pressure, the composition of the magma, and the tectonic forces at play. These factors determine whether or not the magma will erupt as lava. So, when more magma moves up, it can indirectly affect the step of magma erupting onto Earth's surface as lava. The increase in magma may increase the chances of an eruption, but it is not a direct cause-and-effect relationship, as the process of eruption depends on multiple factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: lirr killer claims he 's competent to stand trial Text:","completion":"Title: LIRR Killer's Insistence on Competency to Stand Trial Calls for Close Examination In a shocking turn of events, the man accused of the Long Island Rail Road massacre in which several passengers lost their lives, has recently claimed that he is competent enough to stand trial for his heinous crimes. The case has garnered national attention and raised questions about the process of determining the mental competence of defendants and the consequences faced by the legal system. The tragic incident that took place in the LIRR train sent shockwaves throughout the nation as the gruesome nature of the crime shook the very core of public safety. The alleged perpetrator of the attack, henceforth referred to as the LIRR Killer, exhibited a disturbing and cold-blooded nature that quickly raised concerns about his mental condition at the time of the crime. Since the incident unfolded, there have been several debates about the mental competency of the LIRR Killer and whether or not he should face trial. The legal system has a responsibility to ensure that defendants are mentally fit to stand for their alleged actions, and this obligation extends to cases as catastrophic as this one. The question of determining competency has posed a challenge to both legal and mental health professionals, who are required to balance the need for justice and the concerns for human rights. The recent confession from the LIRR Killer that he is indeed competent enough to stand trial has added fuel to the existing debates. Lawyers, psychiatrists, and other experts will now have to delve deeper into the defendant's claim and determine any underlying motives or hidden agendas that may be at play. The claim itself raises numerous questions: What factors should be taken into consideration when deciding the competency of a defendant? How can the legal and medical community ensure an impartial and fair trial for the accused under such challenging circumstances? What ramifications could this decision have on the wider public's perception of the criminal justice system? One cannot simply take the word of the LIRR Killer at face value. It is crucial that a team of mental health experts carefully assesses and evaluates his claim to competency. The court must establish a multispecialty task force, consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, legal professionals, and forensic experts, to conduct a thorough and unbiased investigation. This task force should look into the defendant's mental health history, any previous instances of manipulation, and analyze his current psychological condition. Additionally, they should assess his understanding of legal proceedings and whether he can partake meaningfully in his trial. Furthermore, it is essential that the legal system makes a conscious effort to provide a fair trial for the accused, even under the most egregious circumstances. The defendant's right to due legal process should be maintained throughout the proceedings, despite the severity of the crime or public opinion. Any decision made in haste or under pressure from external factors may inadvertently affect the integrity of the legal system and erode public trust. Lastly, stakeholders in the criminal justice system should be prepared to address the potential fallout that may arise from either outcome in the LIRR Killer's trial. If deemed competent, the defendant may use this decision as a platform to showcase his intentions or motivations, which could consequently induce panic among the general public. On the other hand, if found incompetent, there may be concerns about the effectiveness of the justice system in dealing with complex mental health issues. Legal and medical professionals must collaborate and create a comprehensive framework that addresses such scenarios efficiently and sensitively. In conclusion, the LIRR Killer's claim to competency warrants close examination by mental health experts, legal professionals, and forensic analysts. A fair trial should be ensured, and the criminal justice system has to be prepared to tackle the potential impact of the trial's outcome on public opinion and trust. The LIRR case serves as a sobering reminder of the significant responsibility placed on the legal system in balancing justice with the rights of the accused, regardless of the severity of the crimes committed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to babycenter.com, \\"a warm or stuffy room, the smell of heavy perfume, a car ride, or even certain visual stimuli, like flickering lights, might trigger your nausea.\\" Make a mental note every time your nausea is triggered, then you can make a conscious effort to avoid that trigger moving forward. Sudden movements can jolt your stomach and bring on a fresh wave of nausea, so try to move as slowly and carefully as possible. Take your time getting up in the morning - nibble a cracker while still lying down, move gently into a sitting position, then stay seated for a few minutes before standing up. Pace yourself throughout the day, don't overexert yourself. Set your alarm clock a half hour earlier than usual to give yourself plenty of time in the mornings. Try putting a little stool or seat in the shower, so you can avoid feeling light-headed. Sometimes the easiest and simplest solution is just to stop and give your body a break for a while. Try lying down, closing your eyes, taking a few deep breaths, and just getting some rest. Many women find that sleep is a great way to escape morning sickness - and it might be just what your body needs! If you already have a kids, bring a babysitter in, even if it's just for an hour or two, so you can catch up on some long overdue R&R. Having trouble nodding off during the day? Try wearing a sleep mask or putting on a pair of dark sunglasses to block out bright light. You may think that surfing the web will help take your mind off morning sickness, but the computer's bright screen and undetectable strobe effect may make you more nauseated. To combat that, try adjusting your screen to reduce eye strain. Try changing the font size to make it bolder and larger, and change the desktop background to a soft pink or tan. You should also take short breaks from the computer as frequently as possible -- you can do this by getting up and moving around or simply by closing your eyes. Escape from the stuffy indoors and head outside for some fresh air and light exercise. Breathe deeply through the nose, then exhale through the mouth. Clean, country or seaside air is best, but your garden or a nearby park will also do nicely. If you're stuck indoors, try opening a window to let the stale air out and the fresh air circulate. Nausea can be difficult to ignore, but finding something to take your mind off it - even for a little while - can help. Read a magazine, call a friend, or go for a short walk. Light exercise, such as yoga or gentle swimming may also help to ease nausea, but you should get any exercise plans approved by your doctor first. It's also important to listen to your body -- if you start feeling tired or more queasy, it's time to stop. It's a smart idea to put together a little survival kit for yourself for those emergency situations when you're not at home. Pack a toothbrush and toothpaste, some mints and a clean blouse. You could also include a snack such as crackers or pretzels, and a plastic bag for when you just can't make it to a restroom on time. If you just can't seem to find any relief from your morning sickness, go to see your doctor. Ask about anti-nausea medications, which can help ease or eliminate your suffering. A small percentage of women may also develop a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum, which is an extreme form of morning sickness which causes extreme dehydration and weight loss. If you think you may be at risk, contact your health care provider immediately. Some anti-nausea medications may not be covered under insurance plans and can be costly - so consider the expense before getting a prescription. Summary:","completion":"To cope with morning sickness and nausea, make a mental note of your triggers and try to avoid them. Move slowly and carefully to avoid jolting your stomach, and allow yourself extra time in the morning to wake up gradually.

As if getting into a serious motorcycle accident wasn’t scary enough, suddenly the former heavyweight champion of the world was approaching him, but Mike was there to help. While traveling onto the on-ramp on I-15 North off Flamingo Road in Las Vegas Tuesday night, Chesley was involved in a nasty motorcycle crash after a cab cut him off from the left lane, his attorney Stephen Stubbs told the Daily News. The victim was sent flying off his bike and suffered several injuries including a paralyzed big toe, broken ankle and torn muscles and ligaments, Stubbs said. Chesley will also need surgery, he said. But when he was lying on the roadway, he looked up and saw Mike Tyson with three friends offering their help. The group blocked off traffic, and “Iron Mike” sat with Chesley and spoke with him in a soft voice to keep him from going into shock, Stubbs said. “He looked up and saw Mike Tyson,” Stubbs said. “He was saying ‘don’t worry, don’t worry,’ people are coming.’” Ryan Chesley sent this fruit basket to Mike Tyson for helping Chesley get back up after a motorcycle accident in Las Vegas. (Courtesy of Stephen Stubbs) Chesley does not know how long they were there, but he thought he might be hallucinating, his attorney said. He grabbed his camera with his uninjured hand and took a picture, he said. “He didn’t know what was happening,” Stubbs said. “(Mike) just stood by him and talked to him. When he was done with the good deed, he just took off.” Tyson is known for his bizarre behavior — including biting off a chunk of Evander Holyfield's ear in 1997 — but he appears to have acted quickly and responsibly in this instance. Chesley was so grateful for Mike’s help, he reached out to his representatives to send a thank-you note and fruit basket. \\"It has to be the most reassuring thing in the world to have Mike Tyson telling people not to touch me,\\" Chesley wrote. Grateful motorcyclist Ryan Chesley also sent this thank-you letter, along with a fruit basket, to Mike Tyson after the former boxer came to his aid after the accident. (Handout) “”He wanted to say thank you,” Stubbs said. “We asked if we could send chocolates but his rep said ‘no, he’s a health nut.’ We sent him a fruit basket because he is into antioxidants.” A representative for the eccentric boxer who grew up in Brooklyn confirmed the note and fruit basket were sent over. Tyson was not available Monday for a statement, the representative said. “Iron Mike” has recently been performing a one-man show about his life, and the 48-year-old continues to make headlines. He recently used vulgar language in front of a TV news reporter during a live interview in Canada. The journalist had asked Mike about his rape conviction in 1992. jlandau@nydailynews.com Follow on Twitter @joelzlandau ||||| Mike Tyson Comes to Rescue of Motorcycle Crash Victim Mike Tyson -- Comes to Rescue of Motorcycle Crash Victim EXCLUSIVE When you need a calm, soothing voice to get you through a traumatic event, you don't think of... but that's exactly what happened to a motorcycle crash victim.Ryan Chesley tells TMZ ... he was on his way to Las Vegas this week when a cab cut him off on the freeway ... sending him flying off his chopper.Chesley says Tyson saw the whole thing ... slammed on his brakes and stopped traffic.

After three days in captivity, fourteen officers are released, but one is murdered. The police find a tape recording and a file on the dead officer's body that provide significant evidence about the kidnapping and subsequent murder. The file suggests that the crimes were committed by members of the self-proclaimed \\"Anti-Corruption Force\\" (A.C.F.), a citizen militia seeking to eliminate corruption through vigilante means. The militia, acting as a kangaroo court, had \\"sentenced\\" corrupt officials in the area to death, beginning with the captured revenue officers who were apparently engaging in criminal activity.

While visiting his adopted child at the hospital, Ramanaa discovers that the officials at the facility are engaging in extortion and fraud. After collecting evidence of the hospital staff's deception, Ramanaa turns them over to the authorities. The plot ringleader is the hospital dean, who commits suicide upon discovery. His grief-stricken father, a local construction magnate named Bhadrinarayanan, vows to take revenge on the man responsible for his son's death.

News article: Trump wins big in SC primary as Bush bows out; Clinton edges Sanders in Nev. Donald Trump charges into Nevada and the mega-March primaries with a commanding lead over the GOP field after sweeping to victory Saturday in the South Carolina primary – while Hillary Clinton can breathe a sigh of relief that her firewall held just enough to beat back Bernie Sanders in Nevada, as they head to Palmetto State territory. The outcome of Saturday’s contests helps both 2016 “front-runners” regain their footing after going one-for-one in the leadoff contests. But there are potential hurdles ahead. The big question now looming over the GOP race is: With Jeb Bush suspending his campaign on the heels of a distant finish Saturday, where will his supporters go? At his victory rally, Trump challenged pundits who say such votes will gravitate to his rivals. The billionaire businessman sounded a booming note of confidence as he previewed the race ahead. “Let’s put this thing away,” Trump told cheering supporters. Reflecting on the rough-and-tumble primary, which gave him a 10-point margin of victory, Trump also said, “When you win, it’s beautiful. “ Clinton heads into the next round in a more fragile – albeit improved – position. Clinton has watched her lead in national polls essentially evaporate after losing big in New Hampshire. Her showing in Nevada marks a crucial victory, and she enjoys a significant advantage heading into next weekend’s South Carolina primary. “I am so, so thrilled and so grateful to all of my supporters,” Clinton said at her Las Vegas victory rally. SOUTH CAROLINA GOP PRIMARY RESULTS But her 5-point margin of victory may not be enough, at this stage, to significantly blunt Sanders’ momentum. The Vermont senator maintained he has an “excellent chance” to score some big wins in the upcoming Super Tuesday contests. The Palmetto State, meanwhile, delivered a huge victory Saturday night on the Republican side to Trump -- while Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were locked in a tight race for second. Cruz nevertheless gave a fiery speech to supporters, as the senator touted his campaign’s ability to defy “expectations” and maintained that he’s the best candidate to go up against Clinton or Sanders “or whatever other socialist they nominate” on the Democratic side. “Indeed, the screaming you hear now from across the Potomac is the Washington cartel in full terror that the conservative grassroots are rising up,” Cruz said, while suggesting he’s the only candidate who can beat Trump. Rubio, for his part, declared: “After tonight, this has become a three-person race, and we will win the nomination.” Rubio was in need of a recovery after stumbling in New Hampshire following a rough debate performance earlier this month. He had vowed to bounce back, and was buoyed in South Carolina by support from the state's popular governor, Nikki Haley, and other state leaders. With Bush now out of the race, Ohio Gov. John Kasich is the only governor left standing on the GOP side. It remains unclear where his supporters will go. The only other candidate left is retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who vowed to press on. The GOP race heads next to Nevada and after that to Super Tuesday, representing a delegate gold mine. Even South Carolina, with 50 delegates, is the most valuable GOP primary to date. As the winner, Trump would get the lion's share. South Carolina, historically, also is a prized contest for Republican candidates as it has a knack for picking the eventual nominee – the primary winner has gone on to claim the nomination in every race since 1980, except for 2012 when Newt Gingrich won. The race tightened in the final days, but not enough to shake Trump's long-time advantage there. Fox News exit polls indicate significant numbers of late-deciding voters ended up supporting Cruz and Rubio, causing both candidates to perform more strongly than pre-election polling suggested. Clinton’s Nevada win comes just a week-and-a-half after she lost to Sanders by double-digits in New Hampshire. \\"To everyone who turned out in every corner of Nevada with determination and heart: This is your win. Thank you,\\" Clinton tweeted after the race was called. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1. Donald Trump won the South Carolina primary, while Hillary Clinton narrowly defeated Bernie Sanders in the Nevada caucuses. 2. Trump's victory strengthens his position as the GOP front-runner, leading into the Nevada caucus and Super Tuesday contests. 3. Jeb Bush suspended his campaign after a poor showing in the South Carolina primary, raising questions about where his supporters will go. 4. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were locked in a tight race for second place in the South Carolina primary, with both candidates declaring themselves well-positioned to challenge Trump for the nomination. 5. Clinton's win in Nevada helps to regain some footing after her loss in New Hampshire, but her relatively narrow victory suggests that Sanders' momentum remains strong as they head into the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Following the Mamluk victory over the Mongols in 1260 at the Battle of Ain Jalut by Qutuz and his general Baibars, Qutuz was assassinated, leaving Baibars to claim the sultanate for himself. As Sultan, Baibars proceeded to attack the Christian crusaders at Arsuf, Athlith, Haifa, Safad, Jaffa, Ascalon, and Caesarea. As the Crusader fortress cities fell one by one, the Christians sought help from Europe, but assistance was slow in coming. In 1268 Baibars captured Antioch, thereby destroying the last remnant of the Principality of Antioch, securing the Mamluk northern front and threatening the small Crusader County of Tripoli. Louis IX of France, having already organized a large crusader army with the intent of attacking Egypt, was diverted instead to Tunis, where Louis himself died in 1270. Prince Edward of England arrived in Tunis too late to contribute to the remainder of the crusade in Tunis. Instead, he continued on his way to the Holy Land to assist Bohemund VI, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli, against the Mamluk threat to Tripoli and the remnant of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. On May 9, 1271, Edward finally arrived at Acre. He brought a small but not insignificant contingent of no more than 1,000 men, including 225 knights.

Question: Why was the Yashiromaru sunk fifteen years earlier? Title: Case Closed: Strategy Above the Depths Movie plot: The 9th annual Detective Conan movie sets sail on a 100 million yen luxurious cruise. Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogorou shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \\"gold medal\\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area.It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogorou, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi.

But, when British Rail offered him an all-expenses-paid birthday trip to the capital he just could not refuse. He arrived at Paddington Station and smartly turned out in his best suit, favorite Panama hat and a red rose in his buttonhole. \\"It's very exciting. There's no doubt about it,\\" he said. Until yesterday he had never been far from home, except for one trip to Aberdeen. \\"But I've been on the seas to that faraway land called Ilfracombe 21 miles from home,\\" he joked. Mr Evans, who spent 60 years working as a miner in South Wales, almost made the journey to London once before, at the turn of the century. \\"There was a trip to the White City but it was ten shillings return from Swansea -- too much I thought. All my money went to the family then,\\" he said. During the next two days Mr. Evans will be taken on a short tour of London to see the sights. Top of his list is a visit to the House of Parliament organized by his MP, Mr. Gareth Wardell. The only arrangement he does not care for is the wheelchair provided for him if he gets tired. \\"I don't like the chair -- people will think I am getting old. \\" he said. His secret for a long and healthy life has been well publicized -- no wine, no tobacco and no anger. Before setting off from Swansea with his 76-year-old son, Amwell, he said jokingly, \\"I'm glad to see they've given me a return ticket. \\" The answer to this question is:","completion":"Which of the following best describes Mr. John Evans' first visit to London? A. He visited London at the age of 50 and paid for the trip himself. B. He was offered an all-expenses-paid trip to London by British Rail at the age of 101. C. He visited London regularly throughout his life. D. He had always lived in London and never left the city. Answer: B. He was offered an all-expenses-paid trip to London by British Rail at the age of 101."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The patient was curious and started to consider taking it. Next, the kind doctor brought out a small cup of fruit juice and poured it into a cute, animal-shaped cup. He added a fun, twisty straw and told the patient that if they took the multivitamin, they could also drink this tasty fruit juice from the special cup, which would make it easier to swallow and taste much better. The patient, now feeling excited about the juice and the magical rainbow stone, agreed to take the multivitamin. They put it in their mouth and, with the doctor's encouragement, drank the fruit juice from the fun cup. Soon, the multivitamin was swallowed, and the patient was proud of their bravery. From then on, the little patient always looked forward to taking their multivitamin with the help of the kind doctor and their playful, imaginative ways. They felt like a superhero, growing stronger and healthier every day with their magical rainbow stone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The purpose of the game is to ask someone (solo, or a member of a group) 21 questions, all of which must be answered honestly. Although it can be played with friends you’ve had for a while, it is usually best to choose someone you don’t know as well, or someone you want to get to know on a deeper level. If you do not have a new acquaintance or romantic interest, tailor your questions to suit getting to know someone more deeply. Once you’ve chosen a person to ask questions of, identify what it is you want to know about them. If you’ve chosen a friend, do you want to know more about their background, or are you more interested in their future plans? If you’ve chosen a romantic partner, do you want to know about their dating history, or do you want to know how they feel about your relationship? If you are playing in a group, you can decide as a group what types of questions to ask. This can be tailored to each target, or there can be an overall theme for the game. There are two ways to play: the first involves people asking whatever questions come to mind, and asking them at random. The second has the pair (or group) come up with a set list of questions which are then posed to each person. Writing a list beforehand is the easier choice, as everyone knows what they will be asked, and will likely agree to answer. Asking at random may be the more entertaining choice, but is also at higher risk of getting too personal or inappropriate. If you decide to play this game with strangers or acquaintances you meet in a specific setting, you may want to take that setting into consideration when forming some or all of your questions. If meeting with members of a book club or writer's group, you might ask questions like, “What is your favorite book?” or “If you could be any fictional character from any book, who would you be?” If meeting with a church group, consider questions such as, “What is your favorite Bible verse/story?” or “When did you first develop an interest in religion?” If meeting someone new at the grand opening of a coffee shop, consider questions like “What is your favorite snack to enjoy with coffee?” or “Would you rather give up coffee for a month or stop showering for a week?” Although many of the people playing 21 Questions use is as a method to ask probing or otherwise inappropriate questions, respect the privacy of the person being asked questions--particularly in a group of people. If they want to sidestep something, or answer in vague terms, allow them to do so. The golden rule is a great thing to keep in mind when playing this game. Treat the target the same way you’d like to be treated during your turn as a target. There are some questions that should not be asked in any circumstance. Before you begin the game, identify any questions that might be too inconsiderate, thoughtless, or crude to ask. These questions can include broad categories such as sex and intimacy, or can be specific questions, such as, “Have you ever committed a crime?” You can also create guidelines about the sort of questions being asked based by theme. For instance, if playing 21 Questions at a church youth group, you might indicate that at least half of the questions must be religious in nature. There may be a question that is just too probing or intimate for someone to answer. To safeguard against people getting upset, make a rule before starting the game for these instances. A simple rule could be that a target can pass on a question, but must then be asked a question in its place, or that the target can pass on a question, but will forfeit their turn to ask the next target a question. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is basically telling you about a game called 21 Questions. In this game, you ask someone 21 questions, and they must answer honestly. It's a fun way to get to know someone better, especially if they're someone you don't know very well. You can play with a group of friends, a romantic partner, or even with strangers. The game can be played by asking random questions or making a list of questions beforehand.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: how do you keep your phone screen from cracking if you drop it? Pick from: -- put a cloth over it.; -- put a glass screen protector on it.;","completion":"The correct answer is: -- put a glass screen protector on it. A glass screen protector is designed to protect your phone’s screen from cracking if you drop it. The protector takes most of the impact, leaving your actual screen unharmed. High-quality protectors can even improve screen clarity and sensitivity. The other option, putting a cloth over it, would likely provide minimal protection in the event of a fall. A cloth is not designed to absorb the shock of a fall in the same way as a screen protector and is likely to slip off, offering no protection against impact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ian found the camera that Ryan had lost at the beach, so","completion":"Ian found the camera that Ryan had lost at the beach, so he decided to meticulously clean the device, carefully removing any sand or debris that may have lodged itself in its delicate components, all while preserving the memory card containing the cherished moments captured. Once satisfied with its condition, Ian thought about the best course of action to ensure that the camera would be safely returned to its rightful owner, Ryan. First, Ian considered sending Ryan a text message to inform him about the found camera. However, knowing that the beach was a popular spot for tourists and that Ryan might not receive the message promptly, Ian decided to explore other options. He recalled that Ryan was staying at a nearby hotel and thought it would be a good idea to contact the hotel's reception desk to pass along the information. Before heading to the hotel, Ian searched for clues that might help the hotel staff to verify that the camera indeed belonged to Ryan. He browsed through the photos stored on the device and found a picture of Ryan posing with a group of friends in front of the hotel. Additionally, the group was holding a sign with the name \\"Ryan's Beach Vacation Extravaganza.\\" Ian took note of these details, intending to share them with the hotel staff in order to help confirm the camera's ownership. Upon arrival at the hotel, Ian approached the reception desk and explained the situation to the receptionist. He shared the visual evidence he had found on the camera and requested the staff's assistance to locate Ryan. The receptionist cautiously took the camera and carefully examined it. After verifying Ian's claims and cross-checking it with their in-house records of Ryan's stay, the receptionist agreed to store the camera in their lost and found area while using the hotel's communication system to contact Ryan. Meanwhile, Ian returned to his activities, feeling a sense of accomplishment for his good deed. He hoped that the camera would bring a wave of relief and happiness to Ryan, who was surely worried about the lost memories contained within. Shortly after, Ryan received a call from the hotel's receptionist, informing him about the recovered camera. Thrilled, Ryan rushed to the hotel lobby, thanked the hotel staff, and asked about the kind person who had found his precious camera. Upon learning Ian's name, Ryan was deeply grateful and decided to give his thanks to Ian personally. When Ryan and Ian finally met face to face, they shared a heartfelt conversation about the importance of creating and preserving cherished memories through photographs. Their shared experience inspired Ryan to take even more pictures to document the rest of his vacation, while Ian left with the satisfaction of a good deed done and a newfound appreciation for photography. As an unexpected outcome, their encounter also laid the foundation for an unexpected friendship. Ian and Ryan stayed in touch long after their initial meeting, bonding over their shared interests and experiences. Their story became emblematic of the enduring bonds that can be formed through the simplest acts of kindness - illustrating how the lost can become found, both in terms of material possessions and meaningful connections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She later found out that she'd been infected with HIV. Jill was scared and helped her as much as she could. Which friend has a virus that is transmitted contact with infected blood? A:","completion":"Monica Monica and Jill are good friends who often study and party together. One day, Monica made a dangerous decision by sharing a needle with a drug addict at a party. Unfortunately, this action led to her contracting HIV. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system, specifically CD4 cells (T cells), which help the immune system fight off infections. The virus can be spread through various means, including sexual contact, breastfeeding, and sharing needles or other drug injection equipment with someone who is infected. In this situation, Monica was the one who shared a needle with a person who was infected with HIV, which led to her contracting the virus. Jill, on the other hand, remains infection-free. It is crucial for people to understand the risks and methods of transmission associated with HIV and take appropriate precautions to prevent infection. Jill's decision to help Monica in any way she could is an example of true friendship and compassionate care. It is essential for Monica to seek professional medical help and treatment to manage this lifelong condition. Meanwhile, Jill can support her friend by learning more about HIV, offering emotional support, and encouraging her to follow a proper treatment plan. In conclusion, Monica is the friend who contracted the virus that is transmitted through contact with infected blood. It is a crucial reminder to abstain from practices that put individuals at risk of contracting HIV, including sharing needles with others. It is essential for everyone, including friends and family members, to provide support, understanding, and assistance to individuals living with HIV, and work together to minimize the stigma surrounding the disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process: - Air is taken through the mouth - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body. Question: suppose less virus enters a body happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen reaching the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"No effect To understand the reasoning behind this answer, let's first analyze the steps you've mentioned for the process of oxygen reaching the body, which essentially explains the process of respiration. 1. Air is taken through the mouth or nose. 2. The air travels through the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and finally enters the lungs. 3. Oxygen from the inhaled air fills the tiny sacs in the lungs, called alveoli, where the gas exchange takes place. 4. Carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, is removed from the lungs and exhaled. 5. The oxygen is then transported by hemoglobin present in red blood cells throughout the body to reach cells and tissues. Now, let's address the hypothetical situation where fewer viruses enter a body. Specifically, we will consider the respiratory system, as it is the primary focus of the given situation. Understandably, an infected person would experience various respiratory symptoms, which could include coughing, difficulty breathing, and congestion. Even with these symptoms, the effect of fewer viruses on the flow of oxygen reaching the body will be minimal or nonexistent in most situations. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the body's immune system responds adequately to the viral infection and prevents it from overwhelming the respiratory system. Furthermore, healthy and uninfected alveoli will still be able to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, ensuring the body receives the oxygen it needs. Therefore, the proposed perturbation – fewer viruses entering the body – would have no significant effect on the ability of more oxygen to reach the lungs and be transported throughout the body. The respiratory system would likely remain functional and capable of maintaining normal oxygen levels, particularly if the individual has a generally healthy immune response and no extenuating factors that could exacerbate the consequences of viral infection. It's essential to note that this conclusion might not hold for every individual or in every circumstance, as the impact of respiratory viral infections can vary significantly among people with different health conditions, immune responses, or viral loads. However, for the general population, the stated perturbation should have no substantial effect on the process of respiration and oxygen delivery to the body's cells and tissues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Information: - Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the European honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea, presently considered as a clade Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven to nine recognized families, though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants. - A gill is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment. - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments. - The Chalcididae are a moderate-sized family within the Chalcidoidea, composed mostly of parasitoids and a few hyperparasitoids. The family is apparently polyphyletic, though the different subfamilies may each be monophyletic, and some may be elevated to family status in the near future. As presently defined, there are over 85 genera and over 1455 species worldwide. They are often black with yellow, red, or white markings, rarely brilliantly metallic, with a robust mesosoma and very strong sculpturing. The hind femora are often greatly enlarged, with a row of teeth or serrations along the lower margin. - A proleg is a small, fleshy, stub structure found on the ventral surface of the abdomen of most larval forms of insects of the order Lepidoptera, though they can also be found on other larval insects such as sawflies and a few types of flies. In all the orders in which they appear, mainly Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera, prolegs of any form evolved independently of each other by convergent evolution. - Arachnids are a class (Arachnida) of joint-legged invertebrate animals (arthropods), in the subphylum Chelicerata. All arachnids have eight legs, although the front pair of legs in some species has converted to a sensory function, while in other species, different appendages can grow large enough to take on the appearance of extra pairs of legs. The term is derived from the Greek word (\\"aráchn\\"), meaning \\"spider\\". Spiders are the largest order in the class. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - The mesosoma is the middle part of the body, or tagma, of arthropods whose body is composed of three parts, the other two being the prosoma and the metasoma. It bears the legs, and, in the case of winged insects, the wings. - The ovipositor is an organ used by some animals for the laying of eggs. In insects an ovipositor consists of a maximum of three pairs of appendages. The details and morphology of the ovipositor vary, but typically its form is adapted to functions such as transmitting the egg, preparing a place for it, and placing it properly. In some insects the organ is used merely to attach the egg to some surface, but in many parasitic species (primarily in wasps and other Hymenoptera) it is a piercing organ as well. - The Archaeognatha are an order of wingless insects, also known as jumping bristletails. They are among the least evolutionarily changed insects, appearing in the Middle Devonian period along with the arachnids. They are known from both body and trace fossils (the latter including body imprints and trackways) throughout the remainder of the Paleozoic Era. The name Archaeognatha is derived from Greek, \\"archaeos\\" meaning \\"ancient\\" and \\"gnatha\\" meaning \\"jaw\\". This refers to the articulation of the mandibles, which has a single condyle, where all higher insects have two. An alternative name, Microcoryphia, comes from the Greek \\"micro\\", meaning \\"small\\", and \\"coryphia\\", meaning head. - A wasp is any insect of the order Hymenoptera and suborder Apocrita that is neither a bee nor an ant. The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a clade; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are paraphyletic with respect to bees and ants. - A carapace is a dorsal (upper) section of the exoskeleton or shell in a number of animal groups, including arthropods, such as crustaceans and arachnids, as well as vertebrates, such as turtles and tortoises. In turtles and tortoises, the underside is called the plastron. - The metasoma is the posterior part of the body, or tagma, of arthropods whose body is composed of three parts, the other two being the prosoma and the mesosoma. In insects, it contains most of the digestive tract, respiratory system, and circulatory system, and the apical segments are typically modified to form genitalia. In a few of the most primitive insects (the Archaeognatha), the metasomal segments bear small, articulated appendages called \\"styli\\", which are often considered to be vestigial. There are also pre-apical appendages in most insect orders, called cerci, which may be multi-segmented and almost resembling a posterior pair of antennae; these may be variously modified, or lost entirely. Otherwise, most adult insects lack appendages on the metasoma, though many larval insects (e.g., caterpillars) have some form of appendages, such as prolegs or, in aquatic insects, gills. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - The Leucospidae ( sometimes incorrectly spelled Leucospididae ) are a small , specialized group within the Chalcidoidea , composed exclusively of ectoparasitoids of aculeate wasps or bees . They are typically mimics of bees or stinging wasps , often black with yellow , red , or white markings , sometimes metallic , with a robust mesosoma and very strong sculpturing . The hind femora are often greatly enlarged , with a row of teeth or serrations along the lower margin as in Chalcididae . The female ovipositor is sometimes short , but if not , it is recurved and lies along the dorsal side of the metasoma , a unique feature . The males are also unusual , in the fusion of many of the metasomal segments to form a capsule - like \`\` carapace '' . Leucospids are generally rarely encountered except in areas where their hosts are abundant ; in the United States , the most common species is Leucospis affinis , which attacks nests of leafcutter bees .

'The mother was able to get away from the pit bull and barricade herself in a bedroom where she screamed for help and handed over her 4-year-old child through a window to medical personnel,' Duplantis said in a statement. According to police, the attack happened inside the family home. 'She was screaming for help,' Duplantis said of the desperate mother's 911 call. Mia suffered facial and head injuries in the pit bull attack and was rushed to Terrebonne General Medical Center but didn't make it. Touchet suffered moderate injuries and was hospitalized as well. She remains in hospital today. Duplantis did not know whether the girl was on a sofa or chair or on the floor when she was attacked. Vicious attack: Mia, pictured with her dad Chris, was pounced on by the dog, one of two at her mom's home in the Houma Highland Apartments. The animal, named Niko, was shot dead by police before they were able to enter the apartment. Duplantis described it as 'a monster,' in a Wednesday afternoon press conference. They reported that it was 'running loose inside the apartment acting in a very vicious manner' and officers shot it three times to 'eliminate the threat of additional injuries.' 'It's a traumatic event,' said Terrebonne Parish President Michel Claudet told WWLTV.com Wednesday. Mia would have celebrated her fifth birthday next week.

Two groups of students went to the forest to explore nature and learn botany. Group D had some people experiencing mild allergy symptoms, and group C had a few folks with severe allergy symptoms, so they had to call the ambulance asap. Which group had more people that could be treated with antihistamines? Hint: Allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms might include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Severe symptoms can cause difficulty breathing, which may be life threatening. Keep in mind that it is the immune system and not the allergen that causes the allergy symptoms. Allergy symptoms can be treated with medications such as antihistamines. Severe allergic reactions may require an injection of the hormone epinephrine. These treatments lessen or counter the immune system’s response. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Group D. Both groups likely experienced allergic reactions, and antihistamines are typically used to treat mild to moderate symptoms, such as itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Group D had people with mild allergy symptoms, which are more suitable for treatment with antihistamines. In contrast, group C had a few individuals with severe allergy symptoms, which required immediate attention and might necessitate more potent interventions such as epinephrine injections. While antihistamines could be used to alleviate some of the less severe symptoms in group C, the presence of severe reactions in this group would likely necessitate more urgent treatments beyond antihistamines. Therefore, group D had more people that could be treated with antihistamines effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Premise: \\"He had made the stance his own now, not the strict stance of the duelmasters of the north but his own relaxed stance prepared for any attack that might come his way.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"He stood in his own way to be ready for any attacks.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"He stood in his own way to be ready for any attacks.\\" can be considered largely true with some elaboration. The phrase \\"stood in his own way\\" might be more accurately phrased as \\"adopted his own stance\\" in this context. The premise describes a character who has developed a unique and personal battle stance, deviating from the traditional and strict techniques typically taught by duelmasters in the north. By creating his own stance, the character has effectively tailored his fighting style to be adaptable and versatile, enabling him to deal with a wide range of potential threats and attacks. This adaptive approach reflects the character's readiness to face any challenges that come his way, regardless of the type or origin of the threat. By distancing himself from the rigid and often predictable nature of the traditional stance, the character demonstrates an understanding that combat scenarios may vary and that a more agile and flexible approach may be better suited to his individual strengths, preferences, and needs. Therefore, while the phrasing of the hypothesis may benefit from some modification to better align with the premise, the overall idea that the character is prepared to face any type of attack stands true. His unique stance enables him to be more responsive and adaptable in combat, allowing for greater success in facing and overcoming any challenges he may encounter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Your teacher is not just standing up for their health; they are trying to educate you. Give them respect. Show them that they have your full attention, by looking them in the eye, and listening. Try your best to look alert. If you feel your eyes averting to something else in the room, catch yourself and focus back on your teacher. Your teacher should have your full attention at all times during class. Your eyes should not be drifting elsewhere. Most teachers tell you the subject of the class and the objective they are aiming for you to learn. If possible, write down this objective the minute you hear it. What is it that needs to be done today? What will you be learning about? How can you remain alert and focused during this time? Set goals for yourself, and remind yourself of the objective throughout class. This way, you know exactly what you have to do. . By taking accurate notes, you'll be able to \\"get into\\" the lesson. Recognize key points as your teacher speaks, and listen for key phrases such as \\"This is important,\\" \\"This is the main idea,\\" and \\"This will be on the test,\\", for example. This can alert you to listen more intently; you'll have something to do and focus on. Objectives: If your teacher normally writes down the lesson's objective at the beginning of the class, keep it in your head and make sure you've achieved it by the end of the lesson. Don't try to finish up old notes or homework in class. Do that later, when you have free time or else you might miss key points. This is a wonderful way to become a more focused, successful student. When a teacher asks a question, offer to answer it. If she/he asks for an opinion, share your own. This shows that the teacher that you're listening intently during the class and that you know your stuff. This can also help you avoid those embarrassing moments, when you get called on and you happen to not be paying attention. Also, teachers will note to college officers that you are actively contributing in class. If you don't understand something, never be afraid to ask. This really shows your teacher that you want to learn and can recognize the things you're having difficulty with. Chances are, someone else in the class has the same question and may have been afraid to ask. When you walk into that classroom, put a smile on your face and some confidence in your pocket. Be the best that you can be at all times, and show your true potential.

Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Input: Passage: The gender of God may be viewed as either a literal or an allegorical aspect of a deity who, in classical western philosophy, transcends bodily form. Polytheistic religions commonly attribute to each of the gods a gender, allowing each to interact with any of the others, and perhaps with humans, sexually. In most monotheistic religions, God has no counterpart with which to relate sexually. Thus, in classical western philosophy the gender of this one-and-only deity is most likely to be an analogical statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other. Namely, God is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active (as opposed to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse.

Title: A disappointment Product review: I thought all dvd/vcr combos were probably pretty much the same. I had a Sharp which I liked but needed to get another for my the teens' tv room. The Zenith was on sale. I don't use it much but here's what I don't like about it so far: programming is a pain. You can't use the number pad, and unlike even my 5-year-old VCR, you have to use up and down keys for the hour&minutes combined (that is, you push the up arrow and it goes from 12:00 to 12:01, up and it goes 12:01 to 12:02, etc. you can't separate the hour from the minutes for faster programming). On my Sharp, I can use either the number pad (with hour & minute separated) or the up & down arrows. In addition, it seems to have little versatility on rewind or FF. The same DVD which I can rewind in tiny segments on my Sharp can only be rewound (or fast forward) in big chunks on the Zenith. I have a feeling that Zenith is using the oldest available technology. The pathetic thing is that it cost just as much as my Sharp. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?

Consecrated in 1962, where is the Cathedral Church of St Michael????","completion":"The Cathedral Church of St. Michael, also known as Coventry Cathedral, is located in Coventry, England. Consecrated in 1962, the cathedral is a stunning and powerful symbol of hope, peace, and reconciliation, as well as an architectural marvel. Before delving into the cathedral's unique history and features, it's essential to understand that there are actually two St. Michael's Cathedrals in Coventry. The older and original St. Michael's Cathedral, a 14th-century Gothic church, was almost entirely destroyed during World War II. On November 14, 1940, a German bombing raid severely damaged Coventry, including the original cathedral. Only the tower, spire, and a few outer walls remained standing after the attack. Instead of rebuilding the old cathedral, the decision was made to keep the ruins intact as a memorial to the sufferings of war and construct a new cathedral next to it. A competition was organized to select a design for the new cathedral, and the winning architect was Sir Basil Spence. Spence's modern design for the new cathedral incorporated the ruins of the old one, creating a symbolic union between the old and new. Spence also envisioned that the two buildings would work in harmony to communicate the themes of destruction, reconciliation, and hope. The construction of the new St. Michael's Cathedral started in 1956, and it was consecrated on May 25, 1962. One of the main features of the new cathedral is its huge stained-glass windows, created by English artist John Piper, that run almost the full length and height of the nave. The windows, referred to as the \\"Baptistry Window,\\" display a stunning range of colors: blues, greens, reds, and yellows, representing the creation of the world. Another remarkable artwork in the cathedral is \\"The Tapestry of Christ,\\" designed by Graham Sutherland and situated in the altar area. This tapestry stands 75 ft high and 38 ft wide, depicting Christ in glory, surrounded by angels. The new cathedral is also home to several chapels, including the Chapel of Unity, where worshippers from different Christian denominations gather to promote peace and unity within the religious community. The cathedral plays a significant role in supporting numerous global reconciliation projects, and it frequently welcomes international peacebuilding groups and visitors. In conclusion, the Cathedral Church of St. Michael, or Coventry Cathedral, is located in Coventry, England. The old cathedral, a Gothic church from the 14th century, was almost completely destroyed during World War II, leading to the construction of the new cathedral built alongside the ruins in a showcase of modern architectural design. The new cathedral was consecrated in 1962, and it is now a symbol of hope, peace, and reconciliation that reflects Coventry's resilience and commitment to healing and unity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk. Situated on the corner of Tottenham High Road and Chesnut Road, the factory sat opposite Tottenham Police Station, which was under the control of the Metropolitan Police.Special Branch suspected another individual, the Russian revolutionary Christian Salnish, of having organised the robbery.

He participated in the 1905 Russian Revolution and afterwards helped to build resistance groups in the Baltic states and Saint Petersburg, then the capital of Imperial Russia.

Songkran Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"The Songkran Miracle\\" Plot: Our story begins with Ananda, an ambitious young Thai man working in the sleek skyscrapers of Manhattan as an investment banker. Despite his professional success, he holds a deep sense of emptiness and detachment from his cultural roots. Ananda hasn't been back to his homeland, Thailand, for a decade. Every year, during the Songkran festival, Thailand's grand New Year, he feels a poignant nostalgia for his culture, family, and traditions. On the other hand, there's Amara, Ananda's younger sister, who is all set to run their family restaurant in their quaint village by the Chao Praya river. She diligently prepares traditional Thai dishes her mother taught her, aiming to bring their small eatery on a global map during the Songkran festivities. One day, their grandmother, to whom Ananda is very close, falls seriously ill. Upon receiving this news, Ananda decides to return to Thailand. However, he's worried about leaving his high-stakes job during a critical financial deal. The setting shifts to the vibrant atmosphere of Thailand gearing up for Songkran. Ananda is plunged back into the world that he once knew deeply yet seems foreign after years in New York. He's visibly left in a cultural shock, struggling to adjust to the slower pace and ingrained traditions, including preparing for the Songkran festival. Amara, determined as ever, asks for Ananda's help with the restaurant and their community's Songkran festivities. These include water fights on streets, cleaning Buddha images, making merit at the temples, and preparing a traditional feast. Amidst all this, Ananda forgets his grandmother's illness temporarily but is continuously nagged by his job responsibilities. One day, during a sandcastle-making event – a Songkran tradition symbolizing the Buddhist belief in impermanence – Ananda marvels at Thailand's rich essence and feels a connection. He realizes he's missed this immensely – this sense of community, of oneness. His growing involvement in festival preparations and the vibrancy around rekindle his love for his heritage. He decides to help Amara make their restaurant a success. In the background, their grandmother's health worsens, heightening tensions between the family. Yet, she insists on the continuation of Songkran festivities, reminding Ananda and Amara about the importance of New Year, new beginnings, and the cleansing of their souls. Simultaneously, Ananda receives an ultimatum from his boss in New York who wants immediate results on their project. Ananda, torn between his high-flying career and rediscovered love for his homeland and its traditions, makes a heart-wrenching decision. During the climactic Songkran water fight - symbolizing the washing off of misfortunes from the past year- Ananda announces his decision. He resigns from his job in New York to support Amara and her dreams. The family is elated, and this joy brings a miraculous improvement in their grandmother's health. The movie ends with a heart-touching scene of the family celebrating Songkran, sprinkling water on their grandmother's hands, a Songkran tradition to pay respect. Ananda stands in the background, his heart filled with peace and fulfillment, as the camera pulls out to capture the bursting celebration of Songkran across the brightly lit Thai village. \\"The Songkran Miracle\\" serves as a moving tale about the power of roots, tradition, and family that can draw even the most lost souls back home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have a big equation here with lots of \\"w's\\", and we want to find out what \\"w\\" is equal to. Here's the equation: 181 * w = 360 * w + 548 * w - 40 * w First, we can add and subtract all the \\"w's\\" on the right side of the equation: 360 * w + 548 * w - 40 * w What we do here is just like if you have 360 apples, 548 apples, and you give away 40 apples. So it would be: 360 apples + 548 apples - 40 apples Now, if you have 360 + 548, that gives you 908 apples.

Since there are more \\"w's\\" on the right side, we can subtract 181 * w from both sides: 181 * w - 181 * w = 868 * w - 181 * w On the left side, since we took away all the 181 * w's, we now have 0: 0 = 868 * w - 181 * w Now, we do the subtraction on the right side, just like we did with the apples. If you have 868 apples and you give away 181 apples, you have: 868 - 181 = 687 apples So now our equation looks like: 0 = 687 * w Now, to find out what \\"w\\" is, we can divide by 687 on both sides: 0 / 687 = 687 * w / 687 0 = w So, little buddy, after all that work, we found that w is equal to 0!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Question: \\"Rats and primates have a lot in common, what is a characteristic that they share?\\" Context: \\"In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger relative to the rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Both rats and primates share the characteristic of having a larger cerebrum relative to the rest of their brain, which plays a role in their intelligence.

However, the compatibility of PS2 games with PS3 systems varies among different models of the PlayStation 3. Initial PlayStation 3 models, released in North America, Japan, and Asia, had both the PlayStation 2's CPU and GPU, allowing full backward compatibility with PlayStation 2 games via physical discs. This means that PS2 games could be played on these early PS3 models without any issue. Subsequent PlayStation 3 models contained only the PlayStation 2's GPU and not its CPU. This led to a reduced compatibility with PlayStation 2 games, as only a selection of PS2 games could be played on these systems. While the compatibility was not as extensive as the earlier models, it still allowed users to enjoy some of their favorite PlayStation 2 titles. Unfortunately, in later PlayStation 3 models, the PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility with physical discs was completely removed. This means that these particular PS3 systems cannot play any PlayStation 2 games via physical discs. However, some PlayStation 2 titles have been made available for purchase and download on the PlayStation Network, allowing users to play these games on their PS3 consoles. It is important to note that all PlayStation 3 models are capable of playing some PlayStation 1 games via physical discs.

School principal comes under fire in Indian school lunch deaths The scattered belongings of children who consumed a free midday meal are seen in Dharma Sati village in the Saran district of Bihar state. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) Investigators are still trying to determine what precisely happened at the school in India’s Bihar state, where tainted school lunches killed 23 children and sickened many more. But, as is so often the case with such tragedies, the politics are getting a few steps ahead of the forensics. Public attention is increasingly turning to the school’s principal, a woman named Meena Kumari. A local police chief said they were looking for Kumari and her husband but couldn’t find either of them, according to CNN. Some Indian media have described the principal and her husband as “absconding.” It’s important to note that, as many Indians have pointed out, this is the worst school lunch health incident but it is far from the first; the program seems to have flaws that extend well beyond this one school. Some are arguing that the real root of the problem goes to Indian governance itself. And investigators are still determining what actually happened in Bihar. So the scrutiny on Kumari does not necessarily mean that she is to blame, but, rightly or wrong, she is coming under growing public fire. On Wednesday, Bihar state education minister P. K. Shahi said something unusual in a news conference on the school deaths. He seemed to suggest, without much evidence, that the poisoning was somehow political. Shahi is a member of the Janata Dal (United) political party, which is popular in Bihar; he says that Kumari’s husband belongs to a rival party. “A surprising fact has come before us and that is the school principal’s husband is a member of a political party, and has a grocery shop,” Shahi said in the news conference. “The principal, Meena Kumari used to buy food material for the school lunch from his shop. The cook told me that she felt a little doubtful because the color of the oil looked different when she began to cook. The children also complained to the cook that the taste of the vegetables was not right. The cook did not understand and ate it herself. The result is in front of everybody. The children and the cook fell sick immediately.” Shahi, hinting at a political conspiracy, also suggested that the incident might be part of a plot to destabilize the government – again, without much evidence. Two cooks at the school, both of whom ate the meals and became sick, told the Associated Press that Kumari was in charge of determining what food would be served. Shahi has claimed that the cooks warned that the oil had been unsafe and were overruled by Kumari, but the cooks deny this. Many Indians have been so angered by the deaths that they’ve taken to the streets in protest, as this video shows: What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"In a school in India, some children had bad school lunches that made them very sick and some even died. People are trying to find out what happened, and they are looking at the school principal, Meena Kumari, for answers. Some people think she might be involved in a political plot. The principal bought the food from her husband's shop and a cook said the oil used looked different. Many people in India are angry about this and have been protesting on the streets.

If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . Now, I have a new situation: Mike is studying for his biology exam. He found that all body cells are not equal in size - some are large and some are small. He labeled the large cells as class A cells. Then he labeled the small cells as class B cells. He is now prepared to find the differences between them. Answer this question please: Which cell might not have microvilli as a feature, class A or class B? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, it seems that large cells, or class A cells, are more likely to have microvilli as a feature. This is because large cells face the challenge of having a smaller surface area to volume ratio, and they need to be able to transport nutrients and materials into or out of the cell efficiently to meet their metabolic needs. To overcome this challenge, large cells often develop cell protrusions, such as microvilli, which increase the surface area available for material transport. On the other hand, small cells, or class B cells, do not face the same challenges as large cells regarding surface area to volume ratio. Their smaller size allows for adequate nutrient and material transport without the need for additional cell protrusions such as microvilli. Therefore, class B cells (small cells) are less likely to have microvilli as a feature compared to class A cells (large cells)."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:The move was confirmed in a statement to the Stock Exchange on Monday. An extraordinary general meeting is being held at Ibrox on Friday, when the future of the current board is to be decided. It is unclear if chief executive Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach will also go before Friday. The Rangers Supporters Trust (RST) says it is \\"delighted\\" at Somers' resignation, describing him as \\"inept and embarrassing\\". It has also announced that it has been given the proxy vote for the shares owned by former Rangers manager Walter Smith and now claims to have voting rights for 6.3% of the shareholding. The EGM was called by shareholder Dave King, who has tabled resolutions aimed at ousting the current board and appointing himself, Paul Murray and John Gilligan in their place. Somers, 66, had been chairman since October but has faced numerous calls to step down by fans who have been protesting for change. He said in a statement: \\"I have worked in the City of London, the world's greatest financial centre for decades and enjoyed considerable success. \\"When I was approached about the chairmanship of Rangers, friends warned me that the world of football has different rules and codes of behaviour. \\"I now know that is a gross understatement. \\"I am a non-confrontational man and have always tried to bring harmony to boardrooms and with stakeholders. \\"At the risk of antagonising my army of critics, I would point out that Rangers managed to pay its bills and avoid going under during my tenure. \\"These critics might not agree with how we achieved this. \\"I look forward to alternative solutions from whoever is running the club in the future. \\"Despite the personal attacks on me from various sources, I genuinely wish the club the very best in the future and I am confident that with such a passionate and vociferous fan base they will be restored to their former glories.\\" Director James Easdale last week resigned from the board, giving his reason as a lack of support from the club's fans. In a damning statement, the RST said Somers' comments were \\"entirely in keeping with his behaviour\\" during his tenure. It said: \\"His lack of ambition or ability, rampant self interest, contempt for shareholders and fans, and disastrous dearth of understanding of the position of responsibility he held will be his legacy. \\"He will be remembered as one of the most inept and embarrassing chairmen of our wonderful sporting institution.\\" And the fans' group has called for the remaining directors, Llambias and Leach, to \\"follow Mr Somers out of the door\\". \\"Mr Leach should have resigned when he made disparaging comments about major shareholders in a meeting with fans,\\" said the RST statement. \\"This amounted to gross misconduct in our opinion and in any normally operating business he would no longer be in position. He should be suspended and subject to disciplinary procedures after the general meeting. \\"Mr Llambias has serious questions to answer over the recruitment process which saw him appointed as chief executive. Not least whether the inaccurate information which appeared in his bio on the Rangers website, and was circulated to shareholders, formed part of the information relied on to support his application. \\"His ham-fisted attempt to use legal threats to silence legitimate criticism from the outgoing Fan Board has further alienated supporters. Taken together we believe these make his position untenable. He should also be suspended and subject to disciplinary procedures after the general meeting.\\" On the subject of Smith passing his voting right to the RST, a spokesman said: \\"Obviously we are delighted that Walter has agreed to proxy his shares to us. \\"We are sure he shares our hope that things are about to change for the better.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"This is about a man named Somers who was the chairman of a football club called Rangers.

Based on this, the answer would be [i] no. To answer both questions in detail: Why there is a requirement of fees in NIT: National Institutes of Technology (NITs) are premier autonomous public institutions in India primarily focused on providing undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in various engineering and technology disciplines. These institutes require fees to be paid by the students for a variety of reasons: 1. Operational Expenses: The fees collected by NITs are used to cover the daily operational expenses of the institution. This includes salaries for faculty and staff, maintenance of buildings and infrastructure, utility bills, and other essential services that enable the smooth functioning of the institute. 2. Infrastructure Development: A significant portion of the fees collected is invested in the growth and development of the NIT's infrastructure, such as building new classrooms, labs, hostels, and other facilities. The expansion of infrastructure helps accommodate a larger number of students, allowing the institute to offer quality education to a broader demographic. 3. Quality of Education: The fees collected are used to ensure the quality of education provided in NITs. This includes funding for faculty development programs, research projects, state-of-the-art equipment and resources, and ensuring students have access to up-to-date course materials and learning tools. 4. Scholarships and Financial Aid: A part of the fees collected is also allocated for scholarships and financial aid for economically disadvantaged students. This ensures that quality education remains accessible to students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. 5. Extracurricular Activities and Student Services: The fees collected help fund various extracurricular activities and student services such as sports facilities, cultural clubs, career counseling, and other student-oriented initiatives. These services ultimately contribute to the holistic development of students during their tenure at the NITs. What is fees in NITs: Fees in NITs typically refer to the amount of money that students are required to pay to attend and participate in the academic and extracurricular activities offered by the National Institutes of Technology. Fee structures in NITs often include components such as: 1. Tuition Fee: This is the primary fee that covers the cost of the educational services provided by the institute. Tuition fees in NITs vary depending on the specific program and course of study. 2. Hostel Fee: As many students at NITs live on campus, they are required to pay a hostel fee which covers the cost of accommodations, including room and board, as well as other facilities provided within the hostel premises. 3. Mess Fee: A mess fee is charged to cover the cost of food provided to students staying in the hostels. This fee typically includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals throughout the semester. 4. Caution Deposit: Many NITs require students to pay a caution deposit, a refundable amount that serves as a security against any damage or loss to institute property. 5. Additional Fees: There may be other additional fees associated with specific programs, courses, or student services. These fees may cover expenses such as lab fees, examination fees, library fees, and other miscellaneous charges. The exact fee structure and amount may vary across different NITs and may also be subject to revisions or updates from time to time. Students and their families can refer to the official website of the respective NIT to obtain detailed fee information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Does the sentence \\"The Federal Council constitutes the federal government, directs the federal administration and serves as collective Head of State.\\" answer the question \\"What serves as the collective Head of State?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"The Federal Council constitutes the federal government, directs the federal administration and serves as collective Head of State.\\" provides a clear answer to the question \\"What serves as the collective Head of State?\\". In this context, the Federal Council serves as the collective Head of State. To provide more information, the Federal Council is a unique form of government body in countries that employ a federal system. This body typically consists of several members representing different regions or entities within the federal system. The Federal Council is responsible for major decision-making, policy-making, and administration at the federal level. In some countries, the Federal Council assumes the role of collective Head of State. This means that rather than having a single figure, such as a president or monarch, as the highest representative of the country, the Federal Council collectively fulfills these duties. The concept of a collective Head of State can be seen as a means to decentralize power and ensure that no single individual wields too much authority, considering that important decisions lay in the hands of a group of representatives from different regions or entities. With such a system, decisions tend to be more balanced, reflecting the diverse views and interests of the represented parties. Moreover, the Federal Council's other functions such as directing the federal administration and constituting the federal government implies that this body plays an essential role in the governance and management of the country. By overseeing the administration and crafting policies, it can influence various aspects of the nation, from economic development to social and environmental issues. Overall, the sentence in question effectively answers the given query by identifying the Federal Council as the collective Head of State. By doing so, it also conveys the idea that this body serves as a crucial component of the federal government, managing both governance and administrative responsibilities at the highest level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"To answer both questions, let's examine them separately first. Task 1: Identify the type of fuel generally used in rocket engines. Step 1: Research common fuels used in rocket engines There are several types of fuels used in rocket engines, including liquid hydrogen, kerosene, and solid fuels like ammonium perchlorate composite propellant. However, liquid fuels such as hydrogen and kerosene are more common in modern rocket engines. Liquid hydrogen is often used due to its high energy content and low molecular weight, while kerosene is popular for its high density and relatively low cost. Task 2: Explain the use of oxidizer in rocket engines. Step 1: Define an oxidizer An oxidizer is a substance that provides oxygen to support combustion. Since there is no oxygen in space to support combustion, an oxidizer must be carried along with the fuel in a rocket engine. Step 2: Describe the role of oxidizers in rocket engines In a rocket engine, the oxidizer reacts with the fuel to produce high-temperature and high-pressure gases. These gases are then accelerated through a nozzle, generating thrust that propels the rocket. Common oxidizers include liquid oxygen, nitrogen tetroxide, and dinitrogen tetroxide. Task 3: Determine if the questions are the same The first question asks about the type of fuel generally used in rocket engines. The second question asks about the use of oxidizers in rocket engines. While both questions are related to rocket engines, they ask about different components and their functions. Therefore, the questions are not the same.

But the size of the added risk has not been clear. Now, a new study offers a way to estimate the risk. It finds that for most women the risk is modest, and that it is outweighed by the benefit from the treatment, which can halve the recurrence rate and lower the death rate from breast cancer by about one-sixth. According to the study, a 50-year-old woman with no cardiovascular risk factors has a 1.9 percent chance of dying of heart disease before she turns 80. Radiation treatment for breast cancer would increase that risk to between 2.4 percent and 3.4 percent, depending on how much radiation hits the heart. “It would be a real tragedy if this put women off having radiotherapy for breast cancer,” said Sarah Darby, a professor of medical statistics at the University of Oxford in Britain, and the lead author of the study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Silvia Formenti, the chairwoman of radiation oncology at New York University Langone Medical Center, said she worried that women with cancer would misconstrue the findings to mean that radiation is dangerous and that they should have their breasts removed instead of having lumpectomies, in order to avoid radiation. “There is a wave toward mastectomy in this country,” Dr. Formenti said. But at the same time, she and other experts say that the cardiovascular risk is real and that when radiation is given, every effort should be made to minimize exposure of the heart. In addition, women who have had radiation treatment need to be especially vigilant about controlling other factors that increase the odds of heart disease, like high blood pressure and cholesterol. Dr. Lori Mosca, the director of preventive cardiology at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, who was not involved in the study, said the findings meant that a history of breast irradiation should be added to the list of risk factors for heart disease and taken into consideration by all doctors who are treating such patients. “We absolutely need to put on our radar screen that prior radiation to the breast may be a new and important risk factor for women,” Dr. Mosca said. But she and other experts also warned that the results needed to be verified because the study was not a controlled experiment, but was based on an analysis of records and estimates of radiation exposure to the heart. Dr. Javid Moslehi, co-director of the cardio-oncology program at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and the author of an editorial accompanying the study, said the research was the first to provide risk estimates correlated with doses in breast cancer treatment, over a long time period. “This is a huge paper, both in terms of how many women it impacts, and how it opens the door for new studies that need to be done,” Dr. Moslehi said. He said the study reflected the fact that many people with cancer are now living long enough to encounter long-term effects of both radiation and chemotherapy. They have given rise to a new and fast-growing field in medicine, cardio-oncology. About three million women in the United States have been treated for breast cancer, and the majority have had radiation. Although doctors try to spare the heart, it still gets some of the dose, especially when the left breast is treated. Radiation can damage the linings of blood vessels and scar the heart muscle. Dr. Darby’s study is based on the records of 2,168 women who had radiation for breast cancer from 1958 to 2001 in Sweden and Denmark; 963 of the women had “major cardiac events” sometime after their cancer treatment, meaning a heart attack or clogged coronary arteries that needed treatment or caused death. From the treatment records, the researchers estimated the radiation dose to the women’s hearts. They found that the risk began to increase within a few years after exposure, and that it continued for at least 20 years. The higher the dose, the higher the risk, and there was some increase in risk at even the lowest level of exposure. “It was certainly a surprise to us that the risk started within the first few years after exposure, as radiation-related heart disease has traditionally been thought of as usually occurring several decades after exposure,” Dr. Darby said. Radiation is measured in units called Grays, and the researchers found that for each Gray to which the heart was exposed, the odds of heart attack or another coronary events rose by 7.4 percent. The average dose to the heart over an entire course of radiation treatment was 5 Gray, they said. For an individual woman, the net effect would depend on her baseline initial risk of heart disease and the total radiation dose to her heart. Women who already had risk factors, especially those who had had heart attacks in the past, would have seen the largest absolute risk from radiation. Some radiation oncologists say that nowadays, the dose to the heart is lower than 5 Gray. Dr. Louis S. Constine, vice chairman of radiation oncology at the University of Rochester Medical Center, said that 2 Gray was more common and that doctors could now put shields in front of the heart and “curve radiation around the chest wall instead of shooting it through the heart and lungs.” Dr. Formenti thinks that for most patients, the best way to protect the heart is to treat them while they are lying on their stomachs, instead of the usual way, lying on their backs. Women lie on a table or a mattress with openings that let the breasts drop away from the chest. Anatomy differs, but in most women this prone position helps keep the radiation beams as far as possible from the heart and lungs. The heart still receives some radiation, but significantly less than when women lie on their backs, especially when the left breast is being treated. “If you can keep it below 1 Gray, which is what we are doing, you are probably O.K. with the majority of patients,” Dr. Formenti said. During the past 15 years, she said, she has treated several thousand patients this way. Dr. Formenti and her colleagues also teach the technique to other doctors. But, she said, it is taking a long time to catch on. ||||| Radiotherapy regimens for breast cancer have changed since the women in these trials were irradiated, and the doses of radiation to which the heart is exposed are now generally lower. 4 Nevertheless, in most women, the heart still receives doses of 1 to 5 Gy. 5-11 Several studies have suggested that exposures at this level can cause ischemic heart disease, 12-14 but the magnitude of the risk after any given dose to the heart is uncertain, as are the time to the development of any radiation-related disease and the influence of other cardiac risk factors. We therefore conducted a study relating the risk of ischemic heart disease after radiotherapy to each woman's radiation dose to the heart and to any cardiac risk factors she had at the time of radiotherapy. Randomized trials have shown that radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer can reduce the rates of recurrence and of death from breast cancer. 1,2 However, long-term follow-up in some trials has shown that radiotherapy can also increase the risk of ischemic heart disease, presumably through incidental irradiation of the heart. 1,3 Rate ratios were estimated with the use of conditional logistic regression after stratification according to country and to age at the time of cancer diagnosis, year of cancer diagnosis, and years from cancer diagnosis to first subsequent major coronary event (for case patients) or the index date (for controls) (all in 5-year categories). 22,23 To estimate the proportional increase in the rate of major coronary events per gray of radiation, the data were also stratified according to presence or absence of a cardiac risk factor. The rate of major coronary events was modeled as B s (1+KX), where B s was the stratum-specific rate of major coronary events in the absence of radiotherapy, X was the dose (or EQD2) of cardiac radiation (in Gy), and K was the percentage increase in the rate of major coronary events per gray. The form 1+KX was chosen for the dose–response relationship because a wide variety of functions are approximately linear for small values of X. The adequacy of 1+KX for summarizing the dose–response relationship was examined by carrying out analyses based on categories of radiation dose. In these analyses and in tests for interactions between radiation dose and other factors, models similar to the model described above were used. Significance tests were two-sided, and both significance tests and confidence intervals were based on the likelihood ratio. For analyses in which the explanatory variable was categorical, the confidence intervals for every category, including the reference category, were estimated from the amount of information in that category. 24 Calculations were performed with the use of Stata Statistical Software, release 12 (StataCorp), 25 and EpiWin, release 1.8 (Hirosoft International). 26 Individual radiotherapy charts, including a diagram or photograph of the treatment fields and a dose plan (where available) were copied. Virtual simulation and planning based on computed tomography (CT) (or, for a few regimens, manual planning) were used to reconstruct each radiotherapy regimen on the CT scan of a woman with typical anatomy. Virtual simulation and CT planning involved the reconstruction of radiotherapy fields on a CT scan. Radiation doses to the structures of interest were then estimated with the use of the treatment-planning system Helax–TMS, version 6.1B (Nucletron). In manual planning, the doses were estimated on the basis of charts on which isodose curves (i.e., lines delimiting areas receiving the same radiation dose) had been drawn. As previously described, 18,19 dose-volume histograms for the whole heart and for the left anterior descending coronary artery (which often receives the highest dose of radiation from radiotherapy for cancer of the left breast) were obtained for the regimens used, and the mean doses received by these two structures were calculated. Equivalent doses delivered in 2-Gy fractions (EQD2) 20 were calculated from the dose-volume histograms as nd[(d+α/β)÷(2+α/β)], where n was the number of fractions, d was the dose to the heart per fraction (in Gy), and α/β was 2 Gy. 21 In both countries, women without histopathological confirmation of breast cancer, with bilateral or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, or with a history of cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) or previous radiotherapy to the thoracic area were excluded. All other women who received radiotherapy were cross-matched with nationwide registers of diagnosis at the time of hospital discharge and cause of death (up to 2002 in Sweden and 2007 in Denmark). 17 Women whose primary diagnosis was a major coronary event that occurred after a diagnosis of breast cancer but before any recurrence or diagnosis of a second cancer were classified as case patients. Whenever possible, hospital cardiology or autopsy records were reviewed, and if the case-defining event was refuted, the woman was excluded from the study. For each remaining case patient, we defined “time period” as the time from breast-cancer diagnosis to the time of first major coronary event. Controls (one per case patient in Sweden and two per case patient in Denmark) were selected at random from all eligible women in the study population. Eligibility criteria for controls included fulfillment of the matching criteria (country of residence, age at the time of breast-cancer diagnosis, and year of diagnosis, with both age and year matched within 5 years); receipt of radiotherapy; and no recurrence of breast cancer, no diagnosis with another cancer, and no major coronary event before the index date (defined as the date of breast-cancer diagnosis plus the time period of the matched case). A single study protocol was used, but the selection of case patients and controls varied slightly between the two countries. In Sweden, all women living in Stockholm for whom data were recorded in the Swedish National Cancer Register 15 were considered for the study if they received a diagnosis of breast cancer between 1958 and 2001, were younger than 70 years of age at the time of diagnosis, and had received radiotherapy. Because information on radiotherapy is not kept by the Swedish Register, hospital records were used to determine which women had received radiotherapy. In Denmark, all women for whom data were recorded in the register held by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 16 were considered for the study if they received the diagnosis of breast cancer between 1977 and 2000, were younger than 75 years at the time of diagnosis, and received radiotherapy. The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency and by the ethics review board of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm. The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the nature of the study. A population-based case–control study of major coronary events was conducted in women in Sweden and Denmark who received external-beam radiotherapy for invasive breast cancer. Major coronary events were defined as a diagnosis of myocardial infarction (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] codes I21–I24), coronary revascularization, or death from ischemic heart disease (ICD-10 codes I20–I25). Patients with a diagnosis of angina alone were not included, because pilot studies showed that we could not reliably identify angina. Patient records from hospital oncology departments were used to obtain data on each woman's medical history before her diagnosis of breast cancer, tumor characteristics, and radiotherapy. The overall average of the mean EQD2 doses to the heart was 3.9 Gy (range, 0.1 to 30.4). The mean doses and the EQD2 doses to the heart were highly correlated (correlation coefficient, 0.98). The results of analyses based on dose and EQD2 dose were therefore similar (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Estimated mean doses to the left anterior descending coronary artery and to the heart were also correlated (correlation coefficient, 0.76) (Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix ). The mean dose of radiation to the heart was a better predictor of the rate of major coronary events than the mean dose to the left anterior descending coronary artery (P<0.001 for mean dose to the heart; P=0.001 for mean dose to the left anterior descending coronary artery). The mean dose of radiation to the heart remained significantly associated with the rate of major coronary events after the mean dose to the left anterior descending coronary artery was taken into account (P=0.04). However, the converse did not apply: the mean dose to the left anterior descending coronary artery was not significantly associated with the rate of major coronary events after the mean dose to the heart was taken into account (P=0.62). The percentage increases in the rate of major coronary events per gray of radiation according to the number of years since radiation exposure were as follows: 0 to 4 years, 16.3% (95% CI, 3.0 to 64.3); 5 to 9 years, 15.5% (95% CI, 2.5 to 63.3); 10 to 19 years, 1.2% (95% CI, −2.2 to 8.5); and 20 or more years, 8.2% (95% CI, 0.4 to 26.6) ( Table 3 Table 3 Percentage Increase in the Rate of Major Coronary Events per Gray, According to Time since Radiotherapy.). The variation among these values was consistent with random variation (P=0.16 for heterogeneity; P=0.26 for trend). Findings were similar when the analysis was repeated separately according to age at the time of the breast-cancer diagnosis, the presence or absence of preexisting cardiac risk factors, whether the case patient had died from ischemic heart disease, and whether the case patient's hospital cardiology record or autopsy record had been reviewed (Tables S5 through S8 in the Supplementary Appendix ). The overall average of the estimated mean doses of radiation to the heart was 6.6 Gy for women with tumors in the left breast, 2.9 Gy for those with tumors in the right breast, and 4.9 Gy overall (range, 0.03 to 27.72). The rate of major coronary events increased by 7.4% for each increase of 1 Gy in the mean radiation dose delivered to the heart (95% CI, 2.9 to 14.5; P<0.001) ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Rate of Major Coronary Events According to Mean Radiation Dose to the Heart, as Compared with the Estimated Rate with No Radiation Exposure to the Heart.). When women were grouped according to whether the mean radiation dose to the heart was less than 2 Gy, 2 to 4 Gy, 5 to 9 Gy, or 10 or more Gy, the percentage increases in the rate of major coronary events in these four categories, as compared with the estimated rate if the cardiac dose had been zero, were 10% (95% CI, −9 to 33), 30% (95% CI, 14 to 49), 40% (95% CI, 15 to 72), and 116% (95% CI, 59 to 195), respectively. The percentage increase per gray did not differ significantly according to any of the matching factors used in the selection of controls, tumor characteristics (including whether the tumor was in the left or right breast), or cancer treatments in addition to radiotherapy. Despite the fact that the rate of major coronary events was higher among women with cardiac risk factors than among those without such risk factors, the percentage increase in the rate of major coronary events per gray was similar for women with and those without a cardiac risk factor at the time of breast-cancer diagnosis ( Table 2 Table 2 Radiation Dose to the Heart and Percentage Increase in the Rate of Major Coronary Events per Gray, According to Risk Factors and Other Characteristics.). Women irradiated for cancer of the left breast had higher rates of major coronary events than women irradiated for cancer of the right breast (P=0.002), but there were no other strong associations between the rate of major coronary events and tumor characteristics or the cancer treatments administered in addition to radiotherapy (rate ratio, 1.20; P=0.06 for nodal status and P≥0.10 for all other tumor or treatment characteristics) ( Table 1 Table 1 Characteristics of the Women in the Study at the Time of Breast-Cancer Diagnosis and Association between the Characteristics and the Subsequent Rate of Major Coronary Events.). In contrast, the overall rate ratio for a major coronary event among women with a history of ischemic heart disease as compared with women with no such history was 6.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.37 to 10.18). The rate ratio was 13.43 (95% CI, 7.65 to 23.58) during the first 10 years after the cancer diagnosis as compared with 2.09 (95% CI, 1.05 to 4.13) during later years (P<0.001) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Rates of major coronary events were also elevated among women with a history of other circulatory diseases, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; among women who smoked; and among women with a high body-mass index or a history of regular analgesic use. The rate ratio for the presence of one or more of these factors but no ischemic heart disease was 1.96 overall (95% CI, 1.60 to 2.40); during the first 10 years after the cancer diagnosis, the rate ratio was 2.60 (95% CI, 1.89 to 3.57) as compared with 1.63 (95% CI, 1.24 to 2.15) during later years (P=0.03). A total of 963 women with major coronary events and 1205 controls were included in the study. Among the case-defining major coronary events (i.e., the event resulting in inclusion in the study), 44% occurred less than 10 years after breast cancer was diagnosed, 33% occurred 10 to 19 years afterward, and 23% occurred 20 or more years afterward. Hospital cardiology or autopsy records confirmed the case-defining major coronary event in 65% of case patients and were consistent with the event in 9% of case patients; for the remaining 26% of case patients, no relevant record could be found. A total of 54% of case patients were known to have died from ischemic heart disease, either at the time of their case-defining event or subsequently. (For further information, see Tables S1, S2, and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.) Discussion Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with more than 1 million new diagnoses each year.27 Moreover, every year, tens of thousands of women worldwide receive a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ. The overall 5-year survival rate for these two diagnostic groups combined is approximately 90%, and in both groups many of the survivors will have received radiotherapy.28 Current mean doses of radiation to the heart from radiotherapy for breast cancer are typically about 1 or 2 Gy for disease of the right breast. For disease of the left breast, the doses are usually higher but vary widely, and for some women, including those in whom the distance of the heart to the thoracic wall is small and those who require internal mammary irradiation, the mean dose may be around 10 Gy.5-11 Among the 2168 women in this study, the mean dose to the heart ranged from 0.03 Gy to 27.72 Gy, with an overall average of the mean doses of 4.9 Gy. The risk of a major coronary event increased linearly with the mean dose to the heart. The magnitude of the risk was 7.4% per gray, with no apparent threshold below which there was no risk. The risk started to increase within the first 5 years after exposure and continued for at least 20 years. The percentage increase in risk per gray was similar for women with and those without cardiac risk factors at the time of radiotherapy. A strength of this study is that it relates the risk of ischemic heart disease among women who have received radiotherapy for breast cancer to individual doses of cardiac radiation and individual cardiac risk factors at the time of their cancer diagnosis. Other strengths of the study are that it was carried out in women with cancer that had not recurred (thus avoiding confusion with the influence of further treatment); that it was population-based, including all women recorded as receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer in Denmark or Stockholm during the period of interest (thus avoiding the tendency in randomized trials to omit patients in poor health); and that the majority of cardiac events were confirmed by a review of cardiology or autopsy records. Because health status may play a role in the selection of women for radiotherapy, we included in the study only women who had received radiotherapy; nonrandomized comparisons of women who underwent irradiation with those who did not could produce misleading estimates of risk.29 A limitation of our study was that individual CT-based information on radiotherapy was unavailable for the women studied, because they were treated before the era of three-dimensional CT-based planning. However, we have used 20 consecutive individual CT-based, three-dimensional planning scans to show that for left and right tangential radiotherapy and for left and right direct internal mammary fields, the patient-to-patient variation in mean radiation dose to the heart is small (coefficients of variation, 30%, 11%, 11%, and 21%, respectively).4 We have also confirmed that the patient with typical anatomy who was used to calculate the dose estimates in this study was average in terms of the radiation dose to her heart. Consideration of irradiated structures within the heart30,31 may prove fruitful in the future, but in the present study, inclusion of the estimated mean dose to the left anterior descending coronary artery did not improve prediction of the rate of major coronary events. Since our study included few women who were younger than 40 years of age at the time of radiotherapy, caution is needed in applying our results to women in this age group, and the possibility of larger increases in the rate of major coronary events per gray of radiation for this group cannot be ruled out. Few women in this study were treated with anthracyclines, and none with taxanes or trastuzumab, all of which are known to affect the heart, even in the absence of radiotherapy.32 Studies comparing rates of cardiac disease among women who received radiotherapy for cancer of the left breast and women who received radiotherapy for cancer of the right breast have been reviewed elsewhere.33-35 Such studies are likely to underestimate the extent of any radiation-related risk because they rely on any difference in cardiac dose between women irradiated for tumors in the left breast and those irradiated for tumors in the right breast. In addition, these studies have generally not had information on whether a woman had prior heart disease, and thus could not account for any tendency to avoid irradiation in women with preexisting cardiac risk factors and cancer of the left breast or for the exclusion of women whose only diagnosis was angina (which may be unreliably recorded in routine records). In our study, the radiation-related increase in the risk of major coronary events began within the first 5 years after exposure. Early increases in risk have been reported in studies of patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma who received radiotherapy.36-38 The effect of preexisting cardiac risk factors on the risk of radiation-related ischemic heart disease has not been well studied, but one report on patients with breast cancer indicated that the absolute effect of radiotherapy was greater in smokers than in nonsmokers.39 Several studies have empirically investigated the relationship between cardiac radiation dose and risk of heart disease (Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). The estimates vary considerably, but this is to be expected, since both the populations studied and the end points reported were diverse. The relevance of our findings to a woman receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer today is that they make it possible to estimate her absolute risk of radiation-related ischemic heart disease. This absolute risk can be weighed against the probable absolute reduction in her risk of recurrence or death from breast cancer that would be achieved with radiotherapy.2 The percentage increases in risk per unit increase in the mean dose of radiation to the heart are similar for women with and women without preexisting cardiac risk factors. Therefore, absolute radiation-related risks are greater for women with preexisting cardiac risk factors than for other women. Data from a case–control study do not by themselves permit estimation of absolute risks. Therefore, we have illustrated our results on the risk of fatal ischemic heart disease by combining them with recent data on rates of death from ischemic heart disease for the 15 westernmost countries of the European Union combined (Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix). We have also illustrated the effect of radiotherapy for breast cancer on the risk of an acute coronary event (i.e., a major coronary event or unstable angina) by assuming that for women younger than 50 years of age, those 50 to 59 years of age, those 60 to 69 years of age, and those 70 to 79 years of age, the rates of acute coronary events are 6 times, 5 times, 3 times, and 2 times the rates of death from ischemic heart disease, respectively.40 The resulting baseline lifetime risk estimates are similar to recent estimates for the United States.41 For a 50-year-old woman with no preexisting cardiac risk factors, radiotherapy involving a mean dose to the heart of 3 Gy would increase her risk of death from ischemic heart disease before the age of 80 years from 1.9% to 2.4% (i.e., an absolute increase of about 0.5 percentage points), and it would increase her risk of having at least one acute coronary event from 4.5% to 5.4% (i.e., an absolute increase of about 0.9 percentage points) (Figure 2Figure 2 Cumulative Risks of Death from Ischemic Heart Disease and of at Least One Acute Coronary Event.). If her mean cardiac dose were 10 Gy, her absolute risk of death from ischemic heart disease would increase from 1.9% to 3.4% (1.5 percentage points), and her absolute risk of having at least one acute coronary event would increase from 4.5% to 7.7% (3.2 percentage points). For women with one or more preexisting cardiac risk factors, both the baseline risks and the absolute increases in risk are higher. For example, radiotherapy involving a mean dose of radiation to the heart of 3 Gy in a 50-year-old woman with one or more cardiac risk factors would increase her risk of death from ischemic heart disease before the age of 80 years from 3.4% to 4.1% (an absolute increase of 0.7 percentage points), and it would increase her absolute risk of having an acute coronary event by the age of 80 years by 1.7 percentage points. A mean dose of 10 Gy to her heart would result in radiation-related risks that were considerably higher. In conclusion, we found that incidental exposure of the heart to radiotherapy for breast cancer increased the rate of major coronary events by 7.4% per gray, with no apparent threshold. The percentage increase per unit increase in the mean dose of radiation to the heart was similar for women with and women without preexisting cardiac risk factors, which indicates that the absolute increases in risk for a given dose to the heart were larger for women with preexisting cardiac risk factors. Therefore, clinicians may wish to consider cardiac dose and cardiac risk factors as well as tumor control when making decisions about the use of radiotherapy for breast cancer. ||||| Radiation, a component of breast cancer therapy, can penetrate to the heart, a new study finds. A linear accelerator is used to treat cancer at a hospital. Women treated with radiation for breast cancer are more likely to develop heart problems later, even with the lower doses used today, new research suggests. (Photo: John Rucosky, AP) Story Highlights Radiation can keep breast cancer from returning, but also damage the heart Breast cancer survivors face a number of long-term complications due to treatment Chemotherapy can cause heart failure and can put women into early menopause Women treated with radiation for breast cancer face an increased risk of heart attacks and death, even 20 years after the end of treatment, a new study shows. The study is the latest to document the serious long-term health problems faced by cancer survivors. Although improved treatments allow more people today to survive their disease, these toxic therapies also lead many to suffer chronic health problems. Radiation, for example, is a key component of breast cancer therapy and significantly reduces the risk that tumors will return. But beams of radiation can penetrate beyond the breast to the heart and the arteries that feed it, according to a study published online Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. In a study of 2,168 breast cancer patients who had radiation therapy between 1958 and 2001 in Sweden and Denmark, doctors found that any amount of radiation increased the risk of heart disease. Researchers defined heart disease to include heart attacks, surgeries such as a bypass or angioplasty, or a heart-related death. \\"This is a major concern,\\" says Ben Smith, an assistant professor of radiation oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the new study. In spite of improvements in technology, Smith says many women around the country \\"still have a significant portion of their heart in the path of the radiation beam.\\" STORY: DNA from tumor could provide early warning More than 232,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, according to the American Cancer Society. About 3 million American women today are survivors. Women who received radiation to the left breast, which is slightly closer to the heart, were at especially high risk, the study says. Women with pre-existing heart disease also had a higher risk. Heart problems were generally most common in the first five to 10 years after treatment. Over the course of 20 years, the risk of heart disease increased an average of 7.4% with each additional unit of radiation, called a gray. Women in the study received an average radiation dose of 4.9 gray to the heart, although some women received up to 27 gray. Doctors have worked to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure over the years, experts note. But American women being treated today may still receive radiation of about 2 to 5 gray to the heart, Smith says. New technology allows doctors at his hospital to reduce that exposure even further, to a fraction of 1 gray. Yet the risks described in the new paper \\"may represent just the tip of the iceberg,\\" wrote Javid Moslehi, a cardiologist specializing in the care of cancer patients at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. That's because radiation can cause not just narrowing of the arteries and heart attacks, but abnormal heart rhythms, malfunctioning heart valves and other serious issues, which weren't measured in this study, Moslehi writes. Certain chemotherapy drugs also can cause heart failure, he writes. In the new study, only eight patients got chemo. Lastly, chemo often throws women into early menopause, which causes many breast cancer survivors to gain weight, says Jody Schoger, a breast cancer survivor and advocate from The Woodlands, Texas. That puts further stress on the heart. Because cancer treatment can damage the heart and blood vessels in so many ways, leading a healthy lifestyle — with a good diet, lots of exercise and no smoking — is critically important, Smith says. Cardiologists and family doctors also can help women manage their risks, says cardiologist Christopher Cannon, a professor at Harvard Medical School. Breast cancer survivors could be screened early, for example. Doctors have a wide variety of medications, from aspirin to statins, that also can reduce women's risks, he says. Eric Winer, director of breast medical oncology at Dana-Farber, says patients should not avoid potentially lifesaving radiation therapy because of the risk of heart disease. \\"Radiation is remarkably safe and well-tolerated,\\" Winer says. \\"It would be a mistake to conclude from this that we should use radiation less often.\\" But doctors agree that scientists should continue to look for ways to reduce women's risks. At M.D. Anderson, women can now receive radiation therapy that is synchronized with their breath, Smith says. Inhaling deeply pushes the heart down, and out of the radiation beam. New technology starts and stops the radiation beam automatically as women breathe in and out, nearly eliminating exposure to the heart, he says. Radiation's risks to the heart loom especially large when women have very early cancers that may not prove life-threatening, Smith says. About 60,000 women a year are diagnosed with a condition called DCIS, or ductal carcinoma in situe. Experts disagree on whether these \\"Stage O\\" tumors represent very early cancers or pre-cancers. About 30% to 40% of DCIS progresses into invasive cancer, although not all of those tumors are life-threatening, Winer says. Because of that uncertainly, women with DCIS are typically treated as if they have an early cancer, with a lumpectomy, radiation and sometimes hormone therapy. While radiation reduces the risk that women will be diagnosed with a new case of DCIS or cancer, there's no evidence to show it improves survival, Winer says. \\"Any concerns about radiation become an even bigger issue for women who have very early stage breast cancers like DCIS, where women have to very carefully weight the pros and cons of treatments,\\" Winer says. \\"We need to figure out which women with DCIS need treatment to spare women from the side effects.\\" Smith encourages breast cancer patients to talk to their doctors about taking steps to reduce their risks. \\"Some practices do amazing work to essentially spare the heart,\\" says Smith, who serves as a consultant to review radiation plans from doctors around the country. \\"And there are others that pretend the heart isn't even there. This is a teachable moment for doctors.\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/XIKhoZ ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A new study has found that radiation treatment for breast cancer can increase a woman's risk of heart disease, although the size of the added risk has not been clear. However, the study also states that for most women the risk is modest and it is outweighed by the benefit from the treatment. It is important to note that the results of the study need to be verified as it was based on an analysis of records and estimates of radiation exposure to the heart, and not a controlled experiment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Soccer is a fun game where two teams try to kick a ball into a goal to score points. It's like a big game of tag, but with your feet! In soccer, there is a special player called the \\"goalkeeper\\" or \\"goalie\\". The goalie's job is to stop the other team's ball from going into their goal. Do you want to learn how to be a great goalkeeper? Let's get started with the basic rules of soccer and the rules of being a goalie! ⚽ Basic Rules of Soccer: 1. There are two teams, each with 11 players. 2. The team that scores the most goals wins. 3. You can use your feet, legs, chest, and head to touch the ball, but you cannot use your hands or arms. 4. Only the goalkeeper can touch the ball with his or her hands, but only inside the special area called the \\"penalty box\\" or \\"goal box\\". 5. If a player touches the ball with their hands or arms on purpose, it is called a \\"handball\\", and the other team gets a free kick or a penalty kick. 🥅 Rules of Being a Goalie: 1. The goalie must wear something to cover their hands (called goalkeeper gloves) to protect them when catching or punching the ball. 2. The goalie must stay inside their penalty box to use their hands. 3. If the goalie catches the ball, they can hold onto it for up to six seconds before they must throw or kick it back into play. 4. The goalie cannot touch the ball with their hands if a teammate has kicked the ball to them on purpose. This is called a \\"back-pass\\". 5. The goalie can use any part of their body (including their hands) to stop the ball from going into the goal. 🧤 Goalkeeper Equipment: 1. Goalkeeper gloves: To protect your hands and grip the ball better. 2. Goalkeeper jersey: A long sleeve shirt, usually with padding on the elbows. 3. Goalkeeper shorts: To match your team's uniform. 4. Shin guards: To protect your legs from getting hurt. 5. Soccer socks: Long socks to hold your shin guards in place. 6. Soccer cleats: Special soccer shoes to help you run and kick better on the grass. 🏟️ Where and How a Goalie May Play the Soccer Ball: 1. Inside the penalty box, goalies can use their hands. 2. Goalies can kick the ball from the ground or from their hands. This is called a \\"goal kick\\". 3. Goalies can also throw or roll the ball to their teammates. 4. Remember, goalies can't touch the ball with their hands if a teammate kicks it to them on purpose. 5. Outside the penalty box, goalies play just like other players and cannot use their hands. 🌍 Rules Specific to Your Country or Organization: Soccer is played all around the world, and sometimes there are small differences in the rules depending on where you play. Don't worry! Just ask your coach or a grown-up who knows about soccer, and they can help you learn the special rules for where you live. Now you know the basics of soccer, the rules of being a goalie, and all about goalkeeper equipment. You're ready to play soccer and become an awesome goalie! Remember to always have fun and practice, and one day, you could be a famous goalkeeper like Hope Solo or Manuel Neuer! Good luck on your soccer adventure! ⚽"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To date, these agents have been highly safe in patients but have generally fallen short of their expected therapeutic value as monotherapies. Consequently, new approaches to generating highly potent oncolytic viruses are needed. To address this need, we developed a new method that we term \\"Directed Evolution\\" for creating highly potent oncolytic viruses.', 'Taking the \\"Directed Evolution\\" approach, viral diversity was increased by pooling an array of serotypes, then passaging the pools under conditions that invite recombination between serotypes. These highly diverse viral pools were then placed under stringent directed selection to generate and identify highly potent agents. ColoAd1, a complex Ad3/Ad11p chimeric virus, was the initial oncolytic virus derived by this novel methodology. ColoAd1, the first described non-Ad5-based oncolytic Ad, is 2-3 logs more potent and selective than the parent serotypes or the most clinically advanced oncolytic Ad, ONYX-015, in vitro. ColoAd1's efficacy was further tested in vivo in a colon cancer liver metastasis xenograft model following intravenous injection and its ex vivo selectivity was demonstrated on surgically-derived human colorectal tumor tissues. Lastly, we demonstrated the ability to arm ColoAd1 with an exogenous gene establishing the potential to impact the treatment of cancer on multiple levels from a single agent.Question: Does directed evolution generate a novel oncolytic virus for the treatment of colon cancer?

Six of Zindel's books, in fact, have been voted the Best Books for Young Adults, and most of his recent horror books--such as The Doom Stone and Rats--have been chosen as Quick Picks for Reluctant Young Adult Readers. Clearly, he was a writer who knew how to interest contemporary children. Recognizing that, the American Library Association in 2002 honored Paul Zindel with the Margaret A. Edwards Prize for his lifetime achievements , and later that same year he was presented with the ALAN Prize for his contributions to Young Adult Literature. With his passing, young readers, teachers, and librarians have lost a great friend.

These agreements are..... ||||| (CNN) President Donald Trump publicly undermined his attorney Rudy Giuliani on Friday , saying the former New York City mayor had only a loose grasp of the Stormy Daniels business when he spoke about it earlier this week. A clarifying statement from Giuliani issued four hours later did little to illuminate the matter. Instead, the series of pronouncements only lent further confusion to an issue that has deeply undercut the administration's credibility and has fueled the impression of a West Wing in crisis. \\"He''ll get his facts straight,\\" Trump stipulated of his longtime friend on Friday morning, before adding: \\"There has been a lot of misinformation. I say, You know what? Learn before you speak. It's a lot easier.\\" Calling Giuliani a \\"great guy,\\" Trump nonetheless insisted his attorney wasn't fully up to speed when he told an interviewer that Trump had reimbursed another lawyer for hush money paid to Daniels , an adult film actress who claims she had sex with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied the encounter. \\"He really has his heart into it. He's working hard,\\" Trump said of Giuliani, before adding: \\"He's learning the subject matter.\\" By midday, Giuliani had issued a statement he said was \\"intended to clarify the views I expressed over the past few days.\\" But it did little to spell out when precisely Trump knew of the payment, or how involved he was in reimbursing Cohen. \\"My references to timing were not describing my understanding of the President's knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters,\\" Giuliani wrote. He asserted the payment would have been made \\"whether he was a candidate or not.\\" Seeking clarity Trump sought to clarify the matter during a pair of morning appearances as he departed for Dallas, where he will address the National Rifle Association. He spoke first outside the South Portico, as his Marine One helicopter was idling nearby, and again under the wing of Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews. It was his first time speaking about the matter after Giuliani sat for an interview this week and claimed Trump had paid back his lawyer Michael Cohen for the 130,000 hush payment to Daniels, an adult film actress whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford. Trump seemed to initially back up Giuliani's statement on Twitter the morning after his interview. But he reversed course on Friday. \\"Everything said has been said incorrectly,\\" he said. Giuliani, who announced he was joining Trump's legal team 15 days ago, \\"started yesterday,\\" the President insisted. \\"When Rudy made the statements -- Rudy is great -- but Rudy had just started, and he wasn't totally familiar with everything,\\" he said. Trump had previously said he wasn't aware of the payment. He told reporters aboard Air Force One a month ago \\"no\\" when questioned about his knowledge of the arrangement.

You go back and take a look,\\" he ordered. \\"You'll see what I said.\\" The remarkable series of appearances did little to clarify matters, which have served to erode the credibility both of the President and his aides, who insisted Trump knew nothing of the hush payments. Trump, however, said there should be no confusion. \\"It's actually very simple,\\" he declared without explanation.

There was little indication beforehand that Giuliani had planned to reveal the payment details on Wednesday night, despite his insistence that he remains aligned with his client. \\"You wont see daylight between me and the President,\\" Giuliani told CNN's Dana Bash on Thursday. If there was a strategy cooked up between the President and his lawyer, most White House aides were left in the dark. Chief of staff John Kelly was among the aides who watched the Giuliani interview with shock on Wednesday. Kelly's stature inside the White House has long been the subject of speculation. But Trump sought to bolster his standing on Friday. \\"We have a great relationship. He's doing a great job as chief of staff. I could not be more happy,\\" Trump said. \\"So I just want to tell you that.\\" ||||| ...despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair.

A: go to a party B: apologize C: be alone","completion":"Based on the context provided, it seems that Alex has pushed Quinn away and announced he wanted privacy. This indicates Alex is likely seeking some alone time, potentially to think, reflect, or address personal matters. Considering the three answer options provided: A: Go to a party - This answer doesn't seem to align with the context, as going to a party would be the opposite of wanting privacy. Choosing this option would put Alex in a social environment, which is not what he seems to be looking for right now. B: Apologize - Although apologizing might be a possibility in the future once Alex has had his time alone, at this moment, it does not seem like the immediate action he wants to take. Alex appears to need some space to process his feelings and thoughts before addressing any issues with Quinn or apologizing. C: Be alone - This answer aligns with the context provided the best, as Alex has explicitly stated that he wants privacy. Selecting this option would give him time to think and reflect in solitude, possibly helping him sort out his emotions and thoughts. After a period of being alone, he may then choose to apologize to Quinn if he feels it is necessary or find other ways to handle his feelings and the situation with Quinn.

The vibrant strings of lanterns, draped carelessly between rustic buildings, painted a joyful picture as they swayed with the rhythm of the soft evening wind. Laughter echoed, creating a symphony with the musicians whose melodies captivated every heart within hearing distance. Seeing her apprehension wane, he led Elisabeth towards the musicians, their tunes a harmonious amalgamation of the fiddle, the harp and the bagpipe. The rhythm was infectious, and soon enough even the most reluctant toes itched to join in the dance. David's heart warmed as he led Elisabeth gently into the dance. As a seasoned sailor, his footing was sure, and Elisabeth seemed to glide by his side. Her long, flaxen hair twirled and spun in the orbit defined by their dance, a moon revolving around an invisible planet. The darkness of her eyes sparkled with laughter and joy, a sight he had been longing for in the relentless hustle and bustle of their daily lives. As he steered them into the heart of the celebration, swinging Elisabeth around in time with the raucous tempo of the fiddle, he couldn't help but get lost in the tranquility of the moment. Allowing the exuberance of their simple lives to bubble up inside him until it reflected in his laughter, reflecting back at Elisabeth's equally radiant smile. Their thoughts centered around the rhythm, forgetting the troubles of the day, if only for a while. Time danced away as the couple lost themselves in the rhythm of the music; the concerns of the day fading into nothingness. The boys' naughtiness almost seemed endearing under the spell of the evening. The level of detail each tune possessed, the way Elisabeth twirled in David's arms, her hand fitting perfectly into his, it truly was a bit of the evening they had left to explore and cherish. Under the canopy of twilight, amidst the crescendo of the evening's enchanting music, their laughter merged into harmonious symphony; a testament of the happiness found in simplicity, a rare moment of respite from their mundane routines. As the last notes of the melody floated into the nighttime air, a loud cheer went up from the villagers in unison, clapping their hands and stamping their feet in a jovial celebration of life. David, holding Elisabeth's waist gently, looked down into her sparkling eyes, a soft tug of happiness pricking the corners of his own. \\"See? We've a bit of evening left, Lisbeth.\\" He said, gesturing towards their boys, who were now running towards them, breathless and flushed, but with unmistakable happiness plastered on their faces. A chapter of their lives concluded with the winding down of the village music, one they'd fondly remember as the night they danced under the stars; surrounded by music, caught in laughter, and enveloped in love. And as the boys reached them, panting and throwing their exhausted selves into the adults' open arms, it was a stamp of agreement on David's words.

Diesel fuel is heavier and oilier than petrol, resulting in several issues: 1. Misfiring and Poor Combustion: Petrol engines and diesel engines use different methods to ignite the air-fuel mixture. Petrol engines utilize spark ignition, while diesel engines rely on compression ignition. When diesel fuel enters a petrol engine, the spark plugs cannot ignite the diesel properly, leading to misfires and poor combustion. 2. Damage to Components: Diesel fuel can cause the petrol engine's fuel injectors, spark plugs, and the exhaust system to become clogged or damaged due to the difference in fuel properties. Deposits can build upon engine components and hinder their performance. 3. Reduced Efficiency: Since diesel fuel cannot be burned effectively in a petrol engine, the engine will run inefficiently, resulting in reduced power, stalling, and increased fuel consumption. The best course of action when diesel is accidentally put into a petrol engine is to drain the fuel tank, flush the fuel system with the correct petrol, and replace any affected components. Damage to the engine will likely be minimal if the vehicle has not been driven, but if it has, repairs can be costly. Question 2: What happens if petrol is used in a diesel engine? Using petrol in a diesel engine can have more severe consequences than the reverse situation. Because of the differences in how diesel and petrol engines operate, these issues can occur: 1. Insufficient Lubrication: Diesel fuel acts as a lubricant in the engine's fuel system, whereas petrol fails to do so. When petrol enters a diesel engine, it can cause metal-to-metal contact within the fuel system components, leading to friction, wear, and potential damage. 2. Detonation: The ignition point of petrol is much lower than diesel. This creates pre-ignition or detonation in a diesel engine, which can cause engine knocking, overheating, and, in severe cases, damage to critical engine components such as pistons, connecting rods, and valves. 3. Complete Engine Failure: If substantial amounts of petrol are used in a diesel engine, it can result in complete engine failure due to a combination of aforementioned factors. In some cases, repairs might be possible, but a full engine change could be necessary. When petrol is accidentally added to a diesel engine, it's crucial to stop driving and turn off the engine immediately. Draining the fuel tank, flushing the fuel system with diesel, and inspecting the engine for any severe damage are essential steps to address the situation. In summary, the answer to whether the consequences of these two questions are the same is no. While both scenarios can lead to engine problems, using petrol in a diesel engine tends to cause more severe damage, whereas using diesel in a petrol engine can lead to milder issues if promptly addressed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Nutty Professor Movie plot: At Wellman College, thousands of hamsters overrun the campus, due to the massively obese, yet loving and kind-hearted, professor Sherman Klump, who accidentally releases them. Meanwhile, Sherman has created an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person in a way that allows them to lose weight more easily. After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with Carla Purty, a chemistry graduate student who is a big fan of his work. After dinner with his obese, impolite family, Sherman asks Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to Sherman's surprise. The date begins well with Carla showing admiration for Sherman's work, but the club's obnoxious comic Reggie Warrington publicly humiliates him about his weight. Sherman becomes depressed and has a nightmare in which he becomes a rampaging giant and wrecks the city with a single fart that is ignited to cause an explosion. He tests his serum on himself and loses 300 pounds in seconds. Overwhelmed by his thinness, he goes out and buys copious amounts of normal-sized clothing to celebrate, and a 47,000 Viper sports car on his faculty expense account. To conceal his true identity, Sherman adopts a fake name, \\"Buddy Love\\", and invites Carla out on a date at the same club again (while the serum begins to wear off). Reggie is present again and Buddy takes revenge and heckles him mercilessly. Sherman's \\"Buddy\\" persona starts to develop an independent personality due to the heightened testosterone levels of the transformation, causing him to be overly assertive and confident. Klump's assistant Jason witnesses Buddy fleeing the scene after he is identified as the person who left Klump's credit card on the bar. Jason follows Buddy and witnesses the transformation back into Klump. The next morning, Dean Richmond has set up a meeting with wealthy Harlan Hartley at The Ritz to have Sherman explain the serum in the hopes of gaining Hartley's 10 million donation to the science department. However, Sherman arrives at The Ritz as Buddy with Carla....","completion":"In the movie \\"The Nutty Professor,\\" Sherman Klump's nightmares were triggered after being publicly humiliated by the obnoxious comic Reggie Warrington at the club, where he made fun of Sherman's weight.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 0 = 175*r - 188*r - 156 for r.","completion":"Alright little buddy, let's solve this math problem together. We need to find the value of r when the equation is equal to 0. Here's the equation: 0 = 175*r - 188*r - 156. First, let's see what happens if we combine the part with r in it (175*r and 188*r). Since 188*r is being subtracted, we can think of it as -188*r. So: 175*r - 188*r Can be thought of like having 175 apples and then taking away 188 apples. If we do that, we will be left with: -13*r Now, let's put that back into the equation: 0 = -13*r - 156 Next, we need to get rid of the -156 by adding 156 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 156 = -13*r So now we have: 156 = -13*r Now, we want to know how many times -13 goes into 156, so we can find the value of r. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -13: 156 / -13 = (-13*r) / -13 That gives us: -12 = r So, the value of r is -12.

Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1. The textbook \\"Of Pandas and People\\" was published by an organization based in what city and state? Answer:","completion":"The textbook \\"Of Pandas and People\\" was published by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE), an organization based in Richardson, Texas. This controversial textbook was first published in 1989 and served as an alternative to the standard biology textbooks that primarily focused on the theory of evolution. The book was written by Percival Davis and Dean H. Kenyon, with a forward by Charles B. Thaxton. As a creationist textbook, \\"Of Pandas and People\\" puts forth the idea of intelligent design, advocating that certain complex biological systems and living organisms are best explained by an intelligent agent rather than an undirected process such as natural selection. In the case of this book, the intelligent agent is understood to be a supernatural deity. The book's central argument is that irreducibly complex biological systems provide evidence for intelligent design. The authors contend that these systems, due to their complexity, cannot be explained by the gradual process of evolution; rather, they must have been designed by an intelligent being. \\"Of Pandas and People\\" has been the subject of significant controversy, particularly in the United States where it has been at the center of legal battles over teaching alternatives to evolution in public schools. The most notable case involving this textbook was Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005, where a federal court ruled that teaching intelligent design in science classrooms violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as it promotes a particular religious viewpoint. In conclusion, \\"Of Pandas and People\\" is a creationist textbook published by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics, an organization based in the city of Richardson, Texas. The book presents the idea of intelligent design as an alternative to the theory of evolution, arguing that complex biological systems are best explained by the existence of an intelligent agent, such as a deity. The textbook and its ideas have faced significant opposition and controversy, largely due to concerns about the promotion of religious ideology in scientific education."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, (; born Lourens Alma Tadema Dutch pronunciation: ['l^ur@ns 'alma: 'ta:d@,ma:]; 8 January 1836 - 25 June 1912) was a Dutch painter of special British denizenship. Context: In 1852 he entered the Royal Academy of Antwerp in Belgium where he studied early Dutch and Flemish art, under Gustaf Wappers. During Alma-Tadema's four years as a registered student at the Academy, he won several respectable awards. Before leaving school, towards the end of 1855, he became assistant to the painter and professor Louis (Lodewijk) Jan de Taeye, whose courses in history and historical costume he had greatly enjoyed at the Academy. Although de Taeye was not an outstanding painter, Alma-Tadema respected him and became his studio assistant, working with him for three years. De Taeye introduced him to books that influenced his desire to portray Merovingian subjects early in his career. He was encouraged to depict historical accuracy in his paintings, a trait for which the artist became known. Alma-Tadema left Taeye's studio in November 1858 returning to Leeuwarden before settling in Antwerp, where he began working with the painter Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys, whose studio was one of the most highly regarded in Belgium. Under his guidance Alma-Tadema painted his first major work: The Education of the children of Clovis (1861). This painting created a sensation among critics and artists when it was exhibited that year at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp. It is said to have laid the foundation of his fame and reputation. Alma-Tadema related that although Leys thought the completed painting better than he had expected, he was critical of the treatment of marble, which he compared to cheese. Alma-Tadema took this criticism very seriously, and it led him to improve his technique and to become the world's foremost painter of marble and variegated granite. Despite any reproaches from his master, The Education of the Children of Clovis was honorably received by critics and artists alike and was eventually purchased and subsequently given to King Leopold of Belgium. Question: Why did he move there? Answer:","completion":"Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, also known as Lourens Alma Tadema, moved to different places to learn more and grow as an artist. He first went to the Royal Academy of Antwerp in Belgium to study art under Gustaf Wappers.

Context: The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \\"commonsense\\" move. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday. In a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department. \\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy. A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday. But Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect — discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results. \\"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 — too much is at stake,\\" Rep. Carolyn Maloney, co-chair of the Congressional Census Caucus, told VOA. \\"The census mandated by the [U.S.] Constitution affects the way that Federal and state funds are distributed and how district lines are drawn for both the city, state and Federal level.\\" Question: After the end of this story, Maloney is probably Answer: Answer:","completion":"concerned about the potential negative impacts of the citizenship question on the accuracy and fairness of the 2020 census."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Review: fifth beer-soaked film Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"The phrase \\"fifth beer-soaked film\\" appears to carry a negative connotation with regards to the movie review. Firstly, let's break down the sentence to understand the implications better. 1. \\"Fifth\\": The use of the term \\"fifth\\" suggests that this movie might be a part of a series or that the reviewer has seen multiple similar films before. This could potentially imply that the movie lacks originality or is just one among the many similar productions. It may also imply that the viewer has become fatigued by such films, leading to a negative perception. 2. \\"Beer-soaked\\": The phrase \\"beer-soaked\\" generally creates an image of something that is messy, dirty, or lacking refinement. In the context of a movie review, it could be interpreted that the film is crude, lowbrow, or has an abundance of vulgar content. \\"Beer-soaked\\" may also be an indication of the film targeting or appealing to a specific group of people with a certain taste, such as those who enjoy lighthearted, party-like, or heavy drinking-related themes. These traits are often seen as negative in the context of a film review, so this term also contributes to the overall negative tone of the sentence. 3. \\"Film\\": The simplest word in the sentence, \\"film\\" is neutral as it just refers to the movie being reviewed. Taking these aspects into consideration, it can be inferred that the movie review sentence contains a negative opinion. This stems from the suggestion that the film lacks originality or sophistication and has negative associations due to the \\"beer-soaked\\" adjective. Although people's preferences may vary, and some might appreciate this type of film, the overall tone of the sentence gives the impression that the reviewer does not consider it to be a positive or high-quality production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Hammer-ons and pull-offs are two essential techniques to use if you're soloing on guitar. With a hammer-on, you basically tap the string with your finger on a higher fret to play another note without strumming. A pull-off is the reverse, when you remove a finger on a higher fret so that the string plays a lower note. When done correctly, the 2 notes slur together, creating a smoother sound. And since you don't have to strum each note separately, you can play much faster. Combine the techniques and go back and forth between 2 notes for several beats to create a sort of trill in your solo. This works well at the end of phrases. It's commonly understood that lead guitarists play single notes rather than chords – but there's no rule that says you can never play a chord just because you're the lead guitarist. Use chords to add body to root notes in your solo or emphasize a particular phrase. For example, if you used whole notes to build the basic outline of the structure of your solo, you could play some or all of those notes as chords, then fill in with single notes in between. To bend a string, fret it with 2 fingers and pull it across the fingerboard. As the string gets tighter, the pitch will go up. Pull from your wrist to bend the string, using your fingers as levers. This puts less pressure on your fingers and wrist by distributing the effort. Don't try to bend a string if it's not in tune. You could break the string. If you've never bent strings before, it's a technique that will take some practice to get right. Play the note you want to bend, then the note you want to bend the string to. That way you'll know when you've bent it far enough. Vibrato is a technique similar to string bending, except that you gently move the string up and down for a slight variation in pitch. Lock your fretting finger against the neck of your guitar to get a good pivot point, then wobble that finger up and down after strumming the note. Vibrato is more difficult on the outside strings, since you don't want to pull the strings off the side of the neck. Experiment with your vibrato, doing it at different speeds and bending the string at different distances. A small, slow vibrato is typically more appropriate for ballads while bending the string further and faster works well with rock songs. Listen to guitarists you admire and watch their solo technique. If you see something you like, practice it and try to emulate it. The same goes for motifs or riffs that capture your attention. Simply copying others won't make you a great guitarist. Once you've learned how to emulate someone else's idea, play around with it and try to make it your own. All guitarists have influences, but the greatest have a signature style that builds on their influences rather than mimicking them.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Introduction Each somatic cell in the body generally contains the same DNA. A few exceptions include red blood cells, which contain no DNA in their mature state, and some immune system cells that rearrange their DNA while producing antibodies. In general, however, the genes that determine whether you have green eyes, brown hair, and how fast you metabolize food are the same in the cells in your eyes and your liver, even though these organs function quite differently. If each cell has the same DNA, how is it that cells or organs are different? Why do cells in the eye differ so dramatically from cells in the liver? Whereas each cell shares the same genome and DNA sequence, each cell does not turn on, or express, the same set of genes. Each cell type needs a different set of proteins to perform its function. Therefore, only a small subset of proteins is expressed in a cell. For the proteins to be expressed, the DNA must be transcribed into RNA and the RNA must be translated into protein. In a given cell type, not all genes encoded in the DNA are transcribed into RNA or translated into protein because specific cells in our body have specific functions. Specialized proteins that make up the eye (iris, lens, and cornea) are only expressed in the eye, whereas the specialized proteins in the heart (pacemaker cells, heart muscle, and valves) are only expressed in the heart. At any given time, only a subset of all of the genes encoded by our DNA are expressed and translated into proteins. The expression of specific genes is a highly regulated process with many levels and stages of control. This complexity ensures the proper expression in the proper cell at the proper time.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\".

Once the piano accompanist finally arrived, the recital started with haste. The stage was beautifully decorated with blooming flowers and elegant backdrop, and the multi-colored stage lights illuminated the performers as they showcased their talents. One after another, the young dancers impressed everyone present with their graceful moves, intricate choreography and exceptional stage presence. As the recital went on, whispers spread among the crowd about a late addition to the performance - a surprise dance number to be performed by the senior dance troupe. This last minute addition created a wave of excitement, but also caused the recital to stretch past its scheduled time. Despite the delay, the sense of anticipation remained high as the girls in the senior dance troupe waited in the wings with bated breath, dressed in their shimmering costumes and ethereal makeup. They had put together this surprise performance with the guidance of their dedicated and talented dance instructor, Ms. Leanne. This final, unanticipated performance was an ambitious fusion of ballet, contemporary, and jazz styles. At last, the surprise routine began with a haunting piano melody, filling the auditorium with an atmosphere of wonder and grace. The girls glided onto the stage, their movements fluid and mesmerizing. Each dancer exuded the passion for their art form, displaying the connection between their heart, body, and soul. The tempo of the music gradually increased, unfolding the true depth of the performance. Stomping their feet to the beat with determined precision, the dancers began incorporating acrobatics and lifts into their routine. The audience watched, transfixed, as the girls demonstrated the extent of their skills; a culmination of years of dedication, practice, and hard work. As the piece reached its climax, the piano melody transformed into an invigorating and dramatic chorus with a powerful crescendo. The girls moved in perfect unison, their bodies telling an emotional story of strength, resilience, and beauty. As the music began to fade, the girls slowed down, transitioning into a poignant finale. One by one, they struck their final poses before the piano delivered its last note. The audience, spellbound by the performance, remained silent for a moment before erupting into thunderous applause. Overwhelmed by the emotional journey they had been through, both the dancers and the audience were moved to tears. As the girls took their well-deserved bows, the parents in the audience couldn't help but swell with pride at what their children had accomplished.

On 11 February, one day after the conclusion of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore.

A:","completion":"A: The High Middle Ages institution that the Archbishop of Tyre, William of Tyre, attended for twenty years is the University of Bologna in Italy. William of Tyre was a prominent scholar, cleric, and diplomat who primarily served as the Archbishop of Tyre from 1175 to 1184. Born around 1130, he began his education at a young age, studying both religious and secular subjects. His pursuit of higher education eventually led him to the University of Bologna, one of the oldest universities in the world. Established in 1088, the University of Bologna is located in Bologna, Italy. It is renowned for its academics, particularly in the fields of law, theology, medicine, and the arts. During the High Middle Ages, it gained recognition as an influential institution, attracting scholars and students from various regions. It played a significant role in advancing knowledge, fostering intellectual exchange, and shaping European culture. During his twenty-year stay at the University of Bologna, William of Tyre studied various subjects, including theology, philosophy, and law. His education at this prestigious institution helped shape his breadth of knowledge and his aptitude for diplomacy, critical thinking, and communication. It was here he mastered Latin, which enabled him to record his magnum opus, 'Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum' (History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea), a vital historical document chronicling the events of the Crusades and providing significant insight into the political, religious, and cultural milieu of his time. Upon his return to the Holy Land, William of Tyre became a prominent figure in the Crusader States, serving as an advisor to kings and taking part in significant political and ecclesiastical events. His extensive education at the University of Bologna, accompanied by his keen observation and critical thinking skills, made him an essential contributor to historical records and intellectual life during the High Middle Ages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They are known as the \\"Flawless Four\\" who are the most popular girls in Reagan High School in southern California. The clique consists of Courtney Shayne (Rose McGowan) known as Satan-in-heels; Marcie Fox (Julie Benz) known as 'Foxy'; Julie Freeman (Rebecca Gayheart); and Elizabeth Purr (Charlotte Ayanna), known as the \\"Princess Di of Reagan High.\\" Of the four, Elizabeth Purr was the only one who was genuinely kind-hearted and loved by the entire school. Julie was \\"doomed to be popular because of 'that face' and because she was best friends with Elizabeth Purr\\". Cold-blooded queen bee Courtney and her airheaded friend, Marcie, demand respect through terror.However, Courtney, Marcie and Julie play a mindless prank on Liz the morning of her seventeenth birthday, by performing a fake kidnapping: They surprise Liz in bed, bind her with ropes (with Courtney ramming a jawbreaker candyball into her mouth to gag her) and cover it with duct tape. The girls trap Liz, dressed only in a shirt and panties, in the trunk of a car, as she struggles and squeals through her gag, and drive off. They plan to take the bound, gagged, and helpless girl to a restaurant and \\"stuff her face with pancakes\\". However, upon opening the trunk, they are greeted with the grisly sight of Liz dead, having choked to death by aspirating the jawbreaker into her larynx.Horrified, Julie wants to go to the police but Courtney forbids her. Instead, Courtney calls the school pretending to be Liz's mother and tells them Liz is ill and cannot attend school. To keep up appearances, Courtney, Marcie and Julie then go to school as though nothing had happened. When the principal sends school outcast Fern Mayo (Judy Greer) to deliver Liz's homework at the end of the day, she stumbles upon the three girls and Liz's mangled and decomposing body.

In 2015, the European Commission said it would investigate whether Google \\"abused its dominant position\\" and \\"hindered the development\\" of rivals. Google argued Android was a \\"flexible\\" platform that had \\"expanded competition\\" rather than hurting it. The European Commission told the BBC it would carefully consider Google's response before making a decision. The Android operating system is open source, with a majority of the code available for device manufacturers to take, modify and use for free. Companies are free to take the code and develop it into their own operating system - shopping giant Amazon has done so with its Fire OS. However, manufacturers must negotiate with Google if they wish to add Google Mobile Services (GMS), which include the popular Google Play app store, Chrome web browser and Google Search app. The European Commission is investigating whether Google: Google faces a fine and could be required to change its practices if it is found guilty. The search giant has not denied offering phone-makers incentives to exclusively pre-install Google apps, or that it offers Search, Chrome and the Play app store as a bundle. But it argued: \\"We do offer manufacturers a suite of apps so that when you buy a new phone, you can access a familiar set of basic services,\\" the company said in a blog. \\"Android's competitors - including Apple's iPhone and Microsoft's Windows phone - not only do the same, but they allow much less choice in the apps that come with their phones.\\" In April, Ms Vestager indicated that she believed Google had broken antitrust rules. \\"Based on our investigation thus far, we believe that Google's behaviour denies consumers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and stands in the way of innovation by other players,\\" she said.

The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages, where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield, who was normally subordinate to a captain general. - Social work is an academic and practice-based professional discipline that seeks to facilitate the welfare of communities, individuals, families, and groups. It may promote social change, development, cohesion, and empowerment. Underpinned by theories of social sciences and guided by principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility, and respect for diversities, social work engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance well-being. - The German Empire (officially ') was the historical German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918, when Germany became a federal republic (the Weimar Republic). - Battle of Kaniv, or Battle of Kaniów took place during World War I on the night of 1011 May 1918, near Kaniv, Ukraine between Polish and German army troops. The fighting pitted the Polish II Corps in Russia (including Brigade II of the Polish Legions), under general Józef Haller von Hallenburg, against the German Imperial Army (including the 28th Landwehr Brigade), under general Zierhold. Ultimately the Germans were victorious with about half of the Polish forces surrendering and the rest retreating in disarray. - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved. - The Triple Entente (from French \\"entente\\" \\"friendship, understanding, agreement\\") was the understanding linking the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente on 31 August 1907. The understanding between the three powers, supplemented by agreements with Japan and Portugal, constituted a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Italy, though Italy did not side with Germany and Austria during World War I, and joined the Entente Powers instead, in the 1915 Treaty of London. - The Order of Polonia Restituta is a Polish state order established 4 February 1921.

The union was a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and came into existence on 30 March 1867. Austria-Hungary consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the CroatianHungarian Settlement (\\"Nagodba\\") in 1868. It was ruled by the House of Habsburg, and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal. Foreign affairs and the military came under joint oversight, but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states. - The Battle of Raracza was fought between Polish Legionnaires, and Austria-Hungary, from February 15 to 16, 1918, near Raracza in Bukovina, and ended with a Polish victory. - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery.

It was composed of three parts: the joint army (\\", \\"Common Army\\", recruited from all parts of the country), the Imperial Austrian Landwehr (recruited from Cisleithania), and the Royal Hungarian Honved (recruited from Transleithania). - Cisleithania (also \\"Zisleithanien\\", , , , , , , , , transliterated: \\"Tsysleitàniia\\") was a common yet unofficial denotation of the northern and western part of Austria-Hungary, the Dual Monarchy created in the Compromise of 1867as distinguished from \\"Transleithania\\", i.e. the Hungarian Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen east of (\\"beyond\\") the Leitha River. - Dual monarchy occurs when two separate kingdoms are ruled by the same monarch, follow the same foreign policy, exist in a customs union with each other and have a combined military but are otherwise self-governing. The term is typically used to refer to AustriaHungary, a dual monarchy that existed from 1867 to 1918. - A civil servant or public servant is a person in the public sector employed for a government department or agency.

The Legions became \\"a founding myth for the creation of modern Poland\\" in spite of their considerably short existence; they were replaced by the Polish Auxiliary Corps formation on 20 September 1916, merged with Polish II Corps in Russia on 19 February 1918 for the Battle of Raracza against Austria-Hungary, and disbanded following the military defeat at the Battle of Kaniów in May 1918, against imperial Germany.

Pinching refers to the pinching off of the top of the stems of a plant to encourage bushy growth and blossoming. Pinching can be done alongside the removal of dead blooms in late spring to early summer, as doing it before winter can also cause the mum to be vulnerable to the cold weather. Pinching is not strictly necessary but is a good addition to your deadheading routine, as it can make your plant fuller and healthier while keeping the shape of the plant compact and bushy. Because pinching is best done on tall stalks that you want bushier and more fruitful, take a good look during the late spring and early summer for stalks that you want shorter. It’s best to pinch your mums once the new shoots that emerge in the spring are 3 to 4 inches (7.62- 10.16 cm) high. Also look for any tips that look dead or browned. Once you have identified some stalks that should be pinched, grasp the tip of a shoot right under the first set of leaves, about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 cm) down the stem from the tip. Use your fingernails to pinch off this tip and discard the pinched off tip of the plant. Repeat the process of pinching on all unhealthy or overly-tall stems. Pinching not only shortens the height of a tall plant, it also allows encourages rapid growth of leaves and blooms right below the pinched off area. The optimal time to stop pinching for most mums is in mid July so that the plant has time to blossom and grow before blooming season. If your mum plant is an early cultivator then you should stop around mid-June, and if it is a late cultivator like a “Minnyellow” or a “Minngopher” mum, you can get away stopping pinching around early August. Look up your type of mum to see whether it is an early or a late cultivator. Summary:","completion":"Pinching is the process of removing the top of a plant's stems to encourage bushy growth and blossoming. This technique can be done alongside deadheading in late spring to early summer, helping to create a fuller and healthier plant while maintaining a compact and bushy shape. To pinch your mums, begin when new shoots are 3 to 4 inches (7.62- 10.16 cm) high. Identify tall or unhealthy stalks and pinch off the tips right under the first set of leaves, about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 cm) down the stem. Repeat this on all necessary stems. Pinching not only shortens the plant but also promotes growth of leaves and blooms just below the pinched area. The best time to stop pinching varies based on the type of mum and whether it is an early or late cultivator. Most mums should have pinching stopped by mid-July, while early cultivators need to stop around mid-June and late cultivators like \\"Minnyellow\\" or \\"Minngopher\\" mums can continue until early August.

Paragraph: IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.

Context: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore. Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size. \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\" While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores. The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added. For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\" The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy.

Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him?, using the article: Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums. Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects., what would be the answer ?

Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Solve for 's'. The given equation is: 53*s - 492 = -33*s - 67*s + 5475 Step 1: Combine like terms. On the right side of the equation, we have two 's' terms, -33*s and -67*s. Let's combine these terms: -33*s - 67*s = (-33 - 67) * s = -100*s So, the equation becomes: 53*s - 492 = -100*s + 5475 Step 2: Isolate the variable 's'. To do this, let's add 100*s to both sides of the equation to move all 's' terms to the left side: 53*s + 100*s - 492 = -100*s + 100*s + 5475 This simplifies to: 153*s - 492 = 5475 Now, to completely isolate 's', we need to add 492 to both sides of the equation: 153*s - 492 + 492 = 5475 + 492 This simplifies to: 153*s = 5967 Step 3: Solve for 's'. Now, we just need to divide both sides of the equation by 153 to find the value of 's': s = 5967 / 153 s ≈ 39 So the answer is: s ≈ 39"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: That fall came and I went back to Michigan and the school year went by and summer came and I never really thought about it. I'm not even sure if I was officially asked, I just wound up heading back to New Jersey when school was out. I think my parents thought it was a good enough deal. They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point. I think she saw me as sort of foisted off on her and getting in the way of her summers. Which was a fair enough judgment. But she could have been nicer. It's pretty amazing that she wound up as my Maid of Honor. Time does strange things. Your lovable jack-ass of a father would mention something about magic in here. You know if you took a group of fifty strangers, had them chat with your father for half an hour then with me for half an hour, then told them that one of us was an English Professor and one of us was head of distribution in the northeast for a large soft drink manufacturing concern, I'm pretty sure all fifty would peg your father as the English Professor and me as the head of distribution. He's honestly so good at what he does that I can almost allow him to claim it's magic except that it'd be nice if he took credit for some of the things he's done with his life.

A:","completion":"A: On the surface Ticks are a type of parasitic arachnid that rely on blood meals for their survival and reproduction. They are commonly found in wooded and grassy areas where they patiently await potential hosts, such as humans or animals, to pass by. Among the given answer choices, \\"on the surface\\" is the most accurate answer, as ticks attach themselves to the skin of their host. When they sense a potential host's body heat, scent, or carbon dioxide from their breath, they quickly climb on and use their mouthparts to pierce the skin. Once attached, they hold onto the host with their sharp barbs and secrete a cement-like substance, which ensures they remain in place while feeding. Although ticks may occasionally also be found in loose soil or on animals, it is ultimately the surface of an organism's body where they attach themselves and feed. It is important to note that ticks do not live directly within the blood, in an organism's mouth, or behind the teeth. They act as ectoparasites, which means that they live on the exterior of their hosts. Ticks are known carriers of several pathogens that can cause diseases in humans and animals, such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and tularemia.

To answer the question, another word for when alloys solidify is \\"solidification\\" or \\"crystallization.\\" The process of solidification in the context of alloys involves the cooling of the molten alloy until it reaches its solid-state. This process starts when the alloy's constituents, such as metals or other elements, mix together in a liquid state at high temperatures, and then solidify when cooled down. During the solidification process, the alloy's properties, such as strength and toughness, can be influenced by factors like cooling rates and the formation of different microstructures within the material."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who started calling himself Varg Vikernes? , can you please find it? In the 1980s, a young guitarist called Euronymous forms a black metal band called Mayhem, the first of the genre in their country of Norway, with Necrobutcher on bass, and Manheim on drums. Manhein leaves and is soon replaced by new drummer Hellhammer and they recruit a new vocalist from Sweden called Dead, who exhibits self-destructive behavior, which he portrays during their live shows by cutting himself and bleeding on the audience, and throwing pig heads at the \\"posers\\". At a show filmed by their friend Metalion, the band meets a fan named Kristian, whom Euronymous initially looks down on. While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken away, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band. Soon after, Euronymous starts his own black metal record label and opens a record shop called Helvete, which becomes a social hub for black-metallers like Metalion, Fenriz of Darkthrone, Faust of Emperor, and Kristian (who is now calling himself Varg Vikernes) of Burzum. They become known as the \\"Black Circle\\". After being mocked by an ego-driven Euronymous, Varg uses his anti-Christian beliefs as motivation to burn down a local church. When approached by Varg concerning his status as the leader of the Black Circle, Euronymous burns down a church with Faust and Varg accompanying. Euronymous recruits Varg as bassist, a guitarist called Blackthorn and a Hungarian vocalist, Attila Csihar, to record Mayhem's first album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. A power dispute between Varg and Euronymous arises. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Kristian, who later started calling himself Varg Vikernes, is the person who adopted the name.

Options: - pleasure - carpal tunnel syndrome - medical bill - eye strain - increased efficiency Explain why a human would choose \\"carpal tunnel syndrome\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"carpal tunnel syndrome\\" as the answer to the question because if a person is paralyzed, they typically have limited or no control over their limbs. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a health condition that affects the hand and wrist, caused by the compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel. This condition is often the result of repetitive hand movements or long-term improper hand positioning, which might not be applicable to someone who is paralyzed. In the context of the question, paralysis minimizes the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome while using a computer. The other options potentially can still happen even if someone is paralyzed. For example, a paralyzed person could still experience pleasure, medical bills, eye strain, and increased efficiency while using a computer with the help of accessible technology.

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Altrincham became a Free Borough, a self-governing township, when it was granted a charter in June 1290 by the Lord of the Manor, Hamon de Massey V. The charter allowed for the creation of a merchants' guild, run by the town's burgesses to tax people passing through the borough. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town. The borough was ruled by a Court Leet and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.The borough was not one of those reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, and continued to exist under the control of the Lord of the Manor and the Court Leet until its final abolition in 1886. The Public Health Act of 1848 led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address the unsanitary conditions created by the town's growing population – the first such board in Trafford.The local board was reconstituted as an urban district council in the administrative county of Cheshire under the Local Government Act 1894. Altrincham Urban District was expanded in 1920 when parts of Carrington and Dunham Massey Civil Parishes were added. A further expansion took place in 1936; Timperley Civil Parish was abolished and most of its area incorporated into Altrincham UD. At the same time, there was a minor exchange of areas with Hale Urban District; a minor addition from Bowdon Urban District; and a further substantial portion of Dunham Massey Civil Parish was added. In 1937 the urban district was granted a charter of incorporation and became a municipal borough. The new borough was granted armorial bearings which featured heraldic references to the Masseys and Earls of Stamford. With the passage of the Local Government Act 1972, the administrative counties and municipal boroughs were abolished and Altrincham became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester on 1 April 1974.Trafford Council is responsible for the administration of local services, such as education,...

I had heard and read some buzz about this place and was excited to finally have the chance to give it a try, but unfortunately, my experience has left me feeling completely underwhelmed, and even more than a little frustrated. Allow me to detail the reasons why I have to give this place a negative review. First and foremost, the location is not particularly convenient. Navigating to the spot was frustrating, as the roads were convoluted, and space for parking was scarce. I had to park my car quite a distance from the place and walk a little under a mile just to get there. This was not the best way to start off my visit. Once I finally arrived, I found that the ambiance was not at all what I was expecting. The exterior was shabby and not well-maintained. As for the interior, it was dimly lit, and the overall decor was outdated and unappealing. It gave off the impression that the owners did not care about cultivating a welcoming atmosphere for their customers. The service, unfortunately, matched the poor ambiance. Our server was inattentive and seemed to be more interested in chatting with fellow employees than addressing the needs of the diners. Our order took absolutely ages to be taken down, and even after that, we had to wait an ungodly amount of time just to receive our food. The lack of attentiveness and overall disorganized service was highly frustrating, particularly as the place was not packed. As for the food itself, it fell extremely flat. To be blunt, the flavor palate was practically nonexistent. The dishes lacked creativity, and many ingredients tasted as if they were not fresh or had been poorly stored. The presentation of the plates was also atrocious—a clear indication that no thought had been given to making the dish look appealing. I had hoped that the food would be the saving grace of the visit, but alas, it only further compounded my disappointment. During our entire meal, we were subjected to overly loud and obnoxious music which only added to the disappointment and frustration of our experience. The noise made it nearly impossible to hold a conversation with my fellow diners, and my many attempts to ask the staff to lower the volume were disregarded. Regarding the pricing, this establishment was not at all worth the cost. The inflated prices surely did not correlate with the quality of the food, nor the level of service we received. It felt as if I were being ripped off for an utterly dismal dining experience. In conclusion, my visit to this place has been far from satisfactory, and I regret to say that I cannot in good faith give it a positive review. The poor location, lack of ambiance, terrible service, and incredibly subpar food have all contributed to an experience that left me feeling dissatisfied, frustrated, and wondering how this place has managed to stay in business at all. It is with great disappointment that I have to say: save your time and money and find somewhere else to dine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It starts out well, but once the main hit is done, it devolves into a long subplot around a young girl which is not compelling, and some action scenes which are theatre of the absurd unrealistic. For example there is a prolonged shootout at the airport in which the lighting is all stroboscopic. No explanation for that. How credible is it that a airport storage area is going to have lights that flash on and off confusingly, and just enough to let Snipes do his incredible escape schtick?

For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: x = 3, equation weights = [3, 6, 2] Student:","completion":"Yes, I understand the problem.

Онег Шабат Translate to English English:","completion":"Oneg Shabbat Oneg Shabbat, also spelled Oneg Shabbos or Oneg Shabbath, is a Hebrew term that translates to \\"Sabbath delight\\" or \\"joy of the Sabbath\\" in English. The concept of Oneg Shabbat is rooted in Jewish tradition and is dedicated to experiencing pleasure and enjoyment on the Sabbath (Shabbat), the day of rest prescribed in the Jewish faith. The Sabbath is observed from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday. Oneg Shabbat is an important Jewish custom that involves engaging in pleasurable activities for the mind, body, and soul and spending joyous time with family and friends. It is typically characterized by festive meals and gatherings filled with food, drink, singing, learning, and discussing religious and spiritual topics. The purpose of these gatherings is to honor the Sabbath and reinforce the values and teachings of Judaism. Oneg Shabbat celebrations often take place at home, synagogues, or community centers. Some of the activities and customs associated with Oneg Shabbat include: 1. Lighting the Shabbat candles: This practice symbolizes the separation between the holiness of Shabbat and the everyday workweek. Women and girls typically light the candles just before the sun sets on Friday evening and recite a blessing. 2. Kiddush: At the beginning of the Friday night meal and the Saturday lunch, a special blessing called the Kiddush is recited over a cup of wine or grape juice. This ritual sanctifies the Sabbath and commemorates the creation of the world, as well as the Exodus from Egypt in Jewish history. 3. Challah: During the Sabbath meals, Jews partake of challah, a braided bread that is usually egg-enriched and baked in a round or oblong shape. Two loaves of challah are used to represent the double portion of manna, the miraculous food provided by God, that the Israelites received on Fridays during their 40-year journey in the desert. 4. Seudah Shlishit: It is customary to have three meals during the Sabbath, with the third meal called \\"Seudah Shlishit\\" typically taking place late on Saturday afternoon. Seudah Shlishit is often a lighter meal, consisting of leftovers from the previous meals, salads, fruits, or other light foods. 5. Zemirot: These are traditional Jewish songs or hymns sung during or after Sabbath meals. They feature themes such as gratitude, praise, and joy, further emphasizing the celebration and enjoyment of the Sabbath. 6. Havdalah: As the Sabbath comes to an end, a ceremony called Havdalah is performed to mark the separation between the holy day of rest and the beginning of the new workweek. This ritual involves the use of wine, fragrant spices, and a braided candle to symbolize the multiple aspects of joy experienced during the Sabbath. By partaking in the customs and practices of Oneg Shabbat, Jewish communities worldwide find spiritual rejuvenation, connect with their heritage and values, and take a temporary respite from the pressures and stresses of everyday life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person that calls Laurence to brag? Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation. The following day, Martha meets struggling actor Frank, who has fled an audition in a panic and has gone to the park to console himself with a half-bottle of whiskey. Having heard about her from Daniel, he realizes who she is and calls Laurence to boast that he is about to make her his conquest. He takes her to a nearby art gallery.

During the regime of Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia experienced a period of political turmoil and conflict that was marked by propaganda and media censorship. The local press was tightly controlled by the government and, as a result, most of it served as a tool for promoting its agendas. The press played a significant role in disseminating disinformation and inciting nationalist sentiments among the Serbian population. In the year 2000, following the fall of Milosevic's regime, the Association of Journalists of Serbia (UNS), a professional organization that represents journalists and aims to protect their rights and promote ethical journalism, took a bold step. They decided to investigate and hold accountable those individuals who had contributed to the spread of propaganda and the promotion of the regime's interests within the media. As a result, the Honor Court, an integral part of the association responsible for addressing cases of ethical misconduct, excluded eight editors-in-chief from its membership. This action was a response to their behavior during Milosevic's regime, where they acted as an essential part of the war machine. The expulsion of these individuals sent a message that journalists must adhere to ethical standards and prioritize the truth, especially during such pivotal moments in history.

Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Nine North Koreans defected to the South by boat over the weekend, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday.

The nine defectors made the journey in an engineless boat and are being questioned by South Korean authorities about their motives and their route, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. The development comes four months after a group of 31 North Koreans accidentally crossed over into South Korean waters on a fishing boat.

If I tell you that Mammals are vertebrates, and ask you the question \\"what are vertebrates?\\", is the correct answer \\"jellyfish\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"jellyfish.\\" Vertebrates are a subgroup of animals in the phylum Chordata. They possess a distinguishing characteristic of having a backbone or a vertebral column made of segmented bones called vertebrae (hence the name vertebrates), which surrounds and protects the spinal cord. Additionally, vertebrates have a well-developed head, bilateral symmetry, an endoskeleton, and a complex nervous system that includes a brain. Vertebrates can be further divided into five major groups: fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Since mammals are vertebrates, you've already mentioned the general category that mammals belong to. In contrast, jellyfish belong to the phylum Cnidaria. They are considered invertebrates because they do not possess a backbone or an endoskeleton. Instead, their bodies are composed of a gelatinous substance and they have a simple radial symmetry, which is quite distinct from the characteristics of vertebrates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is there any symbolism behind a bearded man, in terms of religion/holy men/clergy? Are men attractive with a beard or without a beard? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information, as the first question asks about the symbolism of bearded men in a religious context, while the second question is related to the perception of attractiveness of men with and without a beard. To address the first question regarding the symbolism of a bearded man, I will research the different religions and faiths that have traditionally associated beards with their leaders, holy men, or clergy. Step 1: Research about different religions' perspectives on beards. In many religions and cultures, beards have symbolized wisdom, spiritual strength, religious devotion, or maturity. Some examples include: 1. Christianity: In the Orthodox Church, the clergy members often grow beards as a sign of their commitment to Christ and to show humility. Saint Paul, one of the early Christian leaders, was also depicted with a beard, which indicates that there might be some significance to having a beard in early Christianity. 2. Islam: Growing a beard is considered a sunnah, or practice, of the Prophet Muhammad. Many devout Muslim men grow beards as a sign of piety and religious adherence. 3. Judaism: In some sects of Judaism, beards are considered to be a symbol of wisdom and maturity. Torah scholars and rabbis often have beards, which signifies their knowledge of the sacred texts. Step 2: Summarize findings about religious symbolism of bearded men. In summary, bearded men in various religions and traditions symbolize wisdom, spiritual strength, religious devotion, or maturity. However, there may be variations within sects and denominations of each religion regarding the importance of having a beard. To address the second question about the attractiveness of men with beards, I will examine some studies and viewpoints on the subject. Step 1: Research about the perception of attractiveness for men with and without beards. Studies on attractiveness and beards have shown mixed results, with some suggesting that bearded men are considered to be more attractive, while others claim that clean-shaven men are perceived as more attractive. 1. A study conducted by Barnaby Dixson and Robert Brooks found that women rated men with heavy stubble and full beards as more attractive than clean-shaven men, but men with light stubble were rated as less attractive than both groups. 2. Another study by Neave and Shields found that women rated men with light stubble as more attractive than both clean-shaven and fully bearded men. These studies indicate that preferences for bearded vs. clean-shaven men may vary, and attractiveness might depend on factors such as facial hair length, grooming, and cultural preferences. Step 2: Summarize findings about the attractiveness of men with and without beards. In conclusion, the perception of attractiveness in men with beards varies, and it depends on various factors such as facial hair length, grooming, and cultural preferences. Some studies suggest that bearded men are considered more attractive, while others find clean-shaven men to be more appealing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the solution? Solve 69*m + 35*m = -30*m - 670 for m.","completion":"Alright, let's break this down so that it is easy to understand. We have an equation: 69*m + 35*m = -30*m - 670 First, let's add the \\"m\\" terms (the numbers with \\"m\\" beside them) on the left side of the equation together. So, we have: (69 + 35) * m = 104*m Now our equation looks like this: 104*m = -30*m - 670 To solve for m, we need to get all the \\"m\\" terms on one side of the equation. Let's move the -30*m from the right side to the left side by adding 30*m to both sides of the equation. We have: 104*m + 30*m = -670 Now, let's add the \\"m\\" terms on the left side together. So, we have: (104 + 30) * m = 134*m Our equation is now: 134*m = -670 Now, to find the value of m, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 134: m = -670 / 134 When we divide -670 by 134, we get: m = -5 So, the value of m that solves the equation is -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: Is there any setting in WhatsApp where you can remove yourself from others' WhatsApp list? Answer: No, there isn't any specific setting in WhatsApp that allows you to remove yourself from others' WhatsApp contact list directly. However, you can take a couple of measures to decrease your visibility or make it difficult for others to add you in their contact list. 1. Change your privacy settings: You can change your privacy settings in WhatsApp to hide your profile photo, last seen, status, and live location. To do this, follow these steps: a. Open WhatsApp and go to Settings. b. Tap on Account, then Privacy. c. Change the settings for Last Seen, Profile Photo, About, and Live Location to 'My Contacts' or 'Nobody' as per your preference. 2. Remove your phone number from unwanted contacts: If you want a specific person to not have your number in their contact list, you can ask them to remove your number. However, you have no direct control over this. Second question: I can see a contacts display picture on WhatsApp, but I can't see their status or last seen. Have I just been removed from her contact list, or has she blocked me? Answer: If you can see a contact's display picture but not their status or last seen, there are several possible explanations: 1. The person may have changed their privacy settings: It is possible that the person has updated their privacy settings to hide their last seen or status from anyone or just from you. If they have set it to 'My Contacts', and you're not saved as a contact in their phone, you won't be able to see these details. 2. They have removed you from their contact list: If the person has removed you from their contact list, and their last seen or status settings are set to 'My Contacts', you won't be able to view their status or last seen. 3. Network/server issues: Rarely, there might be a temporary glitch or issue with WhatsApp servers, causing delayed updates in the status or last seen information. This issue usually resolves by itself. If you can see their display picture, it is less likely that they have blocked you on WhatsApp, as when someone blocks you, their display picture, status, and last seen will all be hidden from your view. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Answer: No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is about settings in WhatsApp that allow you to remove yourself from other people's contact lists, while the second question is about determining if you have been removed from a contact list or blocked based on the visibility of a contact's display picture, status, and last seen. While both questions involve understanding privacy features of WhatsApp and contact visibility, they focus on different aspects of the app's functionality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For example, you may write a novella about loss by having a main character who deals with loss in their life. To continue, the next steps in writing a novella would include: 1. Develop your characters: Create compelling and relatable characters that will resonate with readers. Give them distinct personalities, backgrounds, and motivations. These characters will help bring your theme to life and allow the reader to emotionally connect with the story. 2. Create a captivating setting: The setting of your novella should enhance the theme and contribute to the overall tone and atmosphere of the story. Consider whether the setting will be a real location or a fictional one, and strive for vivid descriptions to immerse the reader in the environment. 3. Construct a strong plot: Design a plot that revolves around your chosen theme and allows the characters to grow and change. The plot of a novella is typically more focused and streamlined than that of a novel, so ensure that every event serves a purpose and contributes to the progression of the story. 4. Use engaging writing style and voice: The way you tell your story is just as important as the story itself. Develop a unique voice and writing style that complements your theme and characters. Use descriptive language and varied sentence structures to maintain reader interest. 5. Edit and revise: Once you've finished writing your novella, take the time to carefully review and revise your work. Pay attention to the flow of the story, the pacing, and whether your theme is well-developed. Make sure your characters are consistent, and consider asking for feedback from beta readers to gain valuable insights. By focusing on these steps, you can create a powerful novella that explores your chosen theme and leaves a lasting impact on readers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Bills began their 2007 campaign at home against the Denver Broncos. In the first quarter, the Bills struck first with WR/PR Roscoe Parrish returning a punt 74 yards for a touchdown. Then, near the end of the period, the Broncos got on the board with kicker Jason Elam getting a 21-yard field goal. Denver would go on to get the only score of the second quarter, as Elam kicked a 48-yard field goal. On the opening kickoff for the second half, a scary injury occurred to Bills TE Kevin Everett, as he suffered a cervical spine injury. He would end up being carted off the field, and was rushed to Millard Fillmore Gates Hospital for an emergency surgery. It was due to the fastest application of cold ever applied to an injured spine that gave Everett a chance to walk again despite the initial grim prognosis. In the third quarter, Buffalo struck again as rookie RB Marshawn Lynch got a 23-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Broncos pulled within two as QB Jay Cutler completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall (followed by a failed 2-Point Conversion). Near the end of the fourth quarter, Cutler drove his team into field goal range and with no timeouts left, Denver's special teams came on and Elam kicked the game-winning 42-yard field goal with no time left on the clock. With the shocking loss, the Bills began the season at 0-1.
