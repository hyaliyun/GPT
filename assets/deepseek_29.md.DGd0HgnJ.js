You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: The device in the circuit in Figure above is an ammeter. It measures the current that flows through the wire. The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If more turns were added to the coil, this would increase the strength of the magnetic field as well. If the magnet were moved back and forth repeatedly, the current would keep changing direction. In other words, alternating current would be produced. This is illustrated in Figure below . and the situation: James is testing the strength of electromagnetic fields. He takes two lengths of copper wire and coils them. His first coil, A, has a weaker magnetic field than his second coil, B. Answer the following question: Which coil has a stronger electromagnetic field, A or B?","completion":"Based on the provided information, coil B has a stronger electromagnetic field than coil A. To understand this conclusion, let's break down the factors that contribute to the strength of an electromagnetic field in a coil. 1. Number of turns: The strength of the magnetic field generated by a coil increases as the number of turns in the coil increases. This is because each turn contributes to the total magnetic field, and their fields add up cumulatively. In the given scenario, although the number of turns in coils A and B isn't explicitly mentioned, one can infer that coil B has more turns than coil A, given that coil B produces a stronger magnetic field. 2. Current: The strength of the magnetic field is also proportional to the current passing through the wire. The higher the current, the stronger the magnetic field will be. The description mentions that the device in the circuit is an ammeter, which measures the amount of current flowing through the wire due to the movement of the magnet or coil. Since coil B generates a more substantial magnetic field, it implies that a larger current is flowing through coil B than coil A. 3. Relative motion between magnet and coil: The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current produced, which in turn leads to a stronger magnetic field. While the problem description doesn't explicitly mention the motion in coils A and B, we can presume that for comparison's sake, both coils are subjected to similar motions. Therefore, the difference in their magnetic fields comes down to the other factors mentioned above. 4. Alternating current: The passage mentions that if the magnet is moved back and forth repeatedly within the coil, alternating current will be produced. This phenomenon doesn't have a direct impact on comparing the electromagnetic strength of the two coils. However, it's mentioned to illustrate the relationship between the movement of the magnet, the coil, and the resulting current. In conclusion, out of the two coils James is testing, coil B has a more robust electromagnetic field than coil A, primarily due to the likely higher number of turns and a larger current flowing through the wire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Moreover, Father Thomas is a left-wing radical and an outspoken proponent of Liberation Theology, leading him to constant clashes and bickering with the Bishopâwho nevertheless appreciates his abilities. While the young protagonist's personal traditional conservatism and religious beliefs are offended by the older priest's blatant disregard for his vow of celibacy, he struggles with his own homosexual urges, especially after he meets Graham at a local gay hangout and the two embark on a physical relationship. Meanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she was sexually abused by her father, who confirms her story. Both have revealed their secret in the confessional, however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance and not reveal what he has been told. He tries to warn her mother to keep a close watch on her, but the naive woman believes her daughter is safe while in the care of her husband. When Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car. When he pleads guilty to the charge, the story is headlined on the front page of the local newspaper and, unable to face his parishioners, Father Greg relocates to a remote rural parish headed by a disapproving and unforgiving priest. Father Matthew convinces him to return to St. Mary's, and the two preside over a Mass that is disrupted by the loud protests of those opposed to Father Greg's presence on the altar.

Pick your answer from: + no + yes","completion":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. They are related in that they both deal with concerns about romantic relationships but are asking different things and seeking different types of advice. The first question, \\"What is the point in being a relationship it won't last?\\" is a more general question regarding the purpose and value of engaging in a romantic relationship that the person believes will not last. This question raises concerns about short-term relationships and their potential benefits and drawbacks. On the other hand, the second question is more specific and personal: \\"I think I love my classmate but having a romantic relationship with a schoolmate tops both of our lists of don'ts. (We won't change our school as it is the best one in town.) What should I do?\\" This question pertains to the individual's situation where they have feelings for a classmate but fear that having a romantic relationship with them might be against both of their principles, and they do not want to change schools. In response to the first question, it is essential to note that while some may argue that a relationship with an inevitable end may not be worth pursuing, others might contend that there is still value in the experience and growth that can occur during the relationship. Each individual must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks and determine whether they believe the experience is worthwhile. As for the second question, you may want to consider the following advice: 1. Evaluate the strength of your feelings: It is essential to determine if your attraction to your classmate is genuine love or just a fleeting infatuation. This can help you decide whether pursuing a relationship is worth it in the long run. 2. Engage in open and honest communication: If you believe your feelings for your classmate are genuine, have an open dialogue with them about your attraction. Discuss the reasons you both have listed romantic relationships with schoolmates as a \\"do not\\" and be honest with each other about your concerns, expectations, and priorities. 3. Explore alternative options: You could consider maintaining a friendship or finding support in a platonic relationship while still respecting both of your lists of \\"don'ts.\\" 4. Evaluate the consequences: Think about the potential repercussions of pursuing a relationship, such as potential impact on your school performance, friendships, and potential fallout in case of a breakup. Make sure both you and your classmate are willing to accept the potential outcomes. 5. Make a mutual decision: Ultimately, the decision to pursue a romantic relationship should be a mutual one based on open communication, trust, and understanding. If you both agree that the potential drawbacks outweigh the benefits, it may be best to maintain a friendship and focus on your education. In summary, both questions are about relationships, but they do not have the same meaning. The first question considers the value of a relationship that will not last, while the second is a specific question about navigating a potential romantic relationship with a classmate while adhering to personal principles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: There were two villages: Berg village situated at 3000 ft, at the base of the mountain, and Steep village, situated at 8500 feet. People visiting the area always stop in Berg village and feel great, but they feel bad and winded once they get to Steep village. Which village has a lower oxygen content in the air? Hint: Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7] At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8] The answer is:","completion":"Steep village has a lower oxygen content in the air. As the hint suggests, high altitude regions are those that are significantly above mean sea level, and they generally begin at about 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level. In high altitude areas, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to the combined effects of gravity, which causes air to be closer to the ground, and the heat content of the air, which causes air molecules to bounce off each other and expand. Berg village is situated at 3000 ft (approximately 914 meters), which is not considered high altitude and thus, the atmospheric pressure is higher than in Steep village. Steep village is situated at 8500 ft (approximately 2591 meters), which falls into the high altitude category, and therefore has a lower atmospheric pressure. Oxygen content in the air is directly related to atmospheric pressure. In regions with lower atmospheric pressure, there is less oxygen available, making it more difficult for people to breathe.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I’ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

Write some highlights for the following article: A New York taxi driver pleaded guilty Friday to involvement in a plot to blow up crowded subway trains. After entering his plea Zarein Ahmedzay delivered a message: \\"I strongly urge the American people to stop supporting the war against Islam,\\" he said, adding, \\"I am thankful for myself that I did not do anything to harm anyone but fear someone else will do the same thing.\\" Prosecutors said Ahmedzay and another man, Adis Medunjanin, conspired with Najibullah Zazi on the attack in mid-September 2009, which authorities thwarted. Zazi pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with authorities, investigators have said. Medunjanin has pleaded not guilty. During Ahmedzay's hearing, prosecutors for the first time revealed the names of the two al Qaeda leaders who, officials said, ordered the plot: Saleh al-Somali, head of international operations for al Qaeda, and Rashid Rauf, a key operative. U.S. officials said both al Qaeda figures were killed in drone in attacks in Waziristan, the tribal region along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Rauf was reported killed in a drone attack in Waziristan in November 2008; al-Somali was reported killed in December 2009, U.S. officials said. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, in a written statement, said the facts disclosed Friday \\"add chilling details to what we know was a deadly plot hatched by al Qaeda leaders overseas to kill scores of Americans in the New York City subway system in September 2009. This plot, as well as others we have encountered, makes clear we face a continued threat from al Qaeda and its affiliates overseas.\\" \\"Prosecution underscores the importance of using every tool we have available to both disrupt plots against our nation and hold suspected terrorists accountable,\\" Holder said. Ahmedzay previously pleaded not guilty to making false statements to the FBI about the plot. But Friday, appearing before before Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Steven M. Gold in U.S. District Court, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to use a weapon of mass of destruction against people in the United States; conspiracy to commit murder; and providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Ahmedzay told the court that he, Zazi and a third man traveled to Pakistan in August 2008 to join jihadists fighting in Afghanistan, but they were turned away. But al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan told the group they would be more helpful to the jihad cause if they conducted suicide attacks in New York. \\"We discussed the matter amongst ourselves, and we agreed to go forward with the plan,\\" he said. \\"I personally believed that conducting an operation in the United States would be the best way to end the wars.\\" At one point, Ahmedzay said, he began to have second thoughts but ultimately committed to the plan. He said his primary input was to develop targets because he was a taxi driver and knew the city well. Eventually, the three settled on an attack on subway trains during the month of Ramadan, but abandoned that plan when they believed law enforcement was watching them. Ahmedzay concluded his statement to the court with his belief that \\"Zionist Jews\\" are \\"the real enemies of this country\\" who are \\"destroying this country from within\\" and \\"want a permanent shadow government within the government of the United States.\\" He faces a sentence of up to life in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced at the end of July. \\"Ahmedzay's plea makes clear that he betrayed his adopted country and its people by providing support to al Qaeda and planning to bring deadly violence to New York,\\" said FBI Director Robert S. Mueller in a written statement. Robert Gottlieb, attorney for Medunjanin, said Friday's developments do not change his client's plans to proceed to trial. \\"The evidence and the facts as they pertain to him will come out in court,\\" Gottlieb said. No trial date has been set for Medunjanin.

Answer the following question: Process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person does a lot of exercise happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"When a person engages in exercise, the body's demand for oxygen increases as the muscles require more energy to function properly. The perturbation hypothesis you proposed considers a scenario where a smaller amount of oxygen is delivered to the bloodstream during exercise. This situation could indeed have direct and indirect effects on the overall process. Direct effects: 1. Decreased oxygen supply: If the amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream is reduced, it may not be sufficient to meet the increased demand of the body during exercise. This can lead to a state of oxygen deprivation or hypoxia, thereby negatively affecting the body's ability to produce energy through aerobic respiration. 2. Increased anaerobic respiration: When the oxygen supply is limited, the body may resort to anaerobic respiration to produce energy. This process is less efficient and can lead to the buildup of lactic acid in the body, causing muscle fatigue, soreness, and impaired exercise performance. 3. Reduced cardiovascular efficiency: The cardiovascular system typically responds to the increased demand for oxygen during exercise by increasing the heart rate, stroke volume, and blood pressure. However, if the oxygen supply is limited, the cardiovascular system may struggle to deliver adequate blood flow and oxygen to the working muscles, leading to diminished exercise performance. Indirect effects: 1. Decreased exercise duration and intensity: Due to the limited oxygen supply, a person may find it difficult to sustain high-intensity exercise for a long duration. This could result in a reduced caloric expenditure and slower progress towards exercise goals. 2. Adaptation or compensation mechanisms: As a response to chronic exercise with reduced oxygen supply, the body may undergo various adaptations in an attempt to compensate for the limitation. For instance, the number of red blood cells or blood vessels supplying the muscles may increase to enhance the capacity to transport and utilize oxygen. These adaptive responses may partially mitigate the negative impacts of reduced oxygen delivery on exercise performance. In conclusion, limiting oxygen delivered to the bloodstream during exercise has both direct and indirect effects on the overall process. The body's ability to generate energy, maintain cardiovascular efficiency, and adapt to these circumstances may influence the extent to which the perturbation impacts exercise performance and physiological outcomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Soon after, George is struck blind when he enters a previously unexplored tomb. Upon their return in New York City, George is informed that the loss of his eyesight will only be temporary. Susie begins to act strangely, and her younger brother Tommy (Giovanni Frezza), who stayed behind in New York with the family's au pair Jamie Lee (Cinzia de Ponti), is also affected by the mysterious amulet. Both Susie and Tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. A few days later, George's eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he'd entered to a colleague called Wiler. A little while later, Luke Anderson (Carlo De Mejo), an eccentric colleague of Emily's, arrives to work with her on her latest story detailing her travels in Egypt. When Luke hears a noise coming from Susie's bedroom, he goes in, only to be sucked into the dimensional portal and finds himself transported to the deserts of Egypt where he later dies from dehydration in the vast, arid desert. The Hackers think Luke's disappearance is merely a practical joke, but they never learn of his fate, nor find any trace of him. Jamie Lee takes the kids out to nearby Central Park to play where she takes photos of them. A woman picks up a discarded Polaroid photo taken of Susie. It shows nothing but the amulet against the grassy background. The woman contacts a man called Adrian Marcato (Laurence Welles) with her find.

Please answer the following question: Question: Where can I ride my bicycle in order to take graduate classes? Options: - bike path - schoolyard - netherlands - street - university Explain why a human would choose \\"university\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"university\\" as the correct option to answer the question \\"Where can I ride my bicycle in order to take graduate classes?\\" for several reasons. Firstly, the fundamental purpose of attending a university is to pursue higher education, including graduate-level classes. Universities typically offer a wide range of degree programs, including undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate studies. They are designed to provide students with the necessary knowledge and skills to excel in their chosen fields and often employ renowned professors, researchers, and experts to teach these courses. So, if someone is specifically looking to take graduate classes, the university would be the natural and primary setting where they could access and enroll in these classes. Secondly, universities often provide extensive facilities, resources, and services aimed at supporting students in their academic journey. These include libraries, lecture halls, laboratories, research centers, study rooms, and tutoring services, to name just a few. Enrolling in a graduate program at a university enables students to fully utilize these resources to optimize their studies and academic success. Thirdly, universities help foster a stimulating and enriching educational environment that encourages intellectual growth, critical thinking, and collaborative learning. By attending graduate classes at a university, students have the opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals, build networks, and exchange ideas that can be invaluable for their personal and professional growth. Now, let's briefly consider the other options: 1. Bike path: While a bike path might provide a scenic ride or an enjoyable exercise route, it does not have any direct connection to graduate classes or higher education. Riding one's bicycle on a bike path would not lead to taking graduate classes. 2. Schoolyard: A schoolyard typically refers to an open space or playground attached to a school, often meant for children or teenagers during recess or physical education classes. It is not an appropriate or relevant place for someone to attend graduate classes. 3. Netherlands: As a country, the Netherlands does have several reputable universities that offer graduate programs. However, merely riding a bicycle to the Netherlands without specifying which university one intends to attend will not allow a person to take graduate classes. 4. Street: Similar to a bike path, riding a bicycle on the street is not directly related to attending graduate classes. Streets are primarily utilized for transportation and, while they might lead to a university campus, they are not the ideal answer to the question. In conclusion, among the given options, \\"university\\" is the most accurate and logical answer for where someone can ride their bicycle in order to take graduate classes because universities are specifically designed for higher education, provide the necessary resources and environment for academic success, and offer a plethora of graduate programs to choose from."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do these questions have the same meaning? How do I know if someone has blocked me on WeChat? How can you tell if you've been blocked on Facebook Messenger?","completion":"While these questions may seem similar due to their focus on communication platforms and the blocking feature, they are asking about two distinct applications, WeChat and Facebook Messenger, and are not exactly the same. They ask about similar functionality in each respective app, but the answers are tailored specifically to each application, and the processes and indications of being blocked might vary between the two platforms. The first question is asking, \\"How do I know if someone has blocked me on WeChat?\\" This centers on WeChat, which is a popular Chinese messaging app used for messaging, calling, and social media. Here is a detailed answer for this question: 1. Check their Moments: WeChat Moments is a feature that works similarly to Facebook's timeline. If you cannot see any new posts from that person or their existing posts have disappeared, it could be an indication that they have blocked you. 2. Send a message: If you send a message and it remains stuck at \\"Sent\\" instead of changing to \\"Delivered,\\" it might be a sign that you have been blocked by the user. 3. Search for the user: If you try searching for the person's name, and you can't find them in the search results, they may have blocked you. 4. WeChat Sticker Shop: Visit the WeChat Sticker Shop and choose any set of free stickers. If there's an option to \\"Gift\\" the stickers to someone, search for the person in question. If they are not listed, it could mean they have blocked you. Please note, though, that these observations could be due to other reasons, such as a deactivated account, privacy settings, or network issues. It is important to consider these alternative explanations before concluding that you have been blocked. The second question is asking, \\"How can you tell if you've been blocked on Facebook Messenger?\\" This question is about Facebook Messenger and has a completely separate set of variables and signs to consider. Here is a detailed answer for this question: 1. Check for the contact’s profile picture and “Last Active” status: If you can no longer see the profile picture or the \\"Last Active\\" status of the person you suspect has blocked you, this could be an indication of being blocked. 2. Send a message: If your message doesn't get delivered, and you only see a gray checkmark (indicating \\"Sent\\"), it could mean that you have been blocked. This is not always definitive, as it might also indicate network issues or the recipient has turned off their chat feature. 3. Your call won't go through: If you attempt to call the person via Messenger, and it doesn't connect or the call is not answered, it might be a sign that you have been blocked. 4. Mutual group messages: If you share a group message with the person, you can check if you're able to view their messages in the group chat. If you cannot see their messages, it might be an indication they have blocked you. 5. Search for them on Facebook: If you are unable to find them in your friends list or through a Facebook search, it could mean that you have been blocked or they have deleted their account. Again, it is essential to consider alternative explanations such as privacy settings, deactivated accounts, or network issues before concluding that you have been blocked based on these signs. In conclusion, while both questions are about identifying whether you've been blocked on communication platforms, they specifically ask about the signs and methods for two different apps: WeChat and Facebook Messenger. The processes and indications for each application may vary, so it's necessary to treat them as separate queries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Ralph was not much alarmed when Percy Paget went over and disappeared beneath the waters of the lake. He knew the young aristocrat could swim. Moreover, the end of the rowboat was within easy reach. Percy let out one yell, and then went under. The yell was not one of fright over his safety, but over the thought that all of his elegant clothing would be wet through and through. He made a great splashing when he came up, and soon grasped the gunwale of his boat. \\"You rascal!\\" he spluttered. \\"Just wait till I settle with you!\\" \\"It's your own fault that you went overboard,\\" retorted Ralph. \\"I sincerely hope that it cures your fiery temper.\\" \\"Don't talk to me!\\" \\"All right, I won't,\\" and without another word Ralph walked off, leaving Percy to get out of his predicament as best he could. The young aristocrat was fearfully angry when he at last drew himself out of the lake. His hat had floated off, and he was compelled to row away from shore for it. By the time he came back Ralph had disappeared. \\"I'll fix him for that!\\" muttered the young bully, hotly. \\"I'll fix him, see if I don't!\\" It made Percy doubly angry to think that Ralph had been so richly rewarded for stopping the runaway team. Percy thought a good deal of Julia Carrington, and he fondly hoped that the young and beautiful girl regarded him with equal favor. He would have been disagreeably surprised had he known the exact truth. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. who was not surprised? 2. about what? 3. was he able to swim? 4. did he yell? 5. was he drowning? 6. why was he yelling? 7. what kind of clothes were they? 8. did he go under water? 9. what did he grab onto? 10. what did he say? 11. who was he mad at? 12. why?","completion":"1.

Explanation: The word \\"nightmare\\" generally means a scary or an upsetting dream. When we talk about a \\"nightmare\\", we usually mean something very unpleasant. So when we say \\"the nightmare of war\\", we're saying that war is very, very bad. That's why it's negative. On the other hand, positive means good or happy, but war is definitely not good or happy. Therefore, this sentence cannot be positive. It's a bit like saying a monster is actually a nice friend - sounds crazy, right?

Craig is more successful than Joseph due to the negative mindset that","completion":"Joseph has adopted. Joseph's negative mindset is a major barrier to his success and has consistently held him back from realizing his true potential. In comparison, Craig has fostered a positive and growth-oriented mindset, which allows him to excel and achieve greater successes. Step 1: Analyzing the situation In order to understand why Craig is more successful than Joseph, it's essential to consider their attitudes and beliefs about themselves and their capabilities. It's evident that Joseph's negative mindset makes it difficult for him to believe in his own success, whereas Craig's positive mindset opens up opportunities and encourages him to take risks. Step 2: Identifying reasons for Joseph's negative mindset There could be numerous reasons for Joseph's negative mindset, such as past failures, lack of support from family and friends, fear of success, or even low self-esteem. In any case, it's crucial for Joseph to become aware of these factors to begin making positive changes. Step 3: Highlighting Craig's positive mindset Craig's success is greatly attributed to his positive mindset. He believes in his own abilities, sets realistic and achievable goals, and approaches challenges with enthusiasm and persistence. By maintaining this kind of mindset, Craig not only increases his chances of success but also experiences personal growth. Step 4: Suggesting ways to shift from a negative to a positive mindset In order for Joseph to shift from a negative mindset to a positive one, he must identify the root causes of his negativity, develop a growth mindset, and embrace new experiences and opportunities. Additionally, seeking help from a therapist or life coach could prove beneficial in changing his way of thinking. Step 5: Evaluating the impact of a positive mindset on success As Joseph works on shifting his mindset and maintaining a positive attitude, he will likely notice improvements in his overall success and well-being. It's important for him to recognize that although external factors play a role in success, mindset is a crucial element that should not be overlooked. In conclusion, adopting a positive mindset is vital for achieving success and unlocking one's full potential. While both Craig and Joseph may have similar skills and opportunities, it's ultimately their mindset that sets them apart. With persistence and self-awareness, Joseph can work on changing his mindset and become more successful like Craig."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Acornsoft was the software arm of Acorn Computers, and a major publisher of software for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron. As well as games, it also produced a large number of educational titles, extra computer languages and business and utility packages these included word processor \\"VIEW\\" and the spreadsheet \\"ViewSheet\\" supplied on ROM and cartridge for the BBC Micro/Acorn Electron and included as standard in the BBC Master and Acorn Business Computer. - Professor Peter D. Killworth (27 March 1946 28 January 2008) was an English scientist known for both his work on oceanography and the study of social networks. A prolific writer, he published more than 160 scientific papers over the course of his career. He was also known for his work as a pioneering author of text interactive fiction games during the early 1980s. - BBC BASIC is a programming language, developed in 1981 as a native programming language for the MOS Technology 6502 based Acorn BBC Micro home/personal computer, mainly by Sophie Wilson. It is a version of the BASIC programming language adapted for a UK computer literacy project of the BBC. - The Acorn Electron is a budget version of the BBC Micro educational/home computer made by Acorn Computers Ltd. It has 32 kilobytes of RAM, and its ROM includes BBC BASIC v2 along with its operating system. - Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives, either in the form of Interactive narratives or Interactive narrations. These works can also be understood as a form of video game, either in the form of an adventure game or role-playing game. In common usage, the term refers to text adventures, a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be \\"text-only\\", however, Graphical text adventure games, where the text is accompanied by graphics (still images, animations or video) still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text. Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction, known as \\"Puzzle-free\\", that focuses on narrative, and \\"text adventures\\" that focus on puzzles. - Countdown to Doom is a text adventure computer game, more recently termed interactive fiction, written in 1982 by Peter Killworth. Its setting is the planet Doomawangara, which is coyly said to be shortened to \\"Doom\\". There are two sequels, \\"Return to Doom\\" and \\"Last Days of Doom\\". - Acorn Computers Ltd. was a British computer company established in Cambridge, England, in 1978. The company produced a number of computers which were especially popular in the UK, including the Acorn Electron and the Acorn Archimedes. Acorn's BBC Micro computer dominated the UK educational computer market during the 1980s. It is more known for its computer than for its other products. - The Acorn Archimedes is a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge, England and sold in the late-1980s to mid-1990s, their first general purpose home computer based on their own ARM architecture (then the CPU and architecture was known as Acorn RISC Machine, or ARM, that later became one of the most widely used CPU architectures in the world, e.g. used in most smartphones). The first Archimedes was launched in 1987. - The kilobyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The International System of Units (SI) defines the prefix \\"kilo\\" as 1000 (10); therefore one kilobyte is 1000 bytes. The unit symbol for the kilobyte is kB. In information technology, particularly in reference to main memory capacity, \\"kilobyte\\" is traditionally used to denote 1024 (2) bytes. This arises from the powers-of-two sizing common to such memory in digital circuitry. In this context, the symbols K and KB are often used when 1024 bytes is meant. - Oceanography (compound of the Greek words meaning \\"ocean\\" and meaning \\"write\\"), also known as oceanology, is the study of the physical and the biological aspects of the ocean. It is an Earth science covering a wide range of topics, including ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within: astronomy, biology, chemistry, climatology, geography, geology, hydrology, meteorology and physics. Paleoceanography studies the history of the oceans in the geologic past. - Castle of Riddles is a text adventure released by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro ( in 1982 ) and Acorn Electron ( 1984 ) home computers . The game was written by Peter Killworth and was one of a series of text adventures written for , or ported to the BBC Micro by the same author ( others including Countdown to Doom and Philosopher 's Quest ) . As with all such games , only text is used . The player must use a simple ' verb - noun ' format ( e.g. ' Go North ' , ' Get lamp ' ) to control the game . Unlike Killworth 's other Acornsoft adventures , Castle of Riddles was not updated and reissued by Topologika so became unavailable after 1985 when Acorn Computers ( parent company of Acornsoft ) pulled out of the games publishing market . Some of the puzzles however were included in the Topologika version of Philosopher 's Quest . - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Topologika Software Ltd was an independent British publisher of educational software. Established in Stilton, Cambridgeshire in 1983, the company spent most of its life in Penryn, Cornwall before moving to Brighton, Sussex. The company was dissolved at the end of June 2013. Its educational software continues to be sold by distributors REM via , and is still supported by Topologika's founder Brian Kerslake. - The BBC Microcomputer System, or BBC Micro, is a series of microcomputers and associated peripherals designed and built by the Acorn Computer company for the \\"BBC Computer Literacy Project\\", operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Designed with an emphasis on education, it was notable for its ruggedness, expandability, and the quality of its operating system. An accompanying 1982 television series \\"\\"The Computer Programme\\"\\" featuring Chris Serle learning to use the machine was also broadcast on BBC 2. - The Acorn Business Computer (ABC) was a series of microcomputers announced at the end of 1983 by the British company Acorn Computers. The series of eight computers was aimed at the business, research and further education markets. However, the ABC range was cancelled before any of the models were shipped to customers. The ABC 210 was subsequently relaunched as the Acorn Cambridge Workstation, sold in modest numbers to academic and scientific users.

Real Madrid continued their 100 per cent start to this season's Champions League with a one-sided victory at Liverpool on Wednesday night. Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and a Karim Benzema double gave the current tournament holders a 3-0 lead at half-time which they didn't look back from. For Liverpool, the result was a nightmare which saw £16million summer signing Mario Balotelli substituted at half-time after a dire performance. Here, Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell gives his verdict on how the players performed. Liverpool (4-3-3) Simon Mignolet - 5.5 Failed to convince when coming for crosses and found himself embarrassed by Pepe’s prod for Benzema’s second. Atoned somewhat with super save when one-on-one with Ronaldo. Errantly tried to shepherd the ball back to","completion":"his goal-line without considering Ronaldo's speed and determination, leaving him exposed and struggling to regain his composure. Needs to show more assertiveness and command of his area going forward. Alberto Moreno - 4.5 Unable to contain the threat of Real Madrid's right side and struggled to maintain his defensive responsibilities while trying to push forward. Outshone by Ronaldo and Bale throughout the game, it was a difficult night for the young fullback. Martin Skrtel - 6 On a miserable night for Liverpool's backline, Skrtel put in a commendable shift against some of the toughest attacking talents in world football. Made some vital interceptions and clearances, but was overwhelmed by Real Madrid's relentless pressure. Dejan Lovren - 5 Failed to live up to his price-tag and still seems to be struggling to adapt to Liverpool's defensive setup. Seemed off the pace and displayed weak positioning that allowed Benzema to capitalise for his goals. Has to improve if he's to prove his worth at Anfield. Glen Johnson - 4 A torrid evening for the right-back who struggled to contain Marcelo and Isco on Real Madrid's left flank. Erratic defensive decision-making and lack of contribution in attack showed that the experienced Johnson is far from his best. Steven Gerrard - 6.5 Despite the overwhelming odds against his side, Gerrard never stopped trying to drive his team forward. Some dangerous set-pieces and passing accuracy were a standout, but even his tenacity and leadership couldn't spark a comeback. Jordan Henderson - 5.5 Put in a tireless display, but couldn't quite execute on the night. Found it hard to keep up with the pace and quality of Real Madrid's midfield, rendering his impact minimal in this contest. Joe Allen - 5 A rather unremarkable showing from the Welshman. Didn't offer a significant input in either attack or defense, and was consistently outplayed by the opposition's midfield. Raheem Sterling - 6.5 Despite the Liverpool attack falling flat against a solid Real Madrid defense, Sterling continued to be a threat on the wing and had a few promising runs. However, his final product and decision-making lacked conviction, ultimately leading to few clear-cut chances. Mario Balotelli - 3.5 A dire performance from the Italian striker led to his substitution at half-time. Unable to make an impact in the final third, Balotelli's lackluster effort level and perceived disinterest led to a justified early exit. Philippe Coutinho - 6 While he showed flashes of skill, creativity, and vision, Coutinho struggled to find space in a congested midfield battleground. He was unable to provide the link-up play needed to make a difference on the scoreline. Substitutes: Adam Lallana (replaced Balotelli) - 6.5 Brought energy and creativity to Liverpool's lifeless attack but lacked the cutting edge required to pierce Real Madrid's defense. Rickie Lambert (replaced Coutinho) - 5 Worked hard but never got the service needed to make an impact in the few minutes he was on the pitch. Emre Can (replaced Allen) - 5.5 Provided fresh legs and tried to link up with the attack, but the game was well beyond Liverpool's reach by the time he was introduced. Real Madrid domination left many Liverpool players exposed and unable to make their mark on the game, highlighting the gulf in class between the two sides. For Liverpool, it's time to go back to the drawing board and figure out how to rediscover the form and flair that led them to Champions League football once again."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Este scump să devenim \\"verzi”, iar eforturile necesare restructurării fundamentale a multor sectoare în vederea atingerii scopurilor ambiţioase sunt colosale. Translate this to English?","completion":"\\"It is expensive to become 'green', and the efforts required for the fundamental restructuring of many sectors to achieve ambitious goals are colossal.\\" In recent years, the concept of becoming \\"green\\" or adopting environmentally friendly practices has been increasingly emphasized as a crucial strategy for combating climate change and promoting sustainable living. The term \\"green\\" here refers to a low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially inclusive approach to development. While the concept is highly desirable, it often comes with significant costs and challenges that need to be addressed. Firstly, transitioning to a green economy requires substantial financial investments in new technologies, infrastructure, and industries, such as renewable energy, electric transportation, green buildings, and waste management. These investments may be daunting for governments, businesses, and individuals alike, as they require a considerable amount of capital and the willingness to take on risk. Additionally, the shift to a greener economy often necessitates significant policy changes and regulatory reforms. Policymakers need to implement stringent environmental regulations, enforce strict emission standards, and provide incentives for businesses and consumers to adopt green technologies. These changes may be politically challenging, as they may not receive the support of various stakeholders. There is also the issue of job displacement. As industries transition from traditional, fossil fuel-based models to more sustainable practices, many workers may face unemployment or the need for retraining and reskilling. Governments and businesses must invest in workforce development programs to equip people with the right skills and knowledge to fill the jobs created in new green sectors. Moreover, becoming green involves a fundamental transformation of social norms and values, which often takes time and effort. Encouraging people to adopt environmentally friendly lifestyles, such as reducing waste, recycling, and conserving energy, requires a shift in their attitudes and behavior. This necessitates significant investment in public awareness campaigns, educational initiatives, and community engagement. Lastly, there is the challenge of global coordination and cooperation. Climate change is a global issue that requires collective action from countries worldwide. International cooperation and agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, are essential for promoting the sharing of best practices, policy coordination, and technology transfer. However, political differences and economic disparities between countries may hinder the global pursuit of a green future. In conclusion, while it is true that becoming green may come with considerable costs and challenges, the urgent need to address climate change and transition towards sustainable development demands that societies make this transformation. Any investment made towards this end will not only improve environmental quality but also benefit human well-being and the economy in the long term. The road towards a green future may be arduous, but it is a necessary one to ensure the planet's survival for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"Programs develop more opportunities for staff to understand the discriminatory impact on clients that can result from public policies.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Programs develop opportunities to help understand the impact of discrimination. \\" is true?","completion":"Yes, based on the premise \\"Programs develop more opportunities for staff to understand the discriminatory impact on clients that can result from public policies.\\", we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Programs develop opportunities to help understand the impact of discrimination.\\" is true. To support this conclusion, let's analyze the elements of the premise and the hypothesis. 1. Programs: The term 'programs' refers to organized activities, initiatives, workshops, or training sessions designed to achieve specific goals or objectives. In this context, the programs aim to develop more opportunities for staff members to enhance their knowledge and understanding of discrimination and its effects. 2. Discriminatory Impact: This term encompasses the unequal and unjust treatment or consequences suffered by certain individuals or groups due to public policies. Discrimination can result from biases in policy design, implementation, or enforcement. The discriminatory impact can lead to social, economic, and psychological consequences for the affected individuals or groups. 3. Public Policies: These are actions taken by governments or public authorities to address specific issues, problems, or needs in society. Public policies can be laws, regulations, or programs that guide public organizations' conduct and decision-making. However, at times, these policies may inadvertently or intentionally lead to disadvantageous outcomes for certain sections of society, thereby causing discrimination. Now, let's break down the hypothesis: \\"Programs develop opportunities to help understand the impact of discrimination.\\" Here, the focus is on programs' ability to create opportunities that help in comprehending the discrimination impact. By stating that \\"Programs develop more opportunities for staff to understand the discriminatory impact on clients that can result from public policies,\\" the premise indeed supports this hypothesis. These programs educate and train staff members about the complex interplay of factors that contribute to discrimination and equip them with the skills to recognize and address such biases. Programs can involve activities such as workshops, case studies, simulations, discussions, lectures, and practical training that highlight the discriminatory impact of public policies and foster sensitivity towards people who experience this impact. Furthermore, by creating opportunities for staff to better understand discrimination and its effects, programs ultimately encourage them to make more informed and equitable decisions when designing, implementing, or evaluating public policies. This, in turn, reduces the potential for discrimination and promotes a more just and inclusive society. In summary, the hypothesis \\"Programs develop opportunities to help understand the impact of discrimination\\" is true, supported by the premise which states that programs enable staff to grasp the discriminatory consequences that clients can potentially face due to public policies. These programs play a crucial role in educating and promoting awareness about discrimination and fostering a more inclusive and equitable society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: If you need glasses to read this, you are among most of Chinese students. About four-fifths of high school students in China have poor eyesight . And now more and more children in primary school need glasses, too. Two main reasons can cause poor eyesight: too much time spent indoors studying and too little time spent outdoors playing. Reading and writing for hours and hours, sometimes in poorly lighted rooms, causes eyesight to weaken. But students have to do this because there is so much pressure on them to succeed in school. They have less time to enjoy the sun. The sun, it turns out, is important in developing good eyesight. According to a study by Australian National University, Australian children and Chinese children have the same level of eyesight before they start school, but once they enter primary school, Chinese children only spend about an hour a day outside, while Australian children spend three to four hours each day in the sunshine. The result is that while about forty percent of Chinese primary school students need glasses, only three percent of Australian children do. And poor eyesight at a young age can have serious long term influence. As you get older, your eyesight can worsen. With all that in mind, don't you think it's time to give your eyes a break?

The Hollywood actor is yet another star who has been caught out in an angry rant. Nicolas's meltdown moment occurred outside a nightclub in Romania, after filming his new movie, Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance. Scroll down for video Losing his cool: Nicolas Cage (left) rants and gets into a fight in front of a nightclub in Romanian on Sunday morning Walking away: The Hollywood actor(far right) is shown on the footage breaking away from his group as he continues to rant The 46-year-old father-of-two had been partying with some friends and crew members before he flew off the handle. It was just after 5am on Sunday morning when Cage lost his temper outside the club in Bucharest, Romania. The incident was caught on camera by a passer-by on his mobile phone device. The footage was later broadcast on a local television station. Foul mouth: Nicolas uses profanity whilst screaming at his friends Looking happier: Nicholas Cage in more relaxed mood arriving for an appearance on Letterman in August 'Get in that car and walk away. I'll f*****g die because of honour. I'll f*****g die right now,' screams Nicolas in the video. What set off the multi-million dollar actor's rage is unknown, but in the video it appears that his anger is directed towards a man and two women, who all attempt to calm him down. Nicolas' minders were also forced to step in, trying to move the actor away from the venue. But the group's advice falls on deaf ears, as Nicolas pulls away and screams: 'Don't ouch me you little b****.' Moments later he heads back towards the concerned group, pretending to point two fingers in his own eyes and screaming: 'See my eyes - respect them as you'd respect me.' After a few minutes his bodyguards finally get Nicolas into the car before it speeds away into the night. Nicolas joins fellow Hollywood actor Christian Bale, whose own foul-mouthed angry tirade was also exposed last year. Christian lost his temper on the set of Terminator Salvation, at the film's director of photography, Shane Hurbult. The following year in February the audio recording of the incident was released. On the tape you can hear Christian screaming profanities at Shane, threatening him and belittling him.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How much are the year's returns projected to cover for the income in interest?\\" is \\"It will cover 750,000 and 1 million\\"?","completion":"Yes, that is correct. According to the paragraph, this year's returns are projected to be between 700,000 and 1 million short of the previous year's mark. Since the interest generated on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million last year, the current year's returns would cover the income in interest in the range of 3.5 million to 3.8 million (4.5 million - 1 million or 4.5 million - 700,000)."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: If you’re giving a presentation, always include something physical for your participants to work with. Presentation handouts should summarize what you’ll be saying in your presentation and include additional figures or visuals. Include additional resources in handouts that aren’t in the presentation. For example, if your presentation was about fire safety, include a list of numbers that employees can call to report safety violations. Whether your training program is a manual, a presentation, or another medium, tell participants the goal of the program. That way, they can see how the information they’re about to receive builds up to the ultimate goal of the training. Put this goal on one of the first pages of a manual or handout. Use an explicit statement like, “By the end of this program, you will know how to do … “ If there are multiple goals, break them up into A, B, and C for further clarity. Inform participants of the training plan so they know what to expect. If you’re giving a presentation, put a schedule on the projector or in the handouts you provide. If you’re writing a manual or module, make one of the first pages a table of contents. For long presentations, always schedule a break time. Your participants will zone out in meetings that last several hours. If you have to cover a lot of material, consider multiple sessions over a few days to hold your participants’ attention. If your training program includes multiple goals, keep those goals separate so participants can focus on one skill at a time. If you try to cover different skills in the same section, your program will be messy and hard to follow. Look at all your training goals and if necessary, break them into small sections. This will make your program much easier for participants. Organize different sections logically. For example, don’t make the first section “Interacting with Customers” and the second section “Answering the Phone.” This doesn’t make sense because “Answering the Phone” should come first. Build up to each skill by using an effective order of events. Training materials should be easy to read and refer back to. If you’re putting together a manual, explain everything as simply and quickly as you can. The same goes for handouts. Use bullet points instead of paragraphs wherever possible. If you write in complete sentences, don’t use long paragraphs or blocks of text. Skip a line every few sentences. Breaking up the text will allow the participants to skim the information more easily. If you aren’t good at writing short, simple instructions, consider hiring a professional writer who is. Your training program will be much better and easier to follow. This advice can also apply to presentations. Don’t put large blocks of text on the projector. Use very short, readable sentences and bullet points to keep your audience’s attention. No matter what medium you use for your training materials, use visuals like charts, figures, and diagrams to help guide the participants along. It will make the information easier to follow, but more importantly, people often learn better when they see a visual representation. For a guide explaining how to use the office computers, for instance, include screenshots of each page and circle areas where employees should click. This conveys the point much better than explaining the location of each button.

Question: When is the assault on the Japanese base? Movie plot title: Sands of Iwo Jima Movie plot: Note: the story is told from the viewpoint of Cpl. Robert Dunne (Arthur Franz). Tough-as-nails career Marine Sergeant John Stryker (John Wayne) is greatly disliked by the men of his squad, particularly the combat replacements, for the rigorous training he puts them through. He is especially despised by PFC. Peter \\"Pete\\" Conway (John Agar), the arrogant, college-educated son of an officer, Colonel Sam Conway under whom Stryker served and admired, and PFC. Al Thomas (Forrest Tucker), who blames him for his demotion. When Stryker leads his squad in the invasion of Tarawa, the men begin to appreciate his methods, except Conway, who considers him brutal and unfeeling when he apparently abandons a wounded comrade to the enemy. Within the first couple of minutes of the battle, the platoon leader, Lt. Baker (Gil Herman, is killed only seconds after he lands on the beach, PFC. \\"Farmer\\" Soames (James Holden) is wounded in the leg, and PFC. Choynski (Hal Baylor) receives a head wound. The marines are aggressively pinned down by a pillbox. As a result of three unsuccessful attempts to reach the pillbox, two demolition marines and a flamethrower operator are killed and PFC. Shipley (Richard Webb) is left mortally wounded in the line of fire. Sgt. Stryker takes action and demolishes the pillbox. Shipley would eventually die of his wounds in front of his best friend Regazzi (Wally Cassell).

It consisted of Auschwitz I (the original camp), Auschwitz IIBirkenau (a combination concentration/extermination camp), Auschwitz IIIMonowitz (a labor camp to staff an IG Farben factory), and 45 satellite camps. - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The German extermination camps or death camps were designed and built by Nazi Germany during World War II (193945) to systematically kill millions of Jews, Slavs and others whom the Nazis considered \\"Untermenschen\\", primarily by gassing, but also in mass executions and through extreme work under starvation conditions. - Franciszek Piper ( born 1941 ) is a Polish scholar , historian and author . Most of his work concerns the Holocaust , especially the history of the Auschwitz concentration camp . Dr. Piper is credited as one of the historians who helped establish a more accurate number of victims of Auschwitz - Birkenau death camps . According to his research , at least 1.1 million people perished at Auschwitz - Birkenau , of whom about 960,000 were Jewish . He is the author of several books and chair of the Historical Department at the Auschwitz - Birkenau State Museum . - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Following the Invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II, nearly a quarter of the entire territory of the Second Polish Republic was annexed by Nazi Germany and placed directly under the German civil administration. The rest of Nazi occupied Poland was renamed as the General Government district. The annexation was part of the \\"fourth\\" partition of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, outlined months before the invasion, in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. - Nazi Germany maintained concentration camps (KZ or KL) throughout the territories it controlled before and during the Second World War. The first Nazi camps were erected in Germany in March 1933 immediately after Hitler became Chancellor and his Nazi Party was given control over the police through Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick and Prussian Acting Interior Minister Hermann Göring. Used to hold and torture political opponents and union organizers, the camps initially held around 45,000 prisoners.

The primary purpose of having a substantial amount of guidelines and regulations in the area of transportation is to ensure the successful implementation of the joint transport policy. This is due to the constantly changing landscape and circumstances created by the single market among various nations, leading to the need for a more comprehensive and adaptable set of rules for all parties involved. A significant advantage of having a unified transport policy is that it aids in streamlining and facilitating trade and commerce among different regions. As the single market fosters stronger economic connections, countries need to adapt and modify their transportation policies and regulations accordingly. By having a more significant number of guidelines, countries can account for variations in transportation modes, road safety, environmental concerns, and infrastructural differences. Moreover, the high number of traffic regulations ensures that there is a standardized system in place, which promotes fair competition and improved safety for all road users. It helps reduce trade barriers and simplifies cross-border travel, further promoting economic growth and collaboration among nations. In summary, the principal reason behind the high number of traffic regulations is the evolution of the joint transport policy in response to the constantly changing circumstances created by the single market.

Here is a question about this article: Because the spring equinox was tied to the date of Easter, the Roman Catholic Church considered the seasonal drift in the date of Easter undesirable. The Church of Alexandria celebrated Easter on the Sunday after the 14th day of the moon (computed using the Metonic cycle) that falls on or after the vernal equinox, which they placed on 21 March. However, the Church of Rome still regarded 25 March as the equinox (until 342) and used a different cycle to compute the day of the moon. In the Alexandrian system, since the 14th day of the Easter moon could fall at earliest on 21 March its first day could fall no earlier than 8 March and no later than 5 April. This meant that Easter varied between 22 March and 25 April. In Rome, Easter was not allowed to fall later than 21 April, that being the day of the Parilia or birthday of Rome and a pagan festival.The first day of the Easter moon could fall no earlier than 5 March and no later than 2 April.

Tässä tekstissä vaaditaan Euroopan komissiota kiinnittämään huomiota esittämäämme pyyntöön ja tuomaan esille tarkistuksen vuonna 2000 annettuun direktiiviin koskien biologisten agenttien käyttöä. Biologisten agenttien direktiivi viittaa säädökseen, joka säätelee eläviä organismeja ja niistä peräisin olevia aineita, jotka saattavat aiheuttaa terveysriskejä ihmisille erilaisten sairauksien tai infektioiden kautta. Erityisesti direktiivin tavoitteena on suojella työntekijöitä altistumasta näille biologisille aineille työpaikoillaan. Siihen sisältyy erilaisia toimenpiteitä, jotka auttavat ehkäisemään työntekijöiden altistumista, kuten hygieniavaatimukset, ilmanvaihtojärjestelmät, henkilökohtaiset suojavarusteet ja koulutus. Tarkistus vaikuttaisi sekä julkisella että yksityisellä sektorilla toimiviin yrityksiin ja organisaatioihin, jotka saattavat käsitellä tai tuottaa biologisia aineita, kuten laboratoriot, terveysviranomaiset, bio- tai lääkealan yritykset ja elintarviketeollisuus. Tarkistuksen tarkoituksena olisi tehdä nykyisestä direktiivistä tehokkaampi ja paremmin vastaamaan nykyisiä ja tulevaisuuden biologisten agenttien riskejä. Tämän direktiivin tarkistaminen olisi merkittävä askel työntekijöiden terveyden lisäämiseksi ja biologisten vaarojen vähentämiseksi eri aloilla. Se voisi sisältää päivityksiä koskien biologisten aineiden luokittelua, työntekijöiden terveystarkastusten säännöllisyyttä, rajojen asettamista biologisille altistumisille sekä uusien murrosten ja biotekniikan sovellusten huomioon ottamista. Lopuksi on tärkeää, että Euroopan komissio kiinnittää huomiota tämäntyyppisiin pyyntöihin, jotta työntekijöiden suojelu ja turvallisuus voidaan taata nykyajan haasteiden mukaisesti. Mikäli direktiiviä päivitetään, on syytä varmistaa, että kaikki jäsenvaltiot implementoivat sen asianmukaisesti ja noudattavat uusia vaatimuksia, jotta työntekijöiden terveyden ja turvallisuuden taso paranee koko Euroopan unionin alueella."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Why don't plants need to eat like humans?\\" Context: \\"Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Plants do not need to eat like humans because they are autotrophs, meaning they produce their own food and obtain essential elements through alternative processes such as photosynthesis and nutrient absorption from their roots and leaves. Photosynthesis allows plants to harness energy from sunlight and convert it into chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates (glucose) using carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. This process occurs in structures called chloroplasts within the plant cells, and it releases oxygen as a byproduct. In addition to photosynthesis, plants absorb essential nutrients from the soil through their roots, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. This process takes place through a mechanism called cation exchange, where root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil, displacing nutrient cations attached to negatively charged soil particles and making them available for absorption. Plants also intake necessary gaseous elements from the atmosphere, such as nitrogen and oxygen, through tiny openings called stomata on their leaves. The stomata facilitate the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen required for photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. Thus, plants satisfy their nutritional and energy requirements through unique processes involving the absorption of nutrients from the soil, air, and sunlight, which eliminates the need for them to consume food in the same way as humans."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Their classic line-up consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist and singer Pete Townshend, bass guitarist John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, selling over 100 million records worldwide and holding a reputation for their live shows and studio work. The Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Tommy secured the Who's future, and made them millionaires. The group reacted in different ways--Daltrey and Entwistle lived comfortably, Townshend was embarrassed at his wealth, which he felt was at odds with Meher Baba's ideals, and Moon spent frivolously. During the latter part of 1970, Townshend plotted a follow up Tommy: Lifehouse, which was to be a multi-media project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience. He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were just happy to be gigging again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend that the project was too complicated and they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned Lifehouse. Entwistle was the first member of the group to release a solo album, Smash Your Head Against the Wall, in May 1971. Recording at the Record Plant in New York City in March 1971 was abandoned when Lambert's addiction to hard drugs interfered with his ability to produce. The group restarted with Glyn Johns in April. The album was mostly Lifehouse material, with one unrelated song by Entwistle, \\"My Wife\\", and was released as Who's Next in August. The album reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 4 in the US. \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" are early examples of synthesizer use in rock, featuring keyboard sounds generated in real time by a Lowrey organ; on \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", it was further processed through a VCS3 synthesizer. The synthesizer intro to \\"Baba O'Riley\\" was programmed based on Meher Baba's vital stats, and the track featured a violin solo by Dave Arbus. The album was a critical and commercial success, and has been certified 3x platinum by the RIAA. The Who continued to issue Lifehouse-related material over the next few years, including the singles \\"Let's See Action\\", \\"Join Together\\" and \\"Relay\\". The band went back on tour, and \\"Baba O' Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" became live favourites. In November they performed at the newly opened Rainbow Theatre in London for three nights, continuing in the US later that month, where Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times described the Who as \\"the Greatest Show on Earth\\". The tour was slightly disrupted at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on 12 December when Moon passed out over his kit after overdosing on brandy and barbiturates. He recovered and completed the gig, playing to his usual strength. Entity:","completion":"The Who (English rock band)"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Given the following context: Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him.

Have you ever seen your parents using metal tools like spoons, forks, or other objects with handles? Handles make it easier for us to hold things without dropping them. Today we will learn how to create our own fun handles for metal tools. We only need two things: the metal tool and two handle pieces we can make ourselves. It's super easy and fun! First, we need to get some help from an adult to drill holes in the metal handle. What is a 'drill'? A drill is a tool that spins really fast, and with a special pointy part, it can make holes in different things. So, ask your grown-up to make two holes in the handle - one near the top, and one near the bottom. The holes will help us attach the handle pieces later. Now, let's talk about handle pieces. Handle pieces are small parts that we put on the metal handle to make it more comfortable and colorful. To make the handle pieces, we need materials like foam, wood, or even an old, colorful cloth. With the help of a grown-up, cut out two handle pieces in any shape you like, but make sure they are the same size as your metal handle. You can also decorate these handle pieces with markers, stickers, or glitter to make them look fancy and unique. Once your handle pieces are ready and decorated, it's time to attach them to the metal handle. First, make sure the holes we drilled earlier in the metal handle line up with the holes in our handle pieces. You might need the help of an adult to poke holes in the handle pieces, so they match with the metal handle holes. Now, let's connect the pieces together! We can use string, ribbon, or even shoelaces to tie the handle pieces to the metal handle. To do this, thread the string or ribbon through the holes and tie a knot at each end. Your handle pieces should now be securely attached to the metal handle. And, guess what? You've just created a fun, comfortable, and unique handle for your metal tool! Enjoy using your new DIY tool with a colorful handle and make sure to tell your friends about this fun project. Remember to always ask a grown-up for help when you need to use sharp tools or make holes in things. Safety always comes first!

If we consider this situation, the primary effects on a smaller white dwarf star would be changes in the distribution of matter and energy within the solar system. However, the process outlined for a red giant becoming a white dwarf would remain relatively the same. The hypothetical changes to the solar system size might have an indirect effect on the smaller white dwarf in the sense that the surrounding environment could be altered. For example, the distances between celestial bodies would decrease, possibly affecting gravitational interactions. This could influence the orbits of planets and other celestial bodies, which might, in turn, affect the white dwarf's future interactions or collisions within the solar system.

Answer: Slugs, like all other gastropods, undergo torsion (a 180° twisting of the internal organs) during development. Question: what is a slugs slime made out of Answer:","completion":"No, the answer provided previously does not answer the question about what a slug's slime is made out of. The slime that slugs produce is primarily made out of two types of mucus, depending on the purpose for which it is used. The first one is thin and watery, utilized for locomotion, whereas the second one is thick and sticky, which is used for protection. Let's understand these two types further. 1. To move: Slugs primarily use slime for locomotion purposes. They secrete a thin, slippery coating of mucus that serves as a lubricant to lessen friction against the ground as they glide over it. This created slime trail helps them move along surfaces smoother and faster. The chemical contents of this mucus include water, glycoproteins, and ions. 2. For protection: Slugs also produce a thick, gooey form of mucus for protection. When threatened, they can secrete this heavier, sticky slime to make themselves hard to pick up or to deter predators with its unpleasant taste. Furthermore, this kind of mucus aids in moisture retention, vital for slug’s survival, as they are prone to desiccation. Additionally, it contains the element copper, which aids in the healing of slug’s body after injury, much like our body uses iron in our blood. Another curious fact about slug slime is that it has adhesive properties. This allows them to crawl across vertical surfaces, even upside-down, without falling off. It is also reportedly difficult to remove, particularly if it dries out. Further chemical analysis has revealed that slug slime is a highly ordered, liquid crystalline material. It shares some physical properties with both liquids and solids, which allow for its peculiar combination of flow and stickiness. In conclusion, slug slime is an intriguing substance that is not only crucial for their locomotion and protection but also displays some unique physical and chemical properties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was cautious about his progress as a symphonist, cowed by the example of Beethoven and discouraged by the fialure to gain performances. These fragments are extremely minor, despite the fact that the last group are sketches for a Tenth Sym. They show not even a spark of genius, and the timid reconstructions by Brian Newbould don't help. Nor do the pallid, mincing performances given by Mackerras and a lackluster Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Pass, unless you are a musicologist yourself. Answer: The answer is:","completion":"There is a negative tone to this product review. The reviewer begins by acknowledging the background of the symphonies Schubert never finished, hinting at the fact that Schubert may have been cautious and discouraged. The use of the word \\"fragments\\" indicates that these pieces may be incomplete or lacking in some way, setting up a foundation for potential criticism. The review takes on a more negative tone as the author describes the fragments as \\"extremely minor\\" and states that they \\"show not even a spark of genius.\\" This strong, dismissive language suggests that the reviewer does not believe the content of the symphonies has much artistic value. The negativity continues as the reviewer criticizes the \\"timid reconstructions\\" by Brian Newbould, implying that his efforts to flesh out the fragments do not contribute anything substantial. The review then addresses the performances by conductor Charles Mackerras and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, characterizing them as \\"pallid\\" and \\"mincing,\\" implying that they are weak or inadequate. The use of the term \\"lackluster\\" only further highlights the reviewer's disappointment with the performances. Lastly, the review ends with a recommendation to \\"pass, unless you are a musicologist yourself,\\" suggesting that this product may only be worth considering for specialized professionals.

Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- South Sudan's government has gained control of a remote town that had been under attack by fighters from a rival tribe, the nation's information minister said Monday. Some of the thousands who fled into the bush have begun to return to Pibor, said Barnaba Benjamin, South Sudan's minister of information and broadcasting. Earlier Monday, a military official said that roughly 4,000 army and police reinforcements were on the way to Pibor after weekend attacks. The United Nations also said it sent a battalion of peacekeepers to Pibor last week amid reports that members of the Lou Nuer tribe were marching toward the town, home to the Murle tribe, after attacking the village of Lukangol. She similarly said that the town of","completion":"Lukangol, which had also suffered heavy damage during the attack by the rival tribe, was slowly beginning to recover as well. With the South Sudanese government's intervention, the attack by the Lou Nuer tribe was finally put to a stop. The arrival of army and police reinforcements, as well as the UN peacekeepers, served to quell the violence and establish a temporary sense of stability in the region. The United Nations became heavily involved in peacekeeping efforts, working closely with the South Sudanese government to help restore order and mediate between the feuding tribes. The UN sought to address the underlying grievances and tensions between the Lou Nuer and the Murle peoples to prevent future conflicts. As residents began to return to their devastated towns, humanitarian aid organizations rushed to offer assistance. International NGOs collaborated with local groups to provide much-needed food, water, shelter, and medical supplies to the affected communities. South Sudan's government made significant investments to rebuild infrastructure and restore essential services. Recognizing that the attack on Pibor was part of a larger issue – the ongoing ethnic conflict between the Lou Nuer and Murle tribes – both tribes agreed to participate in peace talks facilitated by the government and UN mediators. These talks resulted in a fragile but meaningful ceasefire agreement. The leaders of both tribes committed to working together to address the long-standing disputes over land and resources that were the root causes of their conflict. Well-aware that the peace process would be fraught with challenges, international organizations continued to provide support, funding, and resources to help the South Sudanese government and tribal leaders navigate complex negotiations. The ceasefire seemed to hold, and the situation in the town of Pibor, as well as its surrounding areas, gradually improved. Over the next few years, the international community, including NGOs and foreign governments, strongly encouraged and supported a regional development plan. This plan focused on investing in education, healthcare, agriculture, and infrastructure, to foster long-term peace and development in the region. Efforts were made to encourage economic diversification and empower local communities to become more resilient and self-sufficient. The gradual restoration of trust between the Lou Nuer and Murle tribes was crucial to stability in the area. Both sides had to learn to forgive the past and be open to a new chapter of collaboration and coexistence. This was not an easy process, and there were instances of setbacks and minor skirmishes. However, the strong commitment to peace by the tribal leaders and the support from the South Sudanese government and international community ultimately led to tangible progress and healing. In the years that followed the attack on Pibor, both tribes continued to work on their relationship and contribute to rebuilding and development efforts. Trust was slowly established through collective initiatives geared toward the well-being of the whole region, transcending the ethnic tensions of the past. The story of Pibor serves as a reminder of the power of reconciliation, understanding, and unity in overcoming hate and violence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This endeared him to the local population, which was dealing with a declining economy following the closures and relocations of steel making and steel-associated businesses. In 1983, he was charged with racketeering for accepting bribes. Traficant, who represented himself in the criminal trial, argued that he accepted the bribes only as part of his own alleged secret undercover investigation into corruption. Traficant was acquitted of the charges, becoming the only person ever to win a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) case while representing himself. Publicity from the RICO trial increased Traficant's local visibility. He was elected as a Democrat to Congress from Ohio's 17th District, defeating Lyle Williams, a three-term Republican incumbent.

Article:A new report has cleared Mr McCrea of claims of inappropriate behaviour and sexual misconduct towards his staff. However, standards committee MLAs said the manner in which he occasionally treated his staff fell short of the standard they would encourage. Mr McCrea claimed the allegations were a conspiracy to force him to resign. He has faced serious scrutiny since May 2014 when his recently-formed party NI21 imploded spectacularly on the eve of a European election. Mr McCrea fell out with N121 deputy leader John McCallister over whether the party should define itself as unionist. But allegations also surfaced that Mr McCrea had engaged in bullying or sexual misconduct towards his staff. The Stormont Standards Commissioner Douglas Bain has now investigated and dismissed 12 separate complaints against Mr McCrea. The watchdog concluded that the Lagan Valley MLA was not guilty of any wrongdoing. In relation to one claim that Mr McCrea took voyeuristic photographs, Mr Bain expresses his view that some photographs presented to him had been \\"heavily doctored by a person unknown\\". The commissioner added that \\"none of these photographs was voyeuristic\\". In an accompanying report however, MLAs on Stormont's standards committee indicated their belief that Mr McCrea is not beyond criticism. They said he exercised poor judgement in allowing young women into his hotel rooms and criticised how he spoke to his staff on occasions. Mr McCrea believes the report has completely exonerated him, and he has called for sections which have been blacked out to be published in full. He has described the claims of misconduct as a political conspiracy and claimed they were made in an attempt to derail his career. The police have confirmed that a file has now been forwarded to the Public Prosecution Service following a separate matter involving Mr McCallister, who brought forward some of the claims. Mr McCrea described the complaints as \\"a complete and utter set-up\\". \\"This was an attempted political assassination and people went to extraordinary lengths to try and implicate me,\\" he said. \\"I'm fortunate that because of the way I conduct business, I was able to prove the contrary to what people were alleging.\\" The complaints led to a bitter split in NI21, and Mr McCallister left the party a short time later. He and Mr McCrea had quit the Ulster Unionist Party in 2013, setting up NI21 a few months later. In a statement, Mr McCallister said: \\"I am thankful that this long and difficult process has now drawn to a conclusion. \\"My desire throughout was that the allegations should be independently examined. It is my hope that the publication of this report will bring some sense of closure to all involved.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"1.

Q: What are the two possible reduction products for brf3? Choices: - brg and brf - brf2 and brf4 - brf and brf4 - brf and br2 A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"To determine the two possible reduction products for BrF3, let's follow these steps: 1. Identify the oxidation state of the bromine atom in BrF3. In the case of BrF3, the oxidation state of bromine (Br) is +3, as fluorine (F) has an oxidation state of -1. 2. Determine the possible oxidation states for bromine in the products: a. BrG does not exist. It would mean replacing fluorine with a \\"G\\" element, which is not realistic. b. In BrF2, the oxidation state of bromine would be +1, as fluorine maintains its oxidation state of -1. c. BrF4 cannot be considered as a reduction product, as it would represent an increase in the oxidation state of bromine from +3 to +5. d. In BrF, the oxidation state of bromine would be -1, which is its most basic state (reduction). e. In Br2, bromine is in its elemental form with an oxidation state of 0. 3. Compare the oxidation states of the products to the original compound, BrF3: - BrF2 (oxidation state of +1) represents a reduction relative to BrF3 (oxidation state of +3). - BrF (oxidation state of -1) represents an even more extreme reduction relative to BrF3. - Br2 (oxidation state of 0) also represents a reduction relative to BrF3. Based on this analysis, the two possible reduction products for BrF3 are: - BrF2 and BrF - BrF and Br2 So, the answer is: - brf and brf2 - brf and br2"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"The legendary character who turned everything he touched into gold is King Midas, a figure from ancient Greek mythology. The story of King Midas is one of the most famous tales in Greek mythology, often referred to as \\"The Golden Touch\\" or \\"The Midas Touch.\\" King Midas was a wealthy and powerful ruler of the ancient kingdom of Phrygia, situated in modern-day Turkey. He was known for his extraordinary love for gold and material wealth, which led him to ask the gods to grant his greatest desire – the ability to turn everything he touched into gold. The story goes that one day, while King Midas was walking in his garden, he came across the drunken god Silenus, a companion of Dionysus, the god of wine and festivities. Recognizing Silenus, the kind-hearted king offered him food and shelter. In gratitude for his hospitality, Dionysus granted Midas a single wish. Midas, blinded by greed, wished that everything he touched would turn into gold. Dionysus, aware of the potential consequences, reluctantly granted him the wish, but warned him to think carefully about his decision. Thrilled with his new powers, Midas started touching everything around him, and all the objects transformed into shimmering gold. However, his joy soon turned into horror when he realized the devastating consequences of his wish. Every time Midas tried to eat or drink, his food and water turned into gold. Even worse, when he tried to embrace his beloved daughter, she too transformed into a lifeless golden statue. The curse had turned his life into a living nightmare. Desperate and full of remorse, King Midas begged Dionysus to reverse the curse. The god took pity on him and told Midas to wash himself in the waters of the River Pactolus to remove the golden touch. Midas did as he was instructed and was finally rid of the curse. From that day forward, he learned the hard way that there were more important things in life than material wealth. The story of King Midas serves as a cautionary tale against greed and an allegory for finding balance and appreciating the non-material aspects of life. The phrase \\"Midas touch\\" has since become synonymous with possessing an extraordinary ability to generate wealth, though its origins remind us to be wary of the potential pitfalls that such wealth can bring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that, and why you did not do this or that. Sour(; )music, indeed, but it has to be faced. The phrase \\"to face the music\\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from? The first information comes from the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said in 1851 that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue(,) to go on, they often said, \\"It's time to go to face the music.\\" And that is exactly what they did--- face the orchestra which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. So, \\"to face the music\\" came to mean having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice. The other explanation comes from the army. Men had to face inspection by their leader. The soldiers worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection? Still, the men had to go out, and face the music of the band, as well as the inspection. What else could they do?

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who is reminded of Kaecilius by Strange's arrogance and ambition? from the following article ? In Kathmandu, the sorcerer Kaecilius and his zealots enter the secret compound Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape. In New York City, Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands, nearly bankrupting himself. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius. Strange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are all connected and accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life.

Article: When I was growing up, I had an old neighbor named Dr. Gibbs. He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never yelled at us for playing in his yard. I remember him as someone who was a lot nicer than most of the adults in our community. When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. His house sat on ten acres, and his life's goal was to make it a forest. The good doctor had some interesting theories concerning plant care and growth. He never watered his new trees, which flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them so that each successive tree generation would grow weaker and weaker. So you have to make things rough for them and weed out the weaker trees early on. He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of moisture. I took him to mean that deep roots were to be treasured. So he never watered his trees. He planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. Smack! Slap! Pow! I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention. Dr. Gibbs passed away a couple of years after I left home. Every now and again, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant some twenty-five years ago. They're extremely tall, big and robust since they have deep roots now. However, the trees in my garden trembled in a cold wind although I had watered them for several years. It seems that adversity and suffering benefit these trees in ways comfort and ease never could. I stood there deep in thought. Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two sons. I stand over them and watch their little bodies, the rising and falling of life within. I often pray for them. Mostly I pray that their lives will be easy. But I think that it's time to change my prayer because now I know my children are going to encounter hardship. Question: According to Dr. Gibbs' theories, trees will become weaker if they _ . Options: A: are lack of care B: are watered C: are weeded out D: are beaten Answer:","completion":"B: are watered"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which musical has music written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and cast non-white actors as the founding fathers? A:","completion":"A: The musical that features music written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and casts non-white actors as the founding fathers is \\"Hamilton: An American Musical.\\" This groundbreaking production has been praised for its innovative approach to both the subject matter and the casting. \\"Hamilton: An American Musical\\" is a sung-through musical that tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, one of the United States' founding fathers, incorporating elements from his early life, career, personal life, and political achievements. The musical combines elements of traditional musical theatre with contemporary music styles such as hip-hop, R&B, and pop, which help to illustrate the revolutionary spirit of the story. Lin-Manuel Miranda, a multi-talented composer, lyricist, and actor, is the creative force behind the musical. He first conceived of the idea after reading Ron Chernow's biography of Alexander Hamilton. Inspired by the life of this influential yet often overlooked historical figure, Miranda set out to create a production that would both entertain and educate audiences about the life and legacy of Hamilton. One of the most distinctive and talked-about aspects of \\"Hamilton: An American Musical\\" is its casting of non-white actors in the roles of the founding fathers and other prominent historical figures. Miranda has stated that this choice was deliberate, as he wanted the show's cast to reflect the racial and cultural diversity of present-day America. By casting actors of color in the roles of these influential figures, the production challenges conventional notions of who these figures were and highlights the contributions of non-white individuals in shaping the history of the United States. This casting decision also invites audiences to re-evaluate their perceptions of race and ethnicity and to recognize the similarities between the struggles faced by marginalized communities during Hamilton's time and those faced by people of color today. Additionally, the use of rap and hip-hop music styles in the show serves as another way to bridge the gap between past and present, allowing for historical narratives to be presented in a manner that feels contemporary and accessible to modern audiences. In summary, \\"Hamilton: An American Musical\\" is a unique and powerful production that weaves together the life story of Alexander Hamilton with the music written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, and distinguishes itself through its casting of non-white actors in the roles of the founding fathers and other historical figures. By blending traditional musical theatre with contemporary musical styles and casting choices, the show breaks new ground in terms of storytelling and representation on stage, making it a standout example in the world of theatrical productions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Historie francouzských mečů a šermu sahá až do raného středověku, kdy se v Evropě začali rozvíjet šermířské dovednosti a zručnosti. Francouzské meče sluly svou kvalitou a precizností, které byly založeny na jejich odborných zkušenostech a tréninku. Francouzské meče těžily z detailních znalostí na poli kovářství a jejich následná zručnost v boji je činila téměř legendárními. Mezi nejznámější francouzské meče patří fleret, kord a šavle, které byly běžně používány ve vojenských i soubojových situacích. Navíc šermířské umění \\"escrime\\" bylo ve Francii velmi populární, což zřejmě přispělo k jejich pověsti vysoce respektovaných a účinných mečů. Velká pozornost byla věnována i designu francouzských mečů. Byly často zdobeny detailními rytinami a elegantními dekoračními prvky, které z nich činily nejen smrtící zbraň, ale i umělecké dílo. Také muzea po celém světě nyní zobrazují příklady francouzských mečů, kde návštěvníci mohou obdivovat jejich úžasnou kvalitu a krásu. Současný šerm, který je také součástí moderních olympijských her, má své kořeny v tradičních francouzských mečích a šermířských technikách. Jejich vliv se tak rozšířil po celém světě, a i když na bojišti již dnes meč není hlavní zbraní, tradiční francouzské meče a umění šermu stále žije v srdcích a myslích nadšenců a sportovců. Z hlediska učení a metodologie byl francouzský šerm známý svými inovativními a pokrokovými technikami a taktikami, které do jisté míry ovlivnily vývoj mečů a dalších zbraní. Bez ohledu na to, zda se jedná o různé postupy útoku nebo obrany, francouzská škola šermu byla považována za jednu z nejlepších a nejprestižnějších. Konečně lze říci, že hrdost na francouzské meče a šerm je hluboce zakořeněna v historii a kultuře Francie. Zatímco mnoho jiných zemí mělo také své výjimečné meče a šermířské tradice, francouzské meče a šerm zůstávají v očích mnoha lidí symbolem dokonalosti, elegance a dovednosti."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was defeated in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War? from the following article ? The first iron-cased and metal-cylinder rocket artillery were developed by Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali, in the 1780s. He successfully used these metal-cylinder rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km (1 mi) range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.According to Stephen Oliver Fought and John F. Guilmartin, Jr. in Encyclopædia Britannica (2008): Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Tipu Sultan, continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.\\" A:","completion":"The last name of the person who was defeated in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War is Sultan.

My oldest we've nicknamed the \\"Evil Genius\\" is ambitious, self-confident, and suffers no fools. Whenever we mentioned Santa my husband and I were rewarded with major eye rolling and deep sighs from my oldest. At first we both tried to ignore it. We both knew that our eldest had figured out the big secret. But I'd be damned if he was going to ruin it for his six-year-old brother who had plenty of Santa-loving years ahead of him. I looked at my husband in the eye and said, \\"I'll handle this.\\" to which he responded \\"Okay just be careful because I'm not sure he knows - he might just be acting like it.\\" But I knew. And I had it in my mind that he was about to break his younger brothers spirit and break the news to him. I was afraid he was going to take the Christmas spirit away from my sweet innocent youngest and stamp all over it. I had to protect him. I needed to control this now before it got out of control.

Answer: Answer:","completion":"The product review provided can be considered as a mixed one. While there are elements of positivity in the review, it skews more towards negative due to the significant problems the reviewer faced with the sound quality, prompting them to ultimately return the product. The positive aspects of the review include complimenting the TV's beautiful picture and appreciating the availability of multiple inputs. Furthermore, the reviewer was impressed enough by the TV that they even exchanged it for a replacement, implying that they were initially willing to overlook the sound issues. However, the negative aspects of the review outweigh the positives. The most concerning issue for the reviewer was the sound quality, which they described as being plagued by issues such as high-pitched sounds and HDMI sound dropouts. The fact that these problems persisted in both the original and the replacement units, as well as being present in different Samsung models as per the narrator's findings, further undermines the overall satisfaction level in the review. In conclusion, while there are some positive elements in the reviewer's experience, the emphasis on the sound issues and the ultimate decision to return the product suggest that the review leans more towards negative than positive. The reviewer's closing statement highlights the degree of dissatisfaction in the product, stating that no matter how nice the picture is, the sound and noises ruin the overall experience."},{"prompt":"Q: What part of the plant is the main site of photosynthesis?

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Man is the most intelligent animal created by God because God has given him language which other animals do not have. Communication makes life extremely convenient and easy. Language plays a very important role in life as any emotion can be easily and effectively conveyed through language to anyone. But all this is applicable and beneficial only to human beings. What about animals? How do they communicate with each other? We all know that animals do not have the ability to use language as a medium for communication. But they do have other means of conveying messages to other animals, of which use of body language is the most important one. The messages can be of many types like conveying food location, danger alarms, appreciation of good deeds like helping other animals in dangerous situations, etc. There are two main types of communication in animals: verbal communication and non-verbal communication. Sound is one of the most common types of verbal communication in animals, and majority of the species use it as the medium to convey messages. Bats have to rely on sound waves to communicate. They mostly rest in the morning and become active at night to search for food and do other tasks. All the birds communicate through their chirping. Mammals generally make use of sounds to give calls to other members of their community. Whales are the perfect examples, which use sound waves for communication. They have a whale song, which they repeat after regular intervals. Facial Expressions This kind of communication is mostly found in dogs. When they are angry, they show their teeth and raise their ears. On the other hand, when they are frightened, they pull their ears behind and open their mouth. Also, in birds, when the parent bird brings food for the offspring, the begging expression can be observed on the offspring's face. Gestures and Body Movements This type of communication is common not only in animals, but in human beings too. All human beings, although they use language for communication, tend to use...

Story continuation: Jessica's wrist hurt so she took off the hot pack and applied some ice because the ice was helpful. As she gently placed the ice pack over her wrist, she could immediately feel the cooling sensation begin to seep through her aching muscles, providing instant relief. As she sat on her couch, nursing her wrist, she tried to recall what had caused the injury in the first place. Over the weekend, she had participated in a charity marathon, pushing herself to complete the grueling 26.2 miles for a cause close to her heart. In her exhaustion, she must have taken a nasty spill, laboring now to minimize the swelling and numb the pain. Jessica decided to rest her wrist for a few more minutes before attempting to use it for any activity. She had read that alternating between hot and cold treatments could help with muscle recovery, and so far, the advice seemed to be working. While the hot pack had loosened up the tight muscles and improved circulation, the ice was now playing its part in reducing inflammation and numbing the pain. Over the next few days, Jessica continued to baby her wrist, careful not to overexert or strain it further. She made an appointment with her local sports physician to check the extent of the injury and receive professional guidance on rehabilitation. As the pain in her wrist subsided, thanks to the relief brought about by the helpful ice pack, Jessica felt reassured that she was on the right track to recovery.

Her errant behavior prompts her frustrated boyfriend Tim to break up with her and evict her from their New York City apartment. Forced to move back to her hometown in New England (the fictional Mainhead), Gloria reunites with her childhood friend Oscar, who now runs his late father's bar. Oscar is warm and welcoming to Gloria; he brings her an old television set for her unfurnished house and offers her a job at the bar to help her, which Gloria accepts. Working at the bar aggravates Gloria's alcohol problem. Each shift, she hangs out and drinks until morning with Oscar and his friends, Garth and Joel, while sleeping it off on a bench near a children's playground. At the same time, a giant reptilian monster appears in Seoul, leaving death and destruction in its wake. Gradually, Gloria realizes that when she walks through the playground at exactly 8:05 am, she causes the monster to manifest and is able to remotely control the monster's movements, which mirror her own. Gloria reveals her secret to Oscar and his friends; however, when Oscar steps onto the playground, he causes a giant robot to appear in Seoul.

The modern Republic of Turkey dates only from 1923, but the history of the land within its borders stretches back to the dawn of humanity. Widespread finds of Stone Age implements in cave excavations show that Anatolia was already inhabited during the Middle of the Palaeolithic period (about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago). By Neolithic times, organized communities had arisen, such as the one at Çatalhöyük, near Konya, Turkey's most important prehistoric site. This town, which flourished between 6500 and 5500 b.c. , had flat-roofed houses of mud and timber decorated with wall-paintings, some of which show patterns that still appear on Anatolian kilims. The advent of the Bronze Age (about 3200 b.c. ), and the spread of city-states ruled by kings, is marked by the appearance of royal tombs containing bronze objects in such places as Troy in the west, and Alacahöyük near Ankara. Around this time the Sumerian civilization living in Mesopotamia (the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-day Iraq) founded and developed the cuneiform script, the world's oldest form of writing on record. The technique was introduced by Assyrian traders 1,000 years later in­to Anatolia, where it was qui­ck­ly adopted by the indigenous Hatti people, who, at this point, had already reached an ad­­vanced state of civilization. The Hittites: The capital of the Hatti was Kanesh (modern Kültepe, near Kayseri). Cuneiform tablets found here record the arrival in Anatolia of warlike invaders around the second mill­ennium b.c. Their origins remain a my­s­tery (their written language was finally deciphered in 1915), but they came from the direction of the Caucasus moun­tains, spreading destruction and disorder throughout Anatolia. It was two hundred years before they were firmly entrenched in their newly conquered empire. The newcomers were the Hittites, and their domination of Anatolia can be divided into three distinct periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 1600–1450 b.c. ), then the New or Empire Period (c. 1450–1200 b.c. ), and the Late Hittite Period (c.

Process: - Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant - Is trapped - Plant also takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment - The plant forms glucose - The plant releases oxygen into the atmosphere. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more sunlight during the day happens, how will it affect LESS sugar and oxygen being produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"In the photosynthesis process, sunlight is a critical factor as it provides the energy required to fuel the process. When sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant, the energy absorbed is utilized to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen, which is then released back into the environment. The perturbation hypothesis that you present considers a scenario where there is more sunlight during the day. In general, an increase in sunlight should lead to more energy being available for the photosynthesis process. However, the hypothesis questions whether this increase in sunlight would result in less sugar (glucose) and oxygen being produced. To analyze the impact of increased sunlight on glucose and oxygen production, we need to consider several factors: 1. Rate of Photosynthesis: An increase in sunlight generally enhances the rate of photosynthesis, as there is more energy available for the process. However, plants may have an optimal sunlight level beyond which they experience no additional benefit. This means that past a certain point, increasing sunlight may not lead to increased photosynthesis rates, and as such, will not directly result in less glucose or oxygen production. 2. Plant's Physiological Adaptations: Plants have evolved to optimize their use of sunlight and prevent damage from excess sunlight. In the case of more sunlight, plants may respond by altering their photosynthetic machinery or orientation to avoid excess light and maximize their photosynthetic efficiency. Some plants can also regulate the opening and closing of stomata (small openings in leaves) to regulate gas exchange. These adaptations help plants maintain optimal photosynthesis rates but may not necessarily result in less glucose and oxygen production. 3. Environmental Factors: An increase in sunlight may create higher temperatures, which can directly impact the rate of photosynthesis. Higher temperatures can lead to more rapid water loss from plants, causing them to close their stomata to conserve water. This action reduces the availability of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, affecting the production of glucose and oxygen. Moreover, extremely high temperatures can damage the photosynthetic apparatus in the plant, reducing its ability to produce glucose and oxygen. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis proposes that an increase in sunlight during the day could affect the production of glucose and oxygen. While more sunlight generally stimulates the photosynthesis process, there may be situations where a plant's physiological adaptations, environmental factors, or limitations in the rate of photosynthesis could lead to less sugar and oxygen production. However, these conditions would most likely be indirect effects of increased sunlight rather than direct impacts on the photosynthesis process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What do people experience when they take the drug Fred is investigating? from the following article ? The United States has lost the war on drugs. Substance D, a powerful and dangerous drug that causes bizarre hallucinations, has swept the country. Approximately 20% of the total population is addicted. In response, the government has developed an invasive, high-tech surveillance system and a network of undercover officers and informants. Bob Arctor is one of these undercover agents, assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate the supply chain.

Please answer this question: Political Aide Alastair Campbell was best known as Director of Communications and Strategy for which British Prime Minister?","completion":"Alastair Campbell is best known for serving as the Director of Communications and Strategy for Tony Blair, who served as the British Prime Minister from 1997 to 2007. Tony Blair was the leader of the Labour Party and held the position of Prime Minister for three consecutive terms, making him one of the longest-serving Prime Ministers in British history. Born in 1957, Alastair Campbell initially pursued a career in journalism, writing for various newspapers and working as a Political Editor for the Daily Mirror. His journalistic career, which spanned over a decade, earned him a considerable reputation as a shrewd political commentator. In the early 1990s, Campbell became more involved with the Labour Party, and his long-lasting association with Tony Blair began. He became Blair's press spokesman in 1994 after Blair became the leader of the Labour Party. Through Blair's successful 1997 election campaign, Campbell played a pivotal role in shaping the party's image and message, leading to the landslide victory that brought the Labour Party into power after 18 years of Conservative rule. Once in office, Campbell was appointed as the Downing Street Press Secretary. However, he had a much broader role than a typical press secretary, as he was responsible not only for managing the Prime Minister's media relations but also for developing long-term strategies that aimed to achieve the government's overarching goals. His role was later expanded to include setting communications strategy and policy, earning him the title of Director of Communications and Strategy. Alastair Campbell played a particularly important role in promoting New Labour's modernizing agenda and its focus on pragmatism, which aimed to balance the demands of both the center-left and center-right political factions. Moreover, he was instrumental in shaping several significant policy initiatives, such as the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and the government's response to the 9/11 attacks. However, Campbell also faced several controversies during his tenure, most notably regarding the \\"dodgy dossier\\" on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The dossier's inaccurate claims led to widespread criticism and raised questions about the government's case for military intervention in Iraq. Campbell later resigned from his post in 2003, amid increasing political pressure and personal reasons. After leaving the government, Alastair Campbell has continued to be involved in a variety of activities, including writing, political commentary, and working with various charities. While his career has been marked by both triumphs and controversies, he remains a key figure in the story of Tony Blair's premiership and the development of modern political communication in Britain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The first Prime Minister of Ceylon when it became independent on 14 October 1947 was Don Stephen Senanayake. He emerged as a prominent political figure in Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka) and played a vital role in leading the country towards independence from British rule. As the leader of the United National Party (UNP), Senanayake became the first head of government of the newly independent nation. Don Stephen Senanayake was born on October 20, 1884, in the village of Botale, which is situated in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. He came from a family with strong political connections that would later support him in his political career. His father, Don Spater Senanayake, was a renowned village leader and a local Mudaliyar, while his brothers, Don Charles Senanayake and Frederick Richard Senanayake, both served in the State Council of Ceylon and were actively involved in the struggle for independence. Senanayake's journey into politics began when he was elected to the Colombo Municipal Council in 1916. Later, he was appointed as a representative of the Legislative Council of Ceylon in 1924, where he championed the cause of agrarian reform and furthering the interests of local industries. He was subsequently chosen as a member of the State Council of Ceylon in 1931, and by 1936, he had been appointed as the Minister of Agriculture and Lands. Through his work in the State Council, Senanayake was able to connect with various political leaders who similarly sought independence for their homeland. In 1943, he united these leaders and formed the United National Party (UNP), which rapidly gained popularity across Ceylon. As the leader of the UNP, Senanayake negotiated with the British government for a smooth transfer of power, leading to the successful attainment of independence on 14 October 1947. Upon assuming the role of the first Prime Minister of Ceylon, Senanayake focused on the development and modernization of the country. He implemented policies aimed at improving infrastructure, promoting agricultural growth, and ensuring rapid industrialization. Furthermore, he emphasized the establishment of a united multi-ethnolinguistic nation by advocating for religious, cultural, and linguistic tolerance. During his tenure, Senanayake worked toward maintaining a close relationship with the British Commonwealth and pursued a neutral stance in global political affairs. Tragically, his life and term as Prime Minister were both cut short when he died in a horse-riding accident on March 22, 1952. In conclusion, Don Stephen Senanayake was the first Prime Minister of Ceylon when it gained independence from British rule on 14 October 1947. A prominent politician who served as the leader of the United National Party, he played an instrumental role in securing independence for Ceylon and shepherding the nation in its initial years of self-governance. Senanayake's contributions to modernizing the country and advocating for harmony amongst its diverse communities are still revered today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Review title: Dissapointing Product review: I bought \\"Results May Vary\\" (the previous album) as my first Limp Bizkit album. I thought I was a new Limp Bizkit fan. I loved every song on the CD. Fred Durst sang well and the melodies were extremely creative and addicting. The guitar was amazing and the unique time changes really amazed me. As a newly found Limp fan, I bought this new EP at first sight. Well, I totally wasted my money. I can't even begin to describe how dissapointed I am in this latest release. Wes Borland is back with the band and his riffs sound so choppy and disorganized. No more melodic tones, no more singing. Fred Durst just raps his way through all the crazy out of place guitar. It sounds like they have this Rage Against the Machine influence, and it's so out of place for Limp. This album stinks...soooo bad. I'm either selling it to a used CD store, burning it, or trashing it...just as long as I don't have to listen to it or see it again. I'm officially an ex-Limp fan.","completion":"The mentioned review would likely decrease the chances of you buying the product (in this case, the album).

Article: At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s, less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich, four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor. Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school, most of them being boys. Nasser's policies changed this. Land reform and distribution, the dramatic growth in university education, and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve. From academic year 1953-54 through 1965-66, overall public school enrolments more than doubled. Millions of previously poor Egyptians, through education and jobs in the public sector, joined the middle class. Doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, journalists, constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser. During the 1960s, the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.

Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

Where Christine had an affinity for the elegance and majesty of horse racing, Jessica found the thrill and speed of dog races exciting and unpredictable. 1) Christine placed their bet on Lassie. As the sun climbed into the sky and the aroma of freshly cut grass filled the air at the racetrack, Christine patiently studied the list of horses and jockeys. She was experienced in the art of handicapping and meticulously reviewed the various factors that might impact the outcome of the race. After much contemplation, she decided to place her bet on a promising young filly named Lassie. Lassie had an impressive lineage, strong connections in her trainer and jockey, and a quick, light-footed stride. Smiling confidently, Christine walked to the ticket counter.

Dogs barked and howled in the background, and the air was thick with the scent of hot dogs and sweat. Clutching her racecard, Jessica scrutinized each entry, weighing their merits and flaws. One dog, in particular, caught her eye—a sleek, powerful greyhound named Lassie.

In the new film, last year's victors Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her partner Peeta are back home after winning the 74thHunger Games. Katniss just wants to live a normal life. However, that never seems to happen. She has nightmares, which remind her that she is a killer. Her worst nightmare comes true when the annual Hunger Games arrive again. The teenager finds herself back in the competition along with Peeta. Since Katniss brings hope to Panem through her courage, President Snow plans to use this year's Games to kill off Katniss and Peeta and in turn _ the fires of rebellion. \\"This is the next step of Katniss' heroism and the next part of her journey to finding out who she is really going to be,\\" Lawrence told Reuters. Fast-paced and full of action, Catching Fire looks to outdo the success that the first film had in 2012. With a 97 percent rating on the movie review website Rotten Tomatoes, it is enjoying positive reviews. Critics have praised it for being faithful to the book written by American author Suzanne Collins. The Hollywood Reporter said that Catching Fire outshines the first movie a lot. Jennifer Lawrence, who won a best actress Oscar this year for her 2012 movie Silver Linings Playbook, has helped Catching Fire find success, Forbes pointed out. The 23-year-old actress does well playing a young lady who hates what she was forced to do to stay alive yet is determined not to give up. \\"Lawrence's down-to-earth personality in real life won the hearts of the public.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: The transport of sediments by longshore currents is called longshore drift . Longshore drift is created in this way: Sediment is moved up the beach by an incoming wave. The wave approaches at an angle to the shore. Water then moves straight offshore. The sediment moves straight down the beach with it. The sediment is again picked up by a wave that is coming in at an angle. So longshore drift moves sediment along the shore. This zig-zag motion is pictured below ( Figure below ) and can also be seen at the link below. Choices: - boats - foods - grass - sediment A: A:","completion":"The correct option from the provided choices is \\"sediment\\".

Answer:","completion":"The review provided for \\"Sorry Joe\\" can be classified as negative. While the reviewer does express some positive sentiments about Joe's character, the core feedback regarding the book itself is not favorable. The reviewer describes the book as being \\"very boring\\" and less interesting than reading a VCR manual's programming section. This commentary clearly reflects dissatisfaction with the book and suggests that the reader did not find it engaging or enjoyable. In addition, the offer to join Joe for a beer does not serve to counterbalance the negative aspects of the review. It merely serves as a way to indicate that the reviewer does not have any personal animosity towards the author but rather solely based on the book's content and overall experience of reading it. This distinction helps to reinforce the negative nature of the critique, while still maintaining a certain level of politeness and consideration for the author's feelings. In conclusion, while there are some positive aspects mentioned in terms of the author's personality, the central focus of the review is to communicate the reader's dissatisfaction with the book.

Oscar Pistorius Murder Trial for Reeva Steenkamp's Death Good morning from the North Gauteng High CourtHere's what we expect from day 23 of the Oscar Pistorius trial- Gerrie Nel will continue his cross-examination of Pistorius for day five. Pistorius has now been on the stand for seven days.- We expect Nel to focus on what happened after he found Reeva Steenkamp in the toilet after he shot her. Here's a summary of what we heard on day 22 of the Oscar Pistorius trial - Nel started by quizzing Pistorius on why Reeva's jeans would have been on the floor if everything else pointed to the fact she was a neat person.- He then moved to the blue LED light Pistorius said he saw on the night of the shooting. Nel put it to him his version couldnt be true as the amplifier was on, and there were other lights on as well on the sound system, which he would have seen in the night.- He asked OP about Reeva eating within two hours of her death, something Pistorius could not explain.- Nel said it was improbable that Reeva could have gone downstairs to eat as the alarm would have gone off.- Nel then asked who OP remembered going upstairs from the police first. OP said he remembered a policeman, and then Col van Rensburg. He later admitted he could not disagree with Van Rensburg's version that he wasn't the first on the scene.- Nel pointed out the fan - in Van Rensburg's version - was in the spot in the photo shown to OP previously and not where he put it. OP disagreed.- Nel then pointed out there was blood splatter on the duvet and on the carpet, Nel said the duvet was on the floor, OP denies this. Nel says it must have been \\"sheer luck\\" that the policeman put it in that particular spot as Pistorius alleges- Nel pointed out Pistorius lied when he said he whispered to Steenkamp, and now says it was talking softly. Pistorius initially denies he lied, then says it was a mistake.- Nel points out that the window sliding open and hitting the window frame is not in OP's bail application or plea explanation.- He then asks OP what he shouted as he went down the hall. OP says \\"Get the f*** out, get the f*** out\\" then breaks down and cries. Says later it was the trauma that made him cry.- Crucially Nel then got Pistorius to admit he wasn't using the Putitive Self Defence defence, by admitting he didn't fire at the perceived danger, but that it was an involuntary discharge. This is a massive change in the defence.- Nel said to Pistorius he fired \\"at Reeva\\". \\"I didn't fire at Reeva\\" he answered breaking down again.- Nel said the wood sound Pistorius claims to have heard that made him shoot was the magazine rack, and that he heard it when Reeva fell, \\"you changed aim\\" Nel said, OP denies this.- Nel got OP to say defence tested his screams, but Nel asks why this was never played to the court witnesses to hear if it was they heard.- After lunch Nel grilled Pistorius on how Reeva walked in the dark to the bathroom, OP said she may have used her cellphone as a light. \\"Then you would have seen it\\" Nel snapped back.- Nel got Pistorius to say \\"I blame myself for taking Reeva's life\\"- Nel also quizzed Pistorius on his jump from thinking it was intruders to thinking it was Reeva.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How can I draw a picture on glass so that it doesn't wash off easily? Select from: +Use a colored pencil. +Use a permanent Sharpie marker.","completion":"To determine which solution is better for drawing a picture on glass that doesn't wash off easily, I will analyze the properties and effectiveness of each option: 1. Using a colored pencil: Colored pencils generally use a combination of wax and pigment to create color. While they may work on glass surfaces, they can be easily smudged, scratched off, or washed away with water. 2. Using a permanent Sharpie marker: Permanent Sharpie markers use a combination of permanent ink and a solvent that allows the ink to dry quickly. Once the ink is dry, it becomes resistant to water and can be difficult to remove from non-porous surfaces like glass. Step-by-step analysis: - Colored pencils are designed primarily for use on paper or other porous surfaces, not on non-porous surfaces like glass. - The wax in colored pencils is not water-resistant or permanent, making it ill-suited for our goal of creating a picture on glass that doesn't wash off easily. - Permanent Sharpie markers are specially designed for use on a variety of surfaces, including glass. - The ink in a permanent Sharpie marker is water-resistant, making it difficult to wash off from non-porous surfaces.

Here is a premise: The cloud of doom over Lamar Alexander's campaign. Here is a hypothesis: Lamar Alexander's campaign is breaking records and gaining steam. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Analyzing the given premise and hypothesis, it is important to take a closer look at the factors surrounding Lamar Alexander's campaign and discern whether there exists any correlation or causality. The premise provided – \\"The cloud of doom over Lamar Alexander's campaign\\" – implies that his campaign is experiencing or facing issues that threaten its success. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that Lamar Alexander's campaign is \\"breaking records and gaining steam,\\" suggesting substantial success and growing momentum. To conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, we must consider two potential scenarios: 1. The problems associated with the \\"cloud of doom\\" are stimulating the campaign to break records and gain momentum. 2. The premise and hypothesis are unrelated or contradictory to each other. Scenario 1: Problems stimulating campaign success In this scenario, the underlying assumption is that the issues associated with the \\"cloud of doom\\" are, in fact, galvanizing the campaign to achieve new heights in terms of records and momentum. Although this situation is not impossible, it is generally unlikely. A series of negative events or problems in a campaign might sometimes motivate campaign management and supporters to work harder and push for greater success. However, the \\"cloud of doom\\" phrase suggests a degree of severity and negativity that can lead to unwanted consequences like loss of confidence and decreased support from the public. Consequently, it is improbable for a campaign experiencing severe difficulties to consistently break records and gain momentum. Based on this analysis, it is hard to establish a direct correlation between the premise and the hypothesis in this scenario. Scenario 2: Unrelated or contradictory premise and hypothesis In this situation, it is imperative to consider if the premise and hypothesis are unrelated or even contradictory. In doing so, it becomes clear that the premise and hypothesis appear to be conflicting statements, as one claims a negative situation (cloud of doom) while the other asserts significant success and growth for Lamar Alexander's campaign. There is no apparent connection that would necessarily imply that if the premise is true – i.e., the campaign is facing a cloud of doom – then the hypothesis of the campaign breaking records and gaining steam is also true. Instead, the two propositions seem contradictory, which would make it highly unlikely for both to be accurate simultaneously. Conclusion: Upon assessing the premise and hypothesis, it is evident that no direct correlation or causality exists between the two propositions. As such, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis present conflicting ideas, and when considering their incompatibility, it would be more reasonable to deduce that the two claims cannot coexist truthfully."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You can do this either using a Sharpie for a simple circuit or a printed out version from a computer program. Only one of these is needed, so select according to your preference. The schematic should contain a detailed description of all parts, as well as easy to follow connections. If no simulation program is used, assemble and test one or more prototypes of the circuit on a breadboard. Breadboards are very easy to use, and allow one to view the results of a circuit in real time without the need for solder or permanent etches. Circuit boards are about a dollar apiece, and are simply a layer of copper over an insulator. The typical size is usually 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) by 5 inches (12.7 cm). Drawing is simple; all that is required is an indelible marker, such as a Sharpie. A ruler is also helpful. (Skip this step if you aren’t using the computer program and are using the Sharpie method.) Print the design out from the software's print menu. Make sure the print is on a glossy paper (like those in magazines or separate glossy paper). Turn on the electric iron (the same one used for clothes). Carefully cut out the design and position it on the circuit board. Put the hot iron directly on top of the circuit board for about 45 seconds. Take the circuit board (careful it's hot). Wash the paper out such that the black ink is stuck to the copper circuit board. Draw out your circuit on your board with the Sharpie. Note that it's really difficult to draw out a circuit design in real life, unless it's as simple as a led and a battery. Keep in mind that copper cannot be between components, for example, if connecting an LED, there must be a gap in the copper between the positive and negative points of connectivity. Without a gap, the electricity would flow around the LED, as opposed to through it. Remember laws of electricity, all circuits must end at either a negative or ground, or no current will flow.

Reviewing the options, we can eliminate options that are not directly related to the benefits of going public: A. revealing information - This is vague and does not give a clear reason for going public. B. being ridiculed - This is negative and not a reason for a company to choose to go public. C. problems - This is also vague and not a specific benefit of going public. E. telling all - This is also vague and unclear as a reason for going public. 3. This leaves us with option D. more funding, which is the most suitable answer.

Bush was the only U.S. president whose grandfather was also a president. His full name is George Walker Bush, and he was the 43rd President of the United States, serving two terms between 2001 and 2009. George W. Bush is the eldest son of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Bush. His father, George H.W. Bush, was the 41st President of the United States, serving from 1989 to 1993. George W. Bush's presidency is notable for events such as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the subsequent declaration of a \\"War on Terror,\\" as well as the military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. George W. Bush was born on July 6, 1946 in New Haven, Connecticut. He attended Yale University and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in History in 1968. After completing his studies, he enlisted in the Texas Air National Guard and later was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve. He later went on to earn his Master's degree in Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1975. Before entering politics, George W. Bush worked in the oil industry in West Texas and was a co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He followed in his father's political footsteps and was elected as the Governor of Texas in 1994. He served two consecutive terms as governor before running for the presidency in 2000. As a president, George W. Bush pursued numerous policies including tax cuts, education reform, and environmental regulations. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, he led the nation through a difficult time, launching military operations on terrorism groups, forming the Department of Homeland Security, and creating controversial acts such as the USA PATRIOT Act to strengthen national security. His grandfather, Prescott Bush, was not a president, but a U.S senator representing Connecticut from 1952 to 1963. However, George W. Bush remains the only U.S. president with a direct familial lineage to another president, with his father being the 41st President of the United States, George H.W. Bush. This unique familial connection in the U.S. political landscape demonstrates the legacy of the Bush family and their continuous impact on American politics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1993 Stock formed 'Love This Records', and built a brand new multimillion-pound recording studio in London. The first record released with 'Love This Records' was a dance cover of the track Total Eclipse of the Heart. It was a worldwide hit for Nicki French, reaching No. 2 in America and No. 1 in seven countries selling over 2 million copies. In 1994 Simon Cowell asked Stock to produce the record for the popular kid's TV show 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' which was a top 5 hit in the UK. Cowell had worked with Stock on previous occasions with artists such as Sinitta, for whom Stock wrote and produced various hits like Toy Boy in 1987. Stock again collaborated with Cowell in 1993 on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) album Wrestlemania which spawned the No. 4 hit 'Slam Jam'. In 1994 Stock produced several artists for Simon Cowell including Kym Mazelle, Jocelyn Brown and Robson and Jerome. Their cover of Unchained Melody produced by Stock and Aitken became the highest selling non-charity single of the decade, remaining at No. 1 for 7 weeks in 1995 selling 2.5 million copies. Stock produced a further two No. 1 singles with Robson and Jerome and two No. 1 albums. After several years producing hits for Stock's own label 'Love This Records' and with Simon Cowell for BMG/RCA, the structural integrity of Stock's studio became compromised by the tunnelling of the Jubilee Line extension, and the damage forced Stock to pursue legal action against London Underground. As a result, Stock was forced to pull out of a joint deal with Cowell and BMG to produce several artists including the band Westlife in 1996. In 1998 Stock and Aitken teamed up with Steve Crosby who had created the group Steps, to form the band Scooch. Their first single 'When My Baby' reached No. 29 and their follow up, 'More Than I Needed To Know', was a top 5 hit in the UK in 2000 and went to No. 1 in Japan. Scooch's album 'Four Sure' spawned two more top 20 singles. Stock also scored a top 20 with 'Airhead' by girl band Girls@Play, with EastEnders' star Rita Simons that toured with Steps. In 2003 Stock formed the label Better the Devil Records and had a huge hit with the Fast Food Song selling 200,000 CD singles.

Write highlights for this article: Peter Greste's family are holding their breath for Egypt's president to deport the jailed Australian journalist after a court ordered a retrial. An Egyptian court has ordered Greste and his two colleagues, Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed, be retried after more than a year in jail. Greste's family is hopeful Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will honour a decree he issued in November which gives him the power to repatriate foreign prisoners detained in Egypt. Greste's brother Andrew says the retrial presents a window of opportunity because Peter has become an accused, rather than a convicted, person. Scroll down for video. Retrial: Egyptian Baher Mohamed (left), Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy (centre) and Australian journalist Peter Greste (right) pictured at an earlier hearing. Mike (left) and Andrew (right) Greste, brothers of Australian journalist Peter Greste, speak to media during a press conference in Brisbane. 'Hope': Mohamed Fahmy (left), Peter Greste (centre) and Baher Mohamed (right) will face a retrial. \\"It really opens up this option under the presidential decree,\\" he said. \\"Now that Peter is essentially an innocent man, he's not convicted anymore, it does allow for some room to move and for him (al-Sisi) to step in ... and deport them.\\" Peter Greste's lawyer has applied to the Egyptian attorney-general for deportation. The retrial effectively means the original legal proceedings now count for nothing, international law expert Don Rothwell says. \\"The ordering of a fresh trial is a real vindication, I think, for Greste, his legal team and others who have been pointing out the irregularities in the case,\\" he said. \\"It's reflective of a decision by the Egyptian legal system that they recognise there were flaws with the first trial.\\" Greste's brothers Mike (left) and Andrew (right) are hopeful Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will honour a decree he issued in November which gives him the power to repatriate foreign prisoners detained in Egypt. 'Disappointed': Marwa Omara, the fianceé of Mohamed Fahmy, outside the Egyptian court (left), while Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (right) says the court's decision was some cause for optimism. Andrew Greste said it was not clear how long the process would take. \\"We've got to be hopeful. It's a new decree and there's very little understood about it, there's very little regulation, there's no precedent. We are in uncharted waters,\\" he said. \\"I'd like to think the decree was enacted to be used. We are going to test it out.\\" If deportation is unsuccessful, the family will apply for bail at the retrial. Mike Greste said the past 12 months of fighting for his brother's freedom had been full of confusion and \\"trying to come to terms with a system we are totally unfamiliar with and having to take one day at a time\\". Their parents, Juris and Lois Greste, have been in Egypt for a month and are allowed to visit their son every 15 days but have not had a chance yet to talk to him about the latest events.

Imprisonment: Presiding Judge Mohamed Nagy Shehata handing down the sentences to the journalists last year. Lois Greste said they were initially dismayed the court did not throw out the original conviction, but \\"despite some of our disappointments, I think overall it's been a good outcome today.\\" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop agreed the court's decision was some cause for optimism. \\"He's back in the position of an accused person awaiting a trial rather than a convicted person facing seven years in jail,\\" she told ABC television on Friday.

No The sentence \\"In official Latin documents of the old Commonwealth, hereditary szlachta are referred to as \\"nobilitas\\" and are indeed the equivalent in legal status of the English nobility.\\" does not directly answer the question \\"What are two adjectives that best describe the szlachta?\\" as it focuses more on the legal status, class, and title of the szlachta. To properly answer the question, let's discuss the two adjectives that best describe the szlachta. The szlachta was the noble class in Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which later, formed a part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Here are two adjectives that best describe the szlachta: 1. Privileged: The szlachta enjoyed numerous legal and political privileges in comparison to the non-noble population. They had the right to own land, were entitled to certain exemptions from taxes, and held exclusive rights to hold certain political offices. They were also protected by specific laws, such as the ability to only be judged by their peers and having a higher social status in society. 2. Influential: The szlachta held significant power in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. They had an essential role in the political system of the time, specifically in the legislative process, where they had the right to attend and vote in the Sejm (the national parliament). Due to their exclusive right to participate in politics, combined with their wealth, education, and social status, they were a highly influential class in the country, shaping the Commonwealth's policies and social norms to their own interests. In conclusion, while the sentence provided offers a crucial insight into the legal status of the szlachta, it doesn't respond to the request for adjectives that describe them. The two adjectives that best characterize the szlachta are \\"privileged\\" and \\"influential,\\" reflecting their special status in society and their role in the political and social dynamics of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its No. 1 opening smashes a record set by Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014 when that Disney/Marvel movie blasted off with 94.3 million on its way to 333.2 million. It also narrowly outpaced February's opening of another dark superhero comedy, Deadpool, which started with 132.4 million and much stronger reviews (84% positive on RottenTomatoes.com, compared with Suicide's 26% approval rating). The Warner Bros. and DC Comics film is also the first 100 million North American opening for Will Smith, who co-stars with Margot Robbie, Cara Delevingne and Jai Courtney as bad guys tasked with saving the world. Jared Leto appears as The Joker, and Viola Davis plays a government official who assembles the team. Suicide finished just below estimates of many box office trackers, who had predicted a 140 million weekend. Despite scathing reviews, 73% of moviegoers liked it, according to Rotten Tomatoes, and audiences gave it a B-plus at CinemaScore. \\"This is one of the films that people pegged all summer long to do this type of business,\\" says Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \\"The reviews are usually a barometer of a big drop next weekend. I don't know that it'll be as bad as Batman v Superman\\" — which tumbled 69% after opening with 166 million in March — \\"but it's still not quite on par with what Marvel is doing. All their films received really high marks across the board.\\" Suicide was certainly front-loaded, with a 41% drop from Friday to Saturday. But \\"the good news, despite those critical barbs, is that this is the last major tentpole of the summer,\\" says comScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. With only Sausage Party, Florence Foster Jenkins and Pete's Dragon opening nationwide next weekend, \\"they're going to have a pretty wide-open playing field into Labor Day, which will be the official end to a very volatile, unpredictable summer movie season.\\" Matt Damon's latest Jason Bourne installment raced to No. 2 and 22.7 million in its second weekend (103.4 million in 10 days). R-rated comedy Bad Moms held strong with 14.2 million (51.1 million total), and The Secret Life of Pets barked up 11.6 million for No. 4 (319.6 million total). Star Trek Beyond rounds out the top five with 10.2 million (127.9 million total), and Kevin Spacey's family comedy Nine Lives makes its debut at No. 6 with 6.5 million. Final numbers are expected Monday. Matt Damon in 'Jason Bourne.'

Emojis, if any, used in the tweet would provide a greater depth of sentiment as well. Users often employ ellipsis (...) to represent a pause, suggesting there might be more to the sentiment than meets the eye. Normally it might indicate hesitance, thoughtfulness, vague longing, anticipation, implying something left unsaid. But given the lack of contextual cues, it's difficult to definitively ascertain the purpose of the ellipsis in this case. Sentiment analysis can be complex, as it involves understanding humor, sarcasm, and context, and even bilingual or multilingual slang in some cases, which can make it challenging to determine the true sentiment of the message with confidence.

Kansas City police are investigating about 20 shootings that could be part of a pattern of recent highway and roadway shootings. Federal authorities have added cash to a reward fund, bringing the total available reward to 7,000 for information leading to an arrest. Anyone with information should call the TIPS Hotline at 816-474-TIPS (8477). The number likely will fluctuate daily, police said, as detectives continue to learn of new cases, review them for similarities and decide which ones should be pursued further or ruled out. About seven new cases were added Wednesday to a possible pattern of 13 shootings since March 8 that police analysts identified over the weekend. Also Wednesday, investigators said they were looking into another incident, the shooting of a Leawood house, as possibly being part of the pattern. Leawood homeowners reported finding a bullet hole in their house March 28 not far from where someone shot at a motorist March 29 on Interstate 435 near State Line Road in a separate incident. The homeowners werent home at the time, so they dont know exactly when it occurred but believe it was between March 25 and 28. The timing and vicinity lead police to include it in their investigation of the 13 roadway shootings, police said. We cant say for certain if its related to anything else, but were not ruling anything out just because its not a car, said Capt. Tye Grant, the Police Departments top spokesman. The house shooting was one of the new details discussed at Wednesdays briefing, attended by Police Chief Darryl Forté, his analysts and detectives, federal agents and highway troopers. Forté has called for daily briefings on the investigation and said he provides updates to Mayor Sly James daily and police board members regularly. As soon as police detected the pattern, Forté asked for help from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Specially trained ATF dogs were out again Wednesday looking for shell casings at various shooting scenes, including Bruce R. Watkins Drive and 75th Street, where a victim not counted among the 13 was shot at Friday night. Police on Wednesday also discussed how to control misinformation circulating about the string of shootings, which is drawing national media attention. Police have said they linked several of the 13 shootings to one another, but they wont reveal how or how many, because they think it would be detrimental to the investigation. They are also employing various strategies to prevent future shootings and arrest the shooter or shooters, but they dont want to divulge those details. There are a lot of things Id like to talk about, Forté said. But it wouldnt be prudent. The shootings started to occur sporadically in early March but accelerated last week with shootings reported every day from Wednesday through Sunday. No new shootings have been linked to the pattern since Sunday, Grant said. Analysts are looking into reports of gunshots on roadways prior to March 8 to see if additional shootings fit the possible pattern. Detectives are prioritizing new reports generated by analysts or other agencies into stacks of shootings that likely are related and ones that are less likely. Police also beefed up patrols in the areas where shootings occurred. More than 30 tips had been called in to the TIPS Hotline by Wednesday afternoon, authorities said. Eleven of the originally recognized 13 shootings occurred on highways. Ten of those occurred in Kansas City, with others in Leawood, Blue Springs and Lees Summit. All of the shootings have occurred near highway ramps or road splits, where the shooter could veer off in a different direction from the victim after firing shots. But police said they are open to the possibility that the shooter could be on the ground hiding, although they have no evidence to support that. We are confident that some have occurred from vehicles, Forté said. In other cases, we dont know. The shootings have wounded three people  two in the leg and one in the arm. We have been extremely lucky that no one has been seriously hurt, Grant said. These acts have real consequences. People could die, and the person doing this could go to prison for the rest of their life. It is not a game. Police have recovered at least six bullets from vehicles and one from a victims arm. The bullets appear to come from a handgun. Detectives recovered an eighth bullet from another similar case that wasnt counted in the original 13 reports. In that case, a Johnson County woman was driving on Bruce R. Watkins Drive near 75th Street about 7:45 p.m. Friday when she heard a loud bang. She thought at first a rock had been kicked into her car by another vehicle, but she could not see any other vehicles close to her. The next night, her husband spotted a bullet hole on the passenger side of her car near the trunk. In my case, I really dont think the gunfire was coming from a vehicle, she said. She drove to a police station Sunday to report it. Police initially didnt take her report very seriously, she said. But when she called the TIPS Hotline on Monday after hearing about the other cases, a detective called her right back, she said. She said she plans to avoid highways when possible until police make an arrest. A 66-year-old Kansas City, Kan., man who was shot at Saturday afternoon said he also plans to stick to streets and now carries a gun. In his case, he was eastbound on Interstate 670 downtown just west of the Interstate 35 exit when he heard a loud noise that he immediately recognized as gunfire. He noticed two cars nearby, one of them white. Two other victims also saw white cars near them when they were targeted. The 66-year-old couldnt safely pull over until he exited the highway. Thats when he saw the hole in his rear driver-side door. Its just somebody crazy, he said. Theyre either on drugs or lacking attention. I dont know. Another man shot at Saturday said a car with three to four occupants nearly barreled into him from an entrance ramp onto Interstate 49 near Red Bridge Road. He slammed on his brakes to avoid a collision, he said. The occupants waved their middle fingers at him and I saluted back, he said. An occupant then pointed a gun at him. The man said he showed the occupants that he, too, had a gun. The occupants braked and positioned themselves on the rear passenger side of his car. He took the ramp to Interstate 435, and the other men followed. At Bannister Road, after the other men exited, one of them fired a round at the victim. Although the incident involved some road rage, the victim said he thinks the incident fits the pattern of the other shootings. These guys were up to no good, he said. They just took me completely by surprise when they nearly hit me. I think they were trying to cause an incident. One of the guys was looking at me like, I got you,  he said. The Star isnt naming the victims for their protection. ||||| Kansas City drivers on edge over highway shootings Posted: Wednesday, April 9, 2014 5:14 PM EDT Updated: Friday, May 9, 2014 5:14 PM EDT Since news spread that someone was shooting at cars on the highways in the Kansas City area, drivers have been on edge.

And until a suspect is caught, drivers say they aren't taking any chances. Some are finding alternate routes, others say they aren't going to stop their regular routines. \\"A little uneasy. It's unaimed, not targeted. You don't know who they are shooting at. It could be anybody,\\" Ashley Quinn said. Many of the multiple shootings have occurred near Three Trails Crossing, what was known for years as the Grandview Triangle. Shots were fired as drivers were exiting or entering ramps onto the highways. Some drivers say they are now taking different routes to avoid the highway. \\"I'll go out Longview Road, or take a different route,\\" Gaynell Thomas said. Others, like Donna Sover, have been staying in at night. Students who enter the busy highway merger take that route daily to Longview Community College. It is now a topic of discussion. \\"They either don't want to come to school or take different routes to school,\\" Kelsey Lohmeyer said. For Marvin Ramirez, he has been mainly taking the back roads to get to school. Still, others say their routines will not change. \\"I just watch the roads, watch the ramps but as far as changing my route, no I'm not doing that,\\" Connie Alicie said. For Winetta Nevins, she will take the same route. \\"...just believe I am protected by God,\\" she said. Copyright 2014 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)

Article: Exercise is one of the few factors with a positive role in long-term control of body weight. Unfortunately, that message has not gotten through to the average American, who would rather try switching to \\"light\\" beer and low-calorie bread than increase physical efforts. The Centers for Disease Control, for example, found that fewer than one-fourth of overweight adults who were trying to lose weight said they were combining exercise with their diet. In rejecting exercise, some people may be discouraged too much by caloric-expenditure charts; for example, one would have to quickly walk hard three miles just to work off the 275 calories in one delicious Danish pastry . Even exercise professionals accept half a point here. \\"Exercise by itself is a very tough way to lose weight,\\" says York Onnen, program director of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. Still, exercise's supporting role in weight reduction is vital. A study at the Boston University Medical Center of overweight police officers and other public employees confirmed that those who dieted without exercise regained almost all their old weight, while those who worked exercise into their daily routine maintained their new weight. If you have been sedentary and decide to start walking one mile a day, the added exercise could burn an extra 100 calories daily. In a year's time, assuming no increase in food intake, you could lose ten pounds. By increasing the distance of your walks gradually and making other dietary adjustments, you may lose even more weight. Question: \\"Even exercise professionals accept half a point here\\" means \\"They _ \\". Options: A: agree that the calories in a small piece of pastry can be easy to work off by exercise B: partially believe diet plays a supporting role in weight reduction C: are not fully convinced that dieting can help maintain one's new weight D: are not sufficiently informed of the positive role of exercise in losing weight The answer is:","completion":"B: partially believe diet plays a supporting role in weight reduction"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Enemies of the People Movie plot: An estimated 1.7 million Cambodians died during the rule of the Khmer Rouge, a radical communist movement led by Pol Pot. Among the victims were Thet Sambathâs mother, father and brother. He says he did not understand why the Khmer Rouge unleashed such violence on their compatriots. In 1999, he decided to seek confessions and explanations from former Khmer Rouge officials at all levels. None had previously admitted any killings.[1] In 2001, he met Nuon Chea, Pol Potâs deputy, also known as Brother Number Two. Nuon Chea was then living as a private citizen in Prum, a small town on the Thai-Cambodian border. Sambath visited Nuon Chea most weekends for around three years.[2] During that time, Nuon Chea was willing to talk about all phases of his political career except the three-and-a-half years of the Khmer Rouge regime. He had previously been interviewed by Western and Japanese journalists but had always denied responsibility for killing anyone in the Cambodian genocide. In 2004, Nuon Chea made his first admission to Sambath concerning decisions to kill that he made with Pol Pot.[3] Sambath continued to interview Nuon Chea on his role in the Killing Fields for three more years. During that time the United Nations-backed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) was constituted to investigate the alleged crimes of Democratic Kampuchea. Sambath interviewed Nuon Chea until September 2007 when the latter was arrested and charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity by the ECCC. During the same period, Sambath also built up a network of less senior former Khmer Rouge officials and cadres who were prepared to acknowledge and detail their role in the Killing Fields.[4] The film focuses on two Khmer Rouge perpetrators in the northwest of Cambodia. Khoun and Suon take Sambath to the scene of their massacres and introduce him to their superior officer, a woman known as Sister âEmâ.

Christabel proves to be a scheming, socially ambitious woman. She flirts with Donna's fiance, the wealthy Curtis Carey, at a party for Donna's friend, painter Gabriel Broome. She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money. Christabel then turns around and cunningly does the same to Curtis by convincing him to propose a pre-nuptial agreement. Donna is offended and the couple break up, which turns out to have been Christabel's plan all along. With Curtis now available, Christabel rebuffs a marriage proposal from Nick, whose novel is about to be published by Caine.

This sentence agrees with the statement, so it's not the answer. 2. She was just a girl and twenty years older than Callie.

The CIA's senior management saw problems with the armed Predator as well, problems that Clarke and even Black and Allen were inclined to minimize. One (which also applied to reconnaissance flights) was money. A Predator cost about 3 million. If the CIA flew Predators for its own reconnaissance or covert action purposes, it might be able to borrow them from the Air Force, but it was not clear that the Air Force would bear the cost if a vehicle went down. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz took the position that the CIA should have to pay for it; the CIA disagreed. Second, Tenet in particular questioned whether he, as Director of Central Intelligence, should operate an armed Predator.\\" This was new ground,\\"he told us. Tenet ticked off key questions: What is the chain of command? Who takes the shot? Are America's leaders comfortable with the CIA doing this, going outside of normal military command and control? Charlie Allen told us that when these questions were discussed at the CIA, he and the Agency's executive director, A. B.\\" Buzzy\\" Krongard, had said that either one of them would be happy to pull the trigger, but Tenet was appalled, telling them that they had no authority to do it, nor did he. Third, the Hellfire warhead carried by the Predator needed work. It had been built to hit tanks, not people. It needed to be designed to explode in a different way, and even then had to be targeted with extreme precision. In the configuration planned by the Air Force through mid-2001, the Predator's missile would not be able to hit a moving vehicle. White House officials had seen the Predator video of the \\"man in white.\\" On July 11, Hadley tried to hurry along preparation of the armed system. He directed McLaughlin, Wolfowitz, and Joint Chiefs Vice Chairman Richard Myers to deploy Predators capable of being armed no later than September 1.

The tenements of the Old Town and the Georgian buildings of the New Town are still in residential use, which means they have not been condemned and are being maintained for people to live in. Moreover, not only are these old buildings serving as residences, but they also support a bustling community, as a range of stores, restaurants, pubs, and theaters are open to cater to the needs and interests of the population. This further demonstrates that these historical structures continue to be functional and valuable to the people living there today. Rather than being condemned, it seems that the Old Town and New Town have managed to preserve their architectural heritage and charm while accommodating modern lifestyles and providing essential services and amenities to their residents.

Context: One day after a mass shooting killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his support for a plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said. But a recent Brookings Institution survey found Americans are far more welcoming of refugees than the billionaire candidate. Of those surveyed, 59 percent support accepting refugees, while 41 percent oppose it. Those views are split right down party lines, with just 38 percent of Republicans supporting taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared to 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. The Obama administration has set a goal of admitting as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees to the United States by the fall.Respondents of the surveys also were sharply divided on whether they would be willing to accept refugees from Syria in particular, with 61 percent of Republicans saying the U.S. should not accept Syrian refugees, compared to 27 percent of Democrats.

Answer: Answer:","completion":"After the end of the story, Trump probably limits severely immigration from Muslim countries. In the context provided, Trump expresses support for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and aims to suspend immigration from areas with a proven history of terrorism against the U.S., Europe, or its allies. He suggests that immigrants from the Middle East can potentially radicalize people who are already in the U.S. or convince them through online networks.

A:","completion":"A: Marks and Spencer, also known as M&S, first opened on September 28, 1884. The company was founded by Michael Marks, a Polish-born immigrant, who initially set up a small market stall in Kirkgate Market, Leeds, United Kingdom. At the time, he mainly sold household goods, such as soap, curtain rings, and cleaning products. In 1894, Michael Marks and Thomas Spencer, a bookkeeper, became business partners, and the name Marks and Spencer was created. They opened their first store in a covered arcade in Leeds called the Cross Arcade, positioning the business as a penny bazaar. It was a small store that aimed to serve the needs of ordinary families, offering a wide range of merchandise, from clothing and haberdashery products to tinware and cutlery, all at a low price point. The store was founded with the slogan \\"Don't ask the price, it's a penny,\\" summarizing their commitment to affordability. The partnership between Marks and Spencer proved successful as the business expanded throughout the early 20th century. They opened new stores, not only in different parts of the United Kingdom but also in Ireland and overseas, with their first international store opening in Paris in 1928. At the same time, the company introduced new products such as food, which eventually became one of their biggest revenue sources. Marks and Spencer also pioneered several innovative concepts in retail throughout their growth, such as the introduction of pre-packed perishable food along with the cash and carry service in the 1930s. This innovativeness continued into the 1950s when they became one of the first retailers to offer high-quality, ready-to-wear clothes with their \\"St Michael\\" brand. They embraced various other up-and-coming ideas like self-service, in-store cafeterias, and the first escalators in a British shop, all of which contributed to making M&S the successful retail brand it is today. To this day, Marks and Spencer remains one of the leading retail chains in the United Kingdom, with an extensive range of products, including clothing, food, and homeware. The company has evolved over the years, embracing e-commerce and expanding its presence around the globe, all while maintaining its dedication to quality and affordable products for its customers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who suffered a heart attack at a concert after singing her hit song \\"Pata Pata\\"? Following growing pressure from the anti-apartheid movement both domestically and internationally, in 1990 State President Frederik Willem de Klerk reversed the ban on the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison. Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990. Makeba, Gillespie, Simone, and Masekela recorded and released her studio album, Eyes on Tomorrow, in 1991. It combined jazz, R&B, pop, and traditional African music, and was a hit across Africa. Makeba and Gillespie then toured the world together to promote it. In November she made a guest appearance on a US sitcom, The Cosby Show. In 1992, she starred in the film Sarafina!, which centred on students involved in the 1976 Soweto uprising. Makeba portrayed the title character's mother, Angelina, a role which The New York Times described as having been performed with \\"immense dignity\\".On 16 October 1999, Makeba was named a Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In January 2000, her album, Homeland, produced by the New York City based record label Putumayo World Music, was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best World Music Album category. She worked closely with Graça Machel-Mandela, the South African first lady, advocating for children suffering from HIV/AIDS, child soldiers, and the physically handicapped. She established the Makeba Centre for Girls, a home for orphans, described in an obituary as her most personal project. She also took part in the 2002 documentary Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony, which examined the struggles of black South Africans against apartheid through the music of the period. Makeba's second autobiography, Makeba: The Miriam Makeba Story, was published in 2004. In 2005 she announced that she would retire and began a farewell tour, but despite having osteoarthritis, continued to perform...

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Kids Context: In mid-90s Manhattan, the nihilistic Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) is busy deflowering virgins. He doesn't just enjoy the sex and act of taking young girl's virginity though -- he believes that he can avoid STDs this way. After finishing with his latest conquest (Sarah Henderson), Telly bums around town with his friend Casper (Justin Pierce) looking for some kind of distraction .One of Telly's former sex partners, Jennie (Chloë Sevigny), and her friend Ruby (Rosario Dawson) receive mixed news at a public health clinic. The promiscuous Ruby is clean, but Jennie (who has only had sex once, with Telly) is HIV positive. The news devastates Jennie, who will spend much of the film searching for the wandering Telly.Telly & Casper have several adventures: buying weed in the park, shoplifting a \\"40\\" of malt liquor from a Korean Guy (Johnathan Staci Kim) of whom they make fun of, beating up a man who \\"disses\\" them, and finally winding up at a teen party that night. Eventually we find that Telly has seduced a thirteen year old girl, and is busy deflowering her. Jennie (who took a strange drug earlier) arrives and passes out on a couch. A drunken Casper takes advantage of the situation to rape Jennie, perpetuating the HIV cycle.The audience can hear Telly's voice-over explaining that without sex, his life has no purpose. The film finishes with Casper waking up the following morning and asking to no-one in particular, \\"Jesus Christ, what has happened?\\" Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Kids,\\" Jennie, played by Chloë Sevigny, tests positive for HIV after only having had sex once, with Telly.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: The virus \\"Ebola\\" is named after the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That's where the virus was discovered in 1976. A person can only get Ebola through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, for example, sweat or spit. Additionally, the virus can get into your body through your eyes and mouth if those areas come into contact with something that contains the bodily fluids of an infected person. That's why health care workers are supposed to keep themselves completely covered while treating patients. The deadliest Ebola outbreak is spreading fast in Western Africa, taking over 900 lives so far. The health systems in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are severely lacking in resources, and health care workers may not have access to adequate protective clothing when working in rural clinics, where the proper protections are lacking. Since Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia share a border; it's easier for people to move from one country to another, increasing the risk for disease spread. For now, all doctors can do is treat the symptoms and provide supportive care like monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing while making sure the patients' fluids are supplied. Sometimes patients are given antibiotics to treat other possible infections. The hope is to make the patient pull through the infection so their immune system can eventually clear the virus. The people who survive Ebola have created enough antibodies to kill it. There are several promising drugs and vaccines in development, but since Ebola is less common--and research about it is not well funded -- there is no drug or vaccine that has been approved for use in humans. Many of the other drugs and vaccines have not yet been tested in humans. The WHO (World Health Organization) is meeting next week to discuss whether experimental treatments should be used during this outbreak. Question: Why have there been no cures used for Ebola in humans so far? Options: A: There are not enough drugs for the infected people. B: Ebola is rare and its research money is lacking. C: The people have enough antibodies to kill Ebola. D: The WHO has decided not to use them. A:","completion":"The best answer is B: Ebola is rare and its research money is lacking. The text mentions that there are several promising drugs and vaccines in development for Ebola; however, due to a lack of funding, these experimental treatments have not yet been approved for use in humans. The scarcity of the disease also likely contributes to the lack of investment in research. This option is directly supported by the text making it the most accurate answer. Although other options might also be indirectly derived from the text, Option B is the most accurate reflection of the content in the article."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For extra texture, use puff paint which dries in a bubble-like form above the surface of the bead. To make your beads sparkly, use glitter glue or loose glitter over the surface of the paper. Add the glitter before your final coat of varnish to keep it from rubbing off as a result of wear and tear. Try adding several coats of glitter in different colors for a lovely rainbow effect.

In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said.

In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, \\"He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart.\\" When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\" on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: Early Seventies Britain was a very depressing place. It was completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike.

The UK is high up in the list of places that the Chinese want to visit. There is a sense of mystery about the UK; it's often the images of England's green parks, countryside and Victorian houses that people point to as an alternative to polluted, overcrowded cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou. The capital is viewed as modern and dynamic, while being filled deep with history. When asked what other images are thought of by the UK, the reply is often \\"the Queen, tea and Oxbridge\\". So what's stopping them actually coming? Sebastian Wood ,the British ambassador in Beijing, has described the UK as a _ , and while this is perhaps an exaggeration ,Britain does have a reputation as a country that is harder to access. The main problem for Chinese tourists is obvious. Although visa applications are now completed online, visitors are still required to visit one of 12 UK centers across the country for a face-to-face interview and fingerprinting. If you don't live near one of these enters already, you'd have to travel some distance to get there. Another problem is also to be mentioned. If travelers from China visit the UK, they also want to cover as much ground as possible. But the UK is not included in the Schengen visa, which allows access to a host of 26 European countries such as France and Germany. So it makes the former seem a less worth it. There is also the issue of cost: PS47 for a Schengen visa, PS82 for the UK. On top of this, the UK is viewed as stricter in its handing of visas compared with the rest of Europe, fed by urban legends of rejected applications. In the end, the decision comes down to one question: Is Britain worth a visit? What is the writer's attitude towards visiting the UK? A) He really supports Chinese people to visit the UK. B) He suggests Chinese people visit London strongly. C) He thinks it is troublesome to visit the UK. D) He believes everyone should go to see the Queen and Oxbridge. The answer is:","completion":"C) He thinks it is troublesome to visit the UK. Step-by-step justification: 1. Analyze the question: The question asks about the writer's attitude towards visiting the UK. 2. Read the passage carefully: The passage describes the UK as an attractive destination for Chinese tourists, but it also mentions several barriers that make visiting the UK more difficult. 3. Identify relevant details: The text outlines the visa application process, the additional effort required by Chinese visitors compared to visiting other European countries, the higher cost of the UK visa, and the perception of stricter visa approval. 4. Compare the answer choices: A) He really supports Chinese people to visit the UK. - This answer is not accurate, as the writer highlights the difficulties and challenges of visiting the UK. B) He suggests Chinese people visit London strongly. - This answer is too specific and does not convey the writer's overall attitude. C) He thinks it is troublesome to visit the UK. - This answer reflects the writer's attitude by mentioning the challenges and difficulties Chinese visitors may face when planning a trip to the UK. D) He believes everyone should go to see the Queen and Oxbridge. - This answer is irrelevant to the writer's attitude towards visiting the UK. 5.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Jan went and played hard to help her team out. Given the context: How would Jan feel afterwards? Possible answers: very helping, like she wasn't wanted, like her efforts were wasted","completion":"Based on the context given, it is not explicitly stated how Jan would feel afterwards. However, by making certain inferences, it is most likely that she would feel tired but fulfilled and satisfied for having given her all to assist her team. She had “played hard” which probably indicates that she put her heart and soul into her efforts to make a positive impact on her team. Such dedication and commitment typically inspire feelings of accomplishment. This is because she intended to \\"help her team out,\\" and even if they didn’t win, she has the satisfaction of knowing she did her best. Therefore, it's very unlikely she feels ‘like she wasn't wanted’ or that ‘her efforts were wasted’. These feelings are generally associated with a lack of acknowledgment or appreciation of one’s efforts, which the given context doesn't suggest. We had zero input that hints towards a lack of appreciation or acknowledgment towards Jan. Hence, neither of these two options seems to be a possibility. So, feelings such as being 'very helping' would probably be closest to what Jan might be experiencing. However, the more suitable word to use here would be ‘helpful’. 'Helping' is generally not used to describe feelings. But regardless of semantics, the overarching feeling for Jan, in this case, is likely one of satisfaction and fulfillment derived from her perceived contribution to her team. In summary, Jan, having worked hard to support her team, would most likely feel exhausted but satisfied, knowing she had made a considerable effort to assist her team. This sense of fulfillment may also be coupled with feelings of being helpful and accomplished. It’s important to note that these are inferences drawn from the presented context, and Jan’s actual feelings could depend on a multitude of factors including her personality, the team's reaction, and the outcome of whatever situation they were in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? over his head","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"over his head,\\" we must first analyze its meaning within the context it was likely used and then make an educated judgment on whether it implies a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The phrase \\"over his head\\" typically means that the person is unable to handle or comprehend the situation, task, or responsibility due to its complexity or difficulty. When used in the context of a movie review, this phrase could refer to an actor giving a performance where they appear to be overwhelmed or out of their depth in a particular role. It could also refer to a director being unable to manage the different aspects of a film, ultimately leading to a less-than-stellar outcome. Considering the general interpretation of the phrase, it's safe to assume that \\"over his head\\" is most likely conveying a negative sentiment. This is because the reviewer must have felt that the actor or director was struggling to deliver a credible work in their respective roles. Their inability to manage and fulfill the tasks at hand must have dampened the viewer's enjoyment or appreciation of the film. However, it's essential to note that the overall sentiment of the statement could be influenced by the remainder of the review. For instance, if other aspects of the movie are praised, the sentiment may be slightly more positive, despite the negativity conveyed by the phrase \\"over his head.\\" In conclusion, the movie review sentence \\"over his head,\\" when analyzed within its likely context, implies a primarily negative sentiment. This is due to the notion that the actor or director was unable to handle the complexity or requirements of their role, which led to a diminished experience for the viewer. However, the overall sentiment could be modified by the rest of the review, as other positive aspects of the movie might still be present."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sean Patrick Hannity was born in New York City, New York, the son of Lillian (Flynn) and Hugh Hannity. Lillian worked as a stenographer and a corrections officer at a county jail, while Hugh was a family-court officer. He is the youngest of four siblings. All of his grandparents immigrated to the United States from Ireland. Hannity hosted his first talk radio show in 1989 at the volunteer college station at UC Santa Barbara, KCSB-FM, while working as a general contractor. The show aired for 40 hours of air time. Regarding his first show, he said, \\"I wasn't good at it. I was terrible.\\" Hannity's weekly show on KCSB was canceled after less than a year. This was after two shows featuring the book The AIDS Coverup: The Real and Alarming Facts about AIDS by Gene Antonio; among other remarks made during the broadcast, Hannity told a lesbian caller, \\"I feel sorry for your child.\\" The university board that governed the station later reversed its decision due to a campaign conducted on Hannity's behalf by the Santa Barbara chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued that the station had discriminated against Hannity's First Amendment rights. When the station refused to give him a public apology and more airtime, Hannity decided against returning to KCSB. After leaving KCSB, Hannity placed an ad in radio publications presenting himself as \\"the most talked about college radio host in America.\\" Radio station WVNN in Athens, Alabama (part of the Huntsville market), then hired him to be the afternoon talk show host. From Huntsville, he moved to WGST in Atlanta in 1992, filling the slot vacated by Neal Boortz, who had moved to competing station WSB. In September 1996, Fox News co-founder Roger Ailes hired the then relatively unknown Hannity to host a television program under the working title Hannity and LTBD (\\"liberal to be determined\\"). Alan Colmes was then hired to co-host and the show debuted as Hannity & Colmes. Later that year, Hannity left WGST for New York, where WABC had him substitute for their afternoon drive time host during Christmas week. In January 1997, WABC put Hannity on the air full-time, giving him the late night time slot. WABC then moved Hannity to the same drive time slot he had filled temporarily a little more than a year earlier. Hannity was on WABC's afternoon time slot from January 1998 until the end of 2013. Since January 2014, Hannity has hosted the 3-6 p.m. time slot on WOR in New York City. In their 2007 book Common Ground: How to Stop the Partisan War That Is Destroying America, conservative Cal Thomas and liberal Bob Beckel describe Hannity as a leader of the pack among broadcasting political polarizers, which following James Q.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Who disagreed with Reagan's proposed changes to Executive Order 11246?\\" is in \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts.

Writing out each step when solving a problem is also a way to help you understand each part of the process required. Writing out steps is a good habit to pick up and maintain. Also, when you’re doing practice problems or taking notes, write out each step. You’ll be glad you did when it comes time for applying steps on the test! Give problem sets careful attention, and do more for practice, if you need it. Even when you’ve found the solution to a math problem, you may not be finished. Take the solution and plug it back into the original problem to see if it’s the correct answer. Word problems are applied math, where you’re given a situation and have to find the right way to solve an associated problem. Since you have to both understand the situation and the necessary math concepts, this type of problem can be especially tricky. Read through the entire problem before you begin to solve it. Make sure you understand the situation and what math techniques you’ll need to use. Some problems may have associated graphs, charts, or tables. Make sure to read those carefully, too. Select the numbers you’ll need to use to solve the problem. Keep in mind that some word problems might have unneeded details designed to make you use your understanding of what you need to solve it. After you’ve solved the problem, make sure to check your work steps and see whether your answer makes sense in its size and is in the correct units, etc. Your teacher assigns a certain number of problems for homework, but if you don’t feel like you fully understand, you might need to study more problems. Look for extra practice sets in your textbook or online, and try some of those until you feel more confident. Often times, the answers to all the odd-numbered problems are in the back of the book. Do the odd-numbered problem, check your answer, and, once you're confident you know how to do it, then do the even-numbered problem next to it. If you’re anxious about taking an exam, do one or more practice ones ahead of time. Try to recreate the test environment--keep your study room quiet, and avoid interruptions. Check your work after taking the practice test, and study more if you need it. Ask your teacher if there are practice versions of tests you can use for study.

For some reason today hes very curious about the things that he sees. He looks around as hes driving and the street lights catch his attention. He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside. Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb? Hint: A vapor light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting.

Combine the terms with c together: (-684 - 363) * c - 10470 = 0 2. Calculate the combined number for c: -1047 * c - 10470 = 0 3. Add 10470 to both sides to isolate the term with c: -1047 * c = 10470 4. Finally, divide both sides by -1047 to find the value of c: c = 10470 / -1047 Now let's do the math! c = -10 So, the solution to the equation is c = -10.

Inside, he is startled by a young woman who claims she is a prisoner and begs for his help. Dracula then appears to greet Harker and guide him to his room, where he locks him in. Jonathan starts to write in his diary, and his true intentions are revealed: he is a vampire hunter and has come to kill Dracula. John Van Eyssen as Jonathan Harker. Freed sometime later, Harker again is confronted by the desperate woman. She begs him for help but then bites his neck. Just as she does, Dracula â fangs bared and lips bloody â arrives and pulls her away. When he awakens in daylight, Harker finds the bite mark. He hides his journal in a shrine to the Virgin Mary outside the castle and descends into the crypt, where he finds Dracula and the vampire woman resting in their coffins. Armed with a stake, he impales the woman, who, as he looks on, immediately ages from young to old. Whilst he does this, the sun sets, and when he turns to Dracula's coffin with the intention of killing the vampire, he finds it empty.

Here is a premise: \\"A group of people sit on and in front of a graffiti covered wall.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"A group of people sit around a painted wall.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise \\"A group of people sit on and in front of a graffiti covered wall\\" does provide some information to consider the hypothesis \\"A group of people sit around a painted wall.\\" However, it does not give us enough information to definitively confirm or deny the entire hypothesis. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis into smaller components and analyze them to understand why. First, let's consider the premise: \\"A group of people sit on and in front of a graffiti covered wall.\\" This statement provides us with three key pieces of information: 1. There is a group of people. 2. The wall is covered with graffiti. 3. The people are sitting either on or in front of the wall. Next, let's look at the hypothesis: \\"A group of people sit around a painted wall.\\" This statement also provides three key pieces of information: 1. There is a group of people. 2. The wall is painted. 3. The people are sitting around the wall. Comparing the details provided by the premise and the hypothesis, we can identify the following overlaps and discrepancies: 1. Both the premise and the hypothesis mention a group of people. This fact is consistent in both statements. 2. When considering the state of the wall, the premise mentions the wall is covered with graffiti, while the hypothesis states the wall is painted. While it is plausible to infer that graffiti is a form of paint, the intent behind the two descriptions may not be the same. Graffiti typically refers to drawings, writings, or designs that are done illicitly on a wall, whereas a painted wall could refer to a legally-painted, intended design, or even a plain painted wall. So, while it is possible that the graffiti-covered wall mentioned in the premise and the painted wall mentioned in the hypothesis could be referring to the same wall, we cannot confirm this with certainty based on the given information. 3. The premise states that the people are sitting either on or in front of the wall, while the hypothesis suggests that the people are sitting around the wall. Sitting \\"around\\" a wall could imply that the people are not only sitting in front of the wall but also possibly behind or to the sides of the wall. The difference in the description of where the people are sitting further complicates the ability to confirm or deny the hypothesis based on the premise provided. In conclusion, although there is some overlap between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot definitively determine the truth of the hypothesis based solely on the premise. The information provided in the premise does not give us enough clarity about the state of the wall and the exact positioning of the people to confirm or reject the hypothesis as true or false."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The legal action is aiming to establish the drivers with worker status, rather than as self-employed customers or partners - which is how Uber sees them. The first four cases were lodged last week, arguing the company is breaching its duty on basic rights. Uber says most of its drivers want the flexibility its approach offers. Drivers pay a fee to use the Uber technology. When a job comes up the nearest driver is offered it, otherwise it goes to the next person. For this, Uber takes a fee of 20%, soon to rise to 25% for new drivers. Employment lawyer Nigel Mackay, who is representing the drivers, said Uber was not complying with employment law. Watch Jim Reed's film about Uber here. \\"What we want to do is try and ensure these drivers get workers' rights, the rights that anyone who works is entitled to. Things like minimum wage, the right to paid holiday,\\" he said. He added that the ways in which Uber controlled its drivers - including the provision of initial training, guides as to which routes to take and requirements for minimum hours - meant they were not just self-employed. Mr Mackay said there were also serious health and safety issues as currently Uber did not ensure its drivers take rest breaks or work a maximum number of hours per week. \\"A lot of these workers work 50, 60, 70 hours per week - they should be entitled to paid time off for doing that work,\\" he said. \\"I think it's true that there's a real risk to health and safety if drivers are being pushed by circumstance to drive these long hours - because they are not sitting in an office, it is a potentially dangerous job.\\" James Farrar has worked for Uber since last December. \\"I joined because I was working on a start-up so I needed the flexibility to work when I wanted, while having the remainder free for research and writing. The flexibility with Uber is really great. \\"The only problem is that when you're not working you're not earning and your earnings are so much lower than I expected. It's really starting to bite now. \\"It's more difficult to make money than six months ago. There's a certain amount of money [I want to be earning] each day and I just need to stay out longer and longer to earn it. \\"My average pay in July was £5.03 an hour, well below the minimum wage. So if you want to cover your costs and keep the family afloat, you've got to work a lot of hours. \\"I wouldn't want to be picked up myself by somebody who has worked 18 hours a day. Since we are self-employed, Uber does not take responsibility for that occupational risk. \\"I could get another job, but Uber has so aggressively come into the market, the chances of working for other operators are rapidly evaporating.\\" GMB, the union that represents professional drivers, has instructed Leigh Day to take the action on behalf of its members driving for Uber. The first cases were submitted to the London Central Employment Tribunal. The law firm says it will be submitting further claims and will be asking the tribunal to hear them all together. Uber describes itself as a \\"fully licenced\\" service that connects potential passengers with a background-checked private driver and takes a cut - typically 20% - of the fee. It currently operates in 10 cities in the UK. It had 7,000 drivers in London in 2014, a number which has risen to 20,000 this year. Uber says the drivers are self-employed not workers and therefore and therefore they do not have to guarantee them a minimum wage. Uber's regional general manager, Jo Bertram, said most of its drivers had moved from traditional jobs with prescribed shifts as they wanted the flexibility Uber's approach offered. \\"The fact you can work literally whenever you want, spend time with kids, you can build business on the side. That's the flexibility the majority of Uber drivers are looking for,\\" she said. She added the company looked at how much money the drivers took home very carefully. \\"What we find is drivers using the app actually take home around £15 or £16 an hour. Obviously their costs vary hugely depending on whether they rent or own and a number of other factors, but the majority are actually making around £10/12 per hour even after costs.\\" The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel. This article was about:","completion":"The article talks about a potential legal action against the ridesharing company Uber, concerning the employment status of its drivers. The legal action aims to categorize Uber drivers as workers, contrasting with Uber’s characterization of their drivers as self-employed customers or partners. The first four cases have already been filed, with the claim that Uber is failing to uphold the fundamental rights of its drivers. Uber asserts that its drivers prefer the flexibility it provides. The drivers pay a fee to access Uber's technology, and for every job completed, Uber takes a fee of 20%, which is soon set to increase to 25% for new drivers. The drivers are represented by employment attorney Nigel Mackay, who argues that Uber is out of compliance with employment law. Among other things, he asserts that due to the level of control exerted by Uber over its drivers – including trainings, route suggestions, and setting minimum hours – the drivers should be seen as something more than just self-employed. Mr. Mackay also raises safety concerns, as he alleges that Uber does not mandate its drivers to take breaks or restrict their working hours. He warns of the potential hazards associated with this, saying that many drivers end up working over 50 hours a week without rest. James Farrar, an Uber driver since the previous December, also expresses his dissatisfaction with the pay, stating that earnings have been significantly lower than anticipated. In July, his average pay was £5.03/hour, which is significantly below the minimum wage. The GMB Union, which represents professional drivers, has directed the law firm Leigh Day to address these concerns on behalf of Uber drivers. Initial claims have been filed with the London Central Employment Tribunal. The law firm plans to submit further claims and request for their collective adjudication. Uber, however, contends that its drivers are self-employed and not workers, and hence it isn't obligated to assure them a minimum wage. Jo Bertram, Uber's Regional General Manager, says that most of their drivers appreciate the flexibility Uber offers. In an attempt to mitigate criticisms about the drivers’ earnings, she adds that on average, drivers earn around £15 or £16 per hour before costs.

The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Amid all the chaos and confusion of Rep. Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal, somehow Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred got connected with one of the New York Democrat's female electronic correspondents. And today, the pair opted to call a news conference in New York to announce that they would really like to avoid publicity and get on with their private lives. Because Weiner has refrained from publicly texting his whereabouts and desires the last couple of days, times were slow on the power/sex news front. So, fewer than several hundred news media showed up at the Friars Club to watch the shy women enter down a spiral staircase. Weiner's texting partner is a Tennessean known as Ginger Lee. She is a former porn actress and what Allred calls a \\"featured dancer,\\" who is studying to become a real estate agent and likes long walks on the beac h. We made up that last part. Lee carefully read a written statement (see video below). Mainly, in her attempt to duck publicity, Lee said she had not responded in kind to Weiner's suggestive sexts but had continued exchanging maybe 100 messages since March, mostly about politics, she said. And especially about the managed care opt-out for certain states that obtain healthcare waivers by the deadline set out in Section 14 (v). We made up that last part again. Lee said the married Democrat would often steer their political exchanges toward sexual subjects, one time proudly texting her: \\"I have wardrobe demands too. I need to highlight my package.\\" We did not make up that last part. Lee also said that Weiner, who apparently got her phone number somehow, called when the scandal began to urge her to lie about their relationship. She said she became disturbed when she saw the New York representative lie on national television about the photo of a brief-covered package that Weiner originally said was sent from his Twitter account by a hacker. Lee said she wanted to get on with her regular life. Somehow, shortly after the news conference, word leaked that Lee was off the unemployment line and would be uncovering her package tonight at an Atlanta strip club. Weiner has since admitted lying about the hacker and numerous other things during these three years of explicit online exchanges with a half-dozen women who are not his wife. Wife Huma Abedin returned from a lengthy Africa trip with her boss, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, early today. The 46-year-old Weiner is on a two-week leave of absence allegedly receiving some kind of treatment for something and consulting with his wife on growing demands for his resignation after seven terms in the House. Even BlackBerry addict President Obama has weighed in on the titilating distractions of shower photos and explicit texts between a man and women he's never met. When asked about the fellow Democrat by NBC's Ann Curry, Obama said if he were in Weiner's towel, he would resign.

If I tell you that Solar panels absorb sunlight. , and ask you the question \\"what absorbs sunlight? \\", is the correct answer \\"organic molecules\\"?","completion":"While organic molecules can absorb sunlight, the correct answer based on the statement you provided – \\"Solar panels absorb sunlight.\\" – would be \\"solar panels.\\" However, I can provide more context on both solar panels and organic molecules to help you better understand their roles in absorbing sunlight. Solar Panels: Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels, absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity. They are made up of solar cells, which contain semiconductor materials, typically silicon. When sunlight strikes the solar cell, the photons in sunlight transfer their energy to the atoms inside the semiconductor materials. This process, called the photovoltaic effect, causes the electrons in the semiconductor to move, creating an electric current. Organic Molecules: Organic molecules, meanwhile, are compounds that consist of carbon and hydrogen atoms bonded together and may include other elements such as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur. Both natural (e.g., chlorophyll in plants) and synthetic (e.g., organic solar cells) organic molecules are capable of absorbing sunlight. In the process of photosynthesis, chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and converts it to chemical energy that sustains plant growth and development. Organic solar cells, also called organic photovoltaics (OPVs), are an emerging type of solar cell technology made from organic materials. These cells have several benefits, including being flexible, lightweight, and relatively inexpensive to manufacture. Organic solar cells work by using organic molecules as the active layer that absorbs sunlight, generating electric currents through a process called exciton diffusion. However, their efficiency is currently lower than that of silicon-based solar cells. In summary, while organic molecules are indeed capable of absorbing sunlight, the correct answer based on your initial statement would be that \\"solar panels\\" absorb sunlight. Solar panels utilize silicon-based solar cells, whereas organic molecules can absorb sunlight in different contexts such as photosynthesis or organic photovoltaics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Bloody Mama Context: Young Kate Barker (Lisa Jill) is brutalized by her father and older brothers, who rape her. Thirty-five years later, the middle-aged Kate 'Ma' Barker (Shelley Winters) now brutalizes innocent people herself, while indulging her monstrous sexual appetites. She lives by robbing banks with her four sons; the pragmatic Arthur (Clint Kimbrough), the sadistic Herman (Don Stroud), the bisexual Fred (Robert Walden), and the loyal, drug-addicted Lloyd (Robert De Niro). It all begins in the late 1920s when Ma leaves her husband, George, and her Arkansas home and embarks on her own with her four sons on a robbery-murder spree to make her own fortune, while keeping them under a tight leash. When Herman and Fred are arrested and imprisoned for petty theft charges, Ma takes over the group and leads Arthur and Lloyd on a bank robbery spree to gain enough money to get her sons out of jail. The gang is joined by a gunman named Kevin (Bruce Dern) who was Fred's cellmate during his incarceration (and his strongly implied lover). The group is also joined by a local prostitute named Mona Gibson, whom Herman frequented before his imprisonment. The gang resorts to more violent action and robberies. While hiding out at a cabin in Kentucky, Lloyd comes across a young woman swimming at a nearby lake whom he sexually assaults. Not wanting the woman to report them to the police, the Barkers hold her captive and Ma eventually kills her by drowning her, despite the protests of her sons. Some time later, the gang arrives in Tennessee where they abduct a wealthy businessman named Sam Pendlebury (Pat Hingle). Holding him for a 300,000 ransom, the sons, particularly Herman, bond with their captive whom they see as the sympathetic father figure they never had. When Herman and Mona go to collect the ransom, they are chased by a pair of FBI agents and barely escape. When they find that the ransom is only half of what they originally demanded, Ma orders her sons to kill Sam rather than let him go. But none of them can bring themselves to do it...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The European space agency has unveiled the full image sequence of Philae's historic descent on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. The probe made its dramatic touchdown on 12 November while the comet was travelling at an incredible 34,000 mph (55,000 km per hour). This series of 19 images tracks the probe's seven hour journey as it fell 14 miles (22.5km) towards the comet's icy surface. Scroll down for video. The latest images were taken from Rosetta’s Osiris camera with the timestamp marked in GMT. Only a few frames of this image series had been made public previously. When Philae first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. While its precise location still remains unknown, early images suggest the probe landed with two legs on the ground and one pointing into space, which is severely limiting its access to sunlight. Since then the search has been on to identify it in higher-resolution images, but now that Rosetta has moved to a different orbit, and is further away from the comet, the chances of observing the lander are less. Previously, only a few frames of this image series had been made public. The latest images were taken from Rosetta’s Osiris camera with the timestamp marked in GMT. While its precise location still remains unknown, early images suggest the probe landed with two legs on the ground and one pointing into space, which is severely limiting its access to sunlight. It is shown here during the fifth stage of its descent. Controllers have now said they will simply wait for Philae to make contact with its mothership. Rosetta engineers in Darmstadt, Germany, will begin to monitor the feed in a few weeks' time and say there could be a chance the communication will be established in May or June. During these months, improved lighting conditions at the probe's assumed location could provide enough power to run the onboard radio transmitter. Radio tests on the probe just before it lost power have narrowed down its location to somewhere in a strip of terrain roughly 350m by 30m. Rosetta camera's scoured this location in early December, and each of its images were scanned by mission controllers to see if they could spot any pixels that were brighter than the rest. But Philae still couldn't be found. If Philae gets its power back, it would resume all science observations, which could take place in August, just when the comet is at its most active phase, according to a report by the BBC. In the meantime, the scientific haul from the comet continues as Rosetta continues its orbit around the icy body - and now illustrations have revealed amazing new details of the comet. An array of colours and diagrams highlight the gravitational field of the comet, thermal energy trapped between its cliffs and organic compounds on its surface. Scientists are hoping to answer many questions about this and other comets, including its formation, structure and evolution over time. Controllers have now said they will wait for Philae to make contact with its mothership. Philae is seen here on its seven-hour descent. When Philae first made contact, a few hours after this image was taken, it failed to fire harpoons causing it to bounce twice before landing. Using data from the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System (Osiris) and the Radio Science Investigation instrument, scientists have now been able to calculate the comet’s gravitational field. They have found that the gravitational force at the ‘lobes’ - the two ends of the comet - is about six times stronger than at the neck - the narrower area connecting the two lobes. It is still unknown whether the two-lobed shape of the comet is the result of two smaller bodies coming together, or if the neck has been ‘eaten’ away over time - like the core of an apple. Currently the latter theory is becoming the preferred explanation, as it appears the two lobes have similar structures – indicating they have the same origin. From this gravitational data scientists also found that comet’s density is about half that of water. Dr Holger Sierks from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, who was involved in the studies, told MailOnline that they now had a greater understanding of the comet's interior. Pictured is the current lander search area. Now that Rosetta has moved to a different orbit, and is further away from the comet, the chances of observing the lander are less, Rosetta engineers have said. The blurry image captures the rapid motion in which Philae was launched back out into space. The probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then to a much lower height of 65ft (20 metres) before coming to rest. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is showing signs of waking up early as it streaks towards the Sun at 47,800 mph (76,900 km/h). As it approaches the sun, the rubber duck-shaped lump of ice, dust and rock is expected to heat up and release more gas and water vapour from its interior. Comets are most active when they reach perihelion, the point in their orbit when they are closest to the Sun. But even at a distance of more than 200 million miles (320 million km), comet 67P is beginning to stir in dramatic fashion. Dr Dennis Bodewits, from the University of Maryland, US, who led one of several teams reporting latest findings from the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission in the journal Science, said: 'We are already seeing more activity. 'Jets are sprouting up everywhere. We've been surprised to see how active it is. It already has more jets than many other comets do at perihelion.' He said the interior is now thought to be analogous to 'ash, cigarette ash or super-dry powder snow.' Data from several instruments, meanwhile, has shown that the comet’s neck is the source of most of the dust and gas it is ejecting. The reason for this is quite interesting. Based on data, the Rosetta team found that the neck receives less energy than the rest of the comet because it is shaded. However, the two lobes either side trap radiation, with energy being ‘bounced’ between cliffs, causing the neck to be move active. The low gravitational pull of the neck also means that less force is needed to blow its dust and gas away than at the lobes. From the images and data, five basic - but diverse - categories of terrain type have been determined: dust-covered; brittle materials with pits and circular structures; large-scale depressions; smooth terrains; and more ‘rock-like’ surfaces. Much of the comet also appears to be covered in dust, as a result of dust that is dragged along by the comet falling to the surface over time. One prominent and intriguing feature is a 1,640ft (500m) long crack seen roughly parallel to the neck of the comet, running between its two larger lobes at either end. The biggest question remaining about the comet, though, is how it formed. Two predominant theories remain: either it is the result of two smaller bodies ‘sticking’ together, forming a single comet, or its central neck has been eaten away over time like the core of an apple. Rosetta is essentially living with the comet as it moves towards the sun along its orbit, learning how its behaviour changes on a daily basis and, over longer timescales, how its activity increases, how its surface may evolve, and how it interacts with the solar wind,’ said Esa Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor. ‘We have already learned a lot in the few months we have been alongside the comet, but as more and more data are collected and analysed from this close study of the comet we hope to answer many key questions about its origin and evolution.’ This graphic reveals the sequence of huge bounces before the Philae probe came to its final, unknown resting spot in November.

Finalement, la Cour a jugé que la notification de la sentence ou la déclaration d'exequatur dans le pays où la sentence avait été rendue n'était pas exigée pour la reconnaissance et l'exécution selon l'article 1061 du Code allemand de procédure civile (“ZPO”). Translate to English","completion":"In the end, the Court ruled that notification of the judgment or the declaration of enforceability in the country where the judgment had been rendered was not required for recognition and enforcement under Article 1061 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (\\"ZPO\\"). This decision by the Court essentially means that, in this particular case, the parties involved did not need to take additional steps to have the judgment recognized and enforced in the country where it was initially delivered. Article 1061 of the German Code of Civil Procedure outlines the specific requirements and procedures necessary for a foreign judgment to be recognized and enforced within Germany. With this ruling, the Court has indicated that the notification and declaration of enforceability in the originating country is not a mandatory requirement under these rules. In making this determination, the Court may have considered factors such as the nature of the judgment, the relevant laws of the countries involved, and any potential impact on international comity or public policy. By clarifying the interpretation of Article 1061, the Court has provided guidance not only for the parties involved in the case, but also for future parties dealing with similar cross-border recognition and enforcement matters. This ruling may encourage a more streamlined and efficient approach to international dispute resolution, as it simplifies the process for obtaining recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment. This could lead to faster resolution of disputes, reduced legal costs for the parties involved, and stronger cross-border legal cooperation. However, it is important to note that this is an interpretation of a specific provision within the German Code of Civil Procedure and may not necessarily apply universally or in other jurisdictions. For parties seeking recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, it is crucial to consult with experienced legal counsel who can navigate the complex web of international law and provide tailored guidance based on the unique circumstances of each case."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Уникальность системы – в отделении главного сервера, управляющего системой, от сервера показов , что означает отсутствие необходимости постоянного соединения между главным управляющим модулем и браузерами пользователей. Translate to English English:","completion":"The uniqueness of the system lies in the separation of the main server, which manages the system, from the display server, which means there is no need for a constant connection between the main control module and the users' browsers. In more detail, this unique system architecture offers a number of advantages that can improve efficiency, performance, and user experience. First and foremost, by separating the main server and the display server, the system can distribute the workload more effectively. The main server handles the administrative, management, and control-level tasks, while the display server focuses on delivering content to the end users' browsers. This division of labor allows for smoother system operations and reduces the likelihood of server crashes or slowdowns due to workload overload. Additionally, this separation minimizes the need for continuous communication between the main control module and users' browsers. As a result, the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and memory usage of the main server can be optimized. In turn, this can lead to improved system performance, faster response times, and an overall better user experience. Moreover, this unique system design enhances security by creating an additional layer of protection between the main server and the users' browsers. With the display server acting as a buffer, potential cyber threats and attacks are less likely to penetrate the main server. This design can then minimize system vulnerability and safeguard sensitive data and system integrity. Furthermore, a separate display server can potentially offer more flexibility in terms of content delivery, as it allows updates, modifications, and optimizations to be performed on the front-end without requiring the main server to be modified or taken offline. This could result in fewer service interruptions for users and a more seamless content delivery experience. In conclusion, the uniqueness of this system lies in its separation of the main server and the display server. This design not only contributes to improved performance, efficiency, and user experience, but it also supports enhanced security and flexibility within the system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Editors have so far released two platinum studio albums, and six in total, with several million combined sales. Their debut album After supporting bands such as Puressence and Oceansize, Editors released debut single \\"Bullets\\" recorded with producer Gavin Monaghan as a limited edition of 1000 copies on Kitchenware Records on 24 January 2005. The song had previously been played by BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Zane Lowe, where it earned the honour of 'Single of the Week'. The limited run then sold out on the day of its release, with copies famously then sold later in the week for more than PS30 on eBay. The release of \\"Munich\\" followed in April of that year and gave the band their first Top 25 hit, another sold out UK tour and a place on MTV's Spanking New Music show in Manchester. At this point, due to the band's increasing popularity, Editors and Kitchenware signed an exclusive distribution deal with Sony BMG. \\"Blood\\" was released two months later, reaching number 18 in the UK Singles Chart in its first week, selling 5,286 copies. With these releases their fanbase continued to grow and on 25 July 2005 their debut album The Back Room was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. In its first week, the album entered the charts at number 13, selling 17,627 copies. After re-issuing \\"Bullets\\" and achieving another Top 30 hit, Editors gained a high-profile support slot, supporting Franz Ferdinand in arenas across the UK and Europe. Editors then re-issued \\"Munich\\" in January 2006, selling one and half thousand more copies than the last time it was released. The song gave Editors their first Top 10 single and an appearance on Top of the Pops. With the single release, The Back Room also rose back up the album charts, peaking at number 2. It sold an additional 40,000 copies in the week of \\"Munich\\"'s release and went platinum in the process. A joint North American tour with Stellastarr* coincided with the American release of The Back Room in March 2006. It was released by Fader Label and sold 35,000 albums after 20 weeks. The band went on to play influential American festivals in 2006 such as Coachella and Lollapalooza. Editors proceeded to perform \\"Munich\\" on the American television show Late Night with Conan O'Brien.

Information: - A papal bull is a particular type of public decree, letters patent, or charter issued by a pope of the Roman Catholic Church. It is named after the lead seal (\\"bulla\\") that was traditionally appended to the end in order to authenticate it. - The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem was a crusader state established in the Southern Levant in 1099 after the First Crusade. The kingdom lasted nearly two hundred years, from 1099 until 1291 when the last remaining possession, Acre, was destroyed by the Mamluks, but its history is divided into two distinct periods. The sometimes so-called First Kingdom of Jerusalem lasted from 1099 to 1187, when it was almost entirely overrun by Saladin. After the subsequent Third Crusade, the kingdom was re-established in Acre in 1192, and lasted until that city's destruction in 1291. This second kingdom is sometimes called the Second Kingdom of Jerusalem or the Kingdom of Acre, after its new capital. - An-Nasir Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (/ ALA-LC: \\"al ad-Dn Ysuf ibn Ayyb\\"; / ALC-LC: \\"Selahedînê Eyûbî\\"), known as Saladin (1137 4 March 1193), was the first sultan of Egypt and Syria and the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. A Sunni Muslim of Kurdish origin, Saladin led the Muslim military campaign against the Crusader states in the Levant. At the height of his power, his sultanate included Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen and other parts of North Africa. - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God. - The Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem was a Roman Catholic military order founded by crusaders around 1119 at a leper hospital in Jerusalem , Kingdom of Jerusalem , whose care became its original purpose , named after patron saint Lazarus . It was recognised by King Fulk of Jerusalem in 1142 and canonically recognised as hospitaller and military order of chivalry under the rule of Saint Augustine in the Papal bull Cum a Nobis Petitur of Pope Alexander IV in 1255 . The titular seat was successively situated at Jerusalem , Saint - Jean - d'Acre and - after the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem - the Château Royal de Boigny - sur - Bionne in France . After several centuries , the order went into decline and ceased to perform its original functions after the French Revolution . In 1489 , Pope Innocent VIII attempted to merge the order and its land holdings with the Sovereign Military Order of Malta . This was resisted by the order in most countries where it still retained its premises . In 1572 , the Order of Saint Lazarus in Italy was merged with the Order of Saint Maurice under the Royal House of Savoy to form the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus , which still exists until today . In 1609 , King Henry IV of France linked it administratively to the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel to form the Royal Military and Hospitaller Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem united , which remained listed as of royal protection in the French Royal Almanac until 1830 . Its last living member admitted before the turmoil of the French Revolution died in 1856 . Notwithstanding , the revived Order of Saint Lazarus ( statuted 1910 ) claims legacy from the suppressed French branch under spiritual protection of the Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church , disputed by officials of the Roman Catholic Church . - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world. - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. - The First Crusade (10951099) was the first of a number of crusades that attempted to capture the Holy Land, called by Pope Urban II in 1095. It started as a widespread pilgrimage in western Christendom and ended as a military expedition by Roman Catholic Europe to regain the Holy Land taken in the Muslim conquests of the Levant (632661), ultimately resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Abrahamic religions, emphasizing and tracing their common origin to the tribal patriarch Abraham or recognizing a spiritual tradition identified with him, are one of the major divisions in comparative religion (along with Indian, Iranian, and East Asian religions). Judaism, Christianity and Islam are the largest Abrahamic religions in terms of numbers of adherents. - Mamluk (Arabic: \\"mamlk\\" (singular), \\"mamlk\\" (plural), meaning \\"property\\" , also transliterated as \\"mamlouk\\", \\"mamluq\\", \\"mamluke\\", \\"mameluk\\", \\"mameluke\\", \\"mamaluke\\" or \\"marmeluke\\") is an Arabic designation for slaves. The term is most commonly used to refer to Muslim slave soldiers and Muslim rulers of slave origin. - Abraham (Avraham), originally Abram, is the first of the three patriarchs of Judaism. His story features in the holy texts of all the Abrahamic religions and Abraham plays a prominent role as an example of faith in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. - A patron saint, patroness saint, patron hallow or heavenly protector is a saint who in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy is regarded as the heavenly advocate of a nation, place, craft, activity, class, clan, family or person. Catholics believe that patron saints, having already transcended to the metaphysical, are able to intercede effectively for the needs of their special charges.

(Associated Press) Robert Durst, far right, photographed through fencing, is escorted into Orleans Parish Criminal District Court through a tunnel entrance, in New Orleans, Monday, March 16, 2015. Durst waived extradition... (Associated Press) Analysis linking a letter Durst wrote to his friend Susan Berman a year before her death with one he said \\"only the killer could have written\\" to point police to her body was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation into the 2000 killing, the official not authorized to speak publicly told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing. Durst, 71, was charged Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. He waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him late Monday with being a felon in possession of a gun because he had a revolver when he was arrested there Saturday. It was not clear how soon he would be returned to California. Attorney Dick DeGuerin said outside court that Durst didn't kill Berman, and is \\"ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial.\\" Presented with the two letters in the finale of \\"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\\" that aired Sunday on HBO, the eccentric heir blinked, burped oddly, pulled his ear and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer. Then he stepped away from the tense interview and went to the bathroom, still wearing the live microphone that recorded what he said next. \\"There it is. You're caught!\\" Durst whispered before the sound of running water is heard. \\"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\\" That moment didn't just make for a captivating ending to the documentary on the eccentric life of an heir to a New York real estate fortune, it could also provide additional evidence for prosecutors. The official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the bathroom recording was not presented to prosecutors before charges were filed because detectives were still trying to determine if the recording was tampered with in any way. But legal experts said the audio and other parts of the interview could become key evidence. \\"Any statement that the defendant makes that they want to use against him, they can use against him,\\" said Andrea Roth, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \\"Even if it's sketchy, and only in context appears to make him look guilty.\\" Kerry Lawrence, a defense attorney in Westchester County, New York, said Durst's lawyers will have to try to explain away his comments, perhaps dismissing them as a joke. \\"Prosecutors would argue it was a candid moment of self-reflection, and I assume will argue that he knew he was still being recorded, and this was either said in jest or he was being facetious or sarcastic or was being provocative,\\" Lawrence said. \\"I don't think it's quite the smoking gun.\\" Durst — still worth millions despite his estrangement from his family, whose New York real estate empire is worth about 4 billion — has maintained his innocence in three killings in as many states. When Durst approached the filmmakers and agreed to go on camera, against the advice of his lawyers, he had already weathered one murder case, winning an acquittal in a gory Galveston, Texas, dismemberment case by claiming he shot his neighbor in self-defense. He was still suspected in the killing of Berman, whose father was a Las Vegas mobster associated with Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, and the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, who was declared dead long after she vanished in New York in 1982. Berman, 55, was shot once in the back of the head at her home near Beverly Hills shortly before New York investigators planned to question her about Kathleen Durst's disappearance. The documentary showed filmmaker Andrew Jarecki confronting Durst with a copy of an anonymous letter that alerted Beverly Hills police to look for a \\"cadaver\\" at Berman's address. Durst offered that whoever sent it was \\"taking a big risk. You're sending a letter to police that only the killer could have written.\\" Then, in the final episode, Jarecki revealed another envelope, which Durst acknowledged mailing to Berman, that has similar writing in block letters and also misspelled the address as \\"Beverley.\\" \\"I wrote this one but I did not write the cadaver one,\\" Durst said. But when shown an enlargement of both copies, Durst couldn't distinguish them. New York defense lawyer Michael Devorkin said the surprising thing was that police never unearthed the letter to Berman that filmmakers got their hands on. \\"Even if Durst wasn't the prime suspect, you would think they would have been looking through all her papers to see if the person who killed her had ever written her a letter,\\" Devorkin said. \\"Finding the letter was pure good fortune.\\" With the bathroom recording immediately following the confrontation over the two handwriting samples, prosecutors have strong evidence, said Devorkin, who handles white-collar criminal cases. \\"How often do you have a Perry Mason moment to end your documentary?\\" he said. ___ Melley and Tami Abdollah reported from Los Angeles.

Tomales Bay hunting season protested The winter migration of waterfowl over Tomales Bay is in full swing, and so is the squabble over duck hunting on a state-owned reserve at the estuary's southern end near the town of Point Reyes Station. The Tomales Bay Ecological Reserve is 483 acres of salt marsh and tidal flats that attract flights of local and migratory ducks and geese to an area that has been hunted by West Marin shotgunners for more than a century. But the sport is being challenged by animal rights advocates and some residents who are fed up with being awakened at dawn as hunters blast away in a place they think should be reserved for bird watching, not bird shooting. \\"It's not the same place as it was when they hunted years ago,\\" said Pat Healy, who has lived for more than 40 years in Point Reyes Station, population about 900. \\"It's past its time as a hunting ground.\\" It's another case of one group's established tradition colliding with another group's push for change. And both sides are aggressively collecting signatures on petitions supporting their views. In the middle is the state Department of Fish and Game, which owns the reserve and allows waterfowl hunting from mid-October to late January - a privilege opponents want rescinded. Healy is among a dozen or so homeowners who in recent weeks have gathered outside of the downtown Post Office and collected hundreds of signatures from locals and visitors. Their petition asserts that hunting \\"negatively impacts wildlife in the area, creates an unacceptable noise disturbance for our bayside communities and puts recreational users of the bay at risk.\\" Hunters, however, say the complaints are unfounded and dismiss them as attempts to infringe on a way of life that lifelong residents such as Robert Arndt of Inverness trace to their ancestors. \\"I am the fourth generation hunting on Tomales Bay. ... My kids will be the fifth and, if I'm lucky, my grandkids will be the sixth,\\" said Arndt, 46, who runs a local construction company. Like others who grew up in the area, Arndt learned to hunt in the reserve as a youngster with his father and grandfather. He is among the hunters who regularly set out their blinds and decoys and say they are \\"trying to preserve something for the next generation\\" in a county where public hunting areas are limited to two other sites - on San Pablo Bay and the Petaluma Marsh. \\"It's not just about me,\\" he said. \\"If we take this away, then the young people who are coming up in our society will not get a chance to experience what I experience.\\" Retired Marin County deputy sheriff Skip Richardson agreed. \\"It's part of our ancestry,\\" said Richardson, who remembered hunting lessons from his dad and granddad during overcast days spent in the bay, and the many subsequent outings he spent there with his children. \\"But I resent the fact that people with no standing come in here and try to take a way a God-given right every resident has had for several hundred years,\\" he added. Homeowners who live near the bay, such as Sylvia Timbers, see it differently and complain they are awakened on weekends by the sound of shotguns targeting waterfowl in the wetlands. \\"It's not just hearing the gunshots,\\" said Timbers, an author whose hillside home in Inverness overlooks a part of the reserve a quarter mile away. She said she is offended that hunters use blinds, decoys and duck calls to lure birds away from a nearby sanctuary, where hunting is outlawed. \\"We invite these birds to a party and hunters shoot them when they get there - it's just awful.\\" That sanctuary is the 560-acre Giacomini Wetlands, once a sprawling dairy pasture created from reclaimed marsh and tidal land by a prominent ranching family. It was purchased in 2008 by the National Park Service as a restoration site to help return Tomales Bay to its natural state. Hunting is outlawed there, but the property abuts the Fish and Game reserve, where hunting is allowed. Hunting near what conservationists agree is a haven for wildlife is seen by Susan Prince and other animal rights activists as an \\"ecological trap.\\" \\"Ethically, (hunting is) just the wrong thing to do,\\" said Prince, who has lived for 15 years in Point Reyes Station. \\"It's for the enjoyment of a few people and has an adverse affect on many more.\\" Timbers, who has lived in the area for more than 15 years, started an online advocacy group last year after she was awakened by \\"40 to 50\\" gunshots. The group, called Action Tomales Bay, is meant to draw attention to what Timbers said is an increasing level of hunting that has distressed a growing number of homeowners each season. Meanwhile, nearly 600 hunters and other supporters from across the region have signed an online petition on www.change.org, a Web site that Scott McMorrow of Inverness set up to keep the reserve open to hunting. McMorrow, who seldom hunts, said he believes hunters should have a platform to help protect their sport. Both sides plan to present petitions in May to the California Fish and Game Commission, which adopts and oversees policies of the Department of Fish and Game. John Krause, a wildlife biologist for Fish and Game, said the reserve is patrolled by game wardens who enforce hunting regulations that include a daily bag of seven ducks and eight geese per hunter. Hunting is permitted in the reserve between sunrise and sunset. \\"If hunters are within the reserve and they're not trespassing,\\" Krause said, \\"they're totally legal.\\" The disparate views that for years have shaped hunting into a contentious issue in West Marin are acknowledged by Craig Allen, who traveled one recent weekend to the reserve from his Santa Rosa home in Sonoma County, where he said public hunting spots are too crowded. \\"We understand what's going on out here,\\" Allen said as he emerged from the fog-shrouded reserve just after dawn with his hunting partner, ducks slung over their shoulders. \\"We're not trying to offend anyone. We're sympathetic to part of their reasoning - we understand they're sleeping.\\" But what some see as unjustifiable killing, he said, \\"I look at it as harvesting.\\" \\"The only thing I target is something that's going to go into my freezer and be consumed by my family.\\" Jacob Flannick is a freelance writer.

Please answer the following question: ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

She asks Willy Jack to stop at the local Walmart so that she can go to the bathroom and buy new shoes. When Novalee reaches out for her change at the checkout, the sum of 5.55 sends her into a panic as we learned early on that she believes that the number 5 is a bad omen. She runs barefoot outside to discover that Willy Jack has abandoned her and left only her new camera behind. Having no where else to go, she walks back inside and meets Thelma \\"Sister\\" Husband (Stockard Channing), a woman who runs the Welcome Wagon in town and gives her a Buck Eye Tree. Novalee also meets a photographer named Moses Whitecotton (Keith David) who advises her to give her baby a strong name. Later that evening, Novalee feels sick and runs into the bathroom again to vomit. When she comes out again, she discovers that the store is closed. She soon figures out how to live undetected in the Walmart. Meanwhile, Willy Jack is arrested and accused of fraternizing with an attractive stranger he had no idea is actually 14 years old.

This endemic canid became extinct in 1876, the first known canid to have become extinct in historical times. It was the only modern species in the genus \\"Dusicyon\\". - The American mink (\\"Neovison vison\\") is a semiaquatic species of mustelid native to North America, though human intervention has expanded its range to many parts of Europe and South America. Because of range expansion, the American mink is classed as a least-concern species by the IUCN. Since the extinction of the sea mink, the American mink is the only extant member of the genus \\"Neovison\\". The American mink is a carnivore which feeds on rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and birds. In its introduced range in Europe it has been classified as an invasive species linked to declines in European mink, Pyrenean desman, and water vole populations. It is the most frequently farmed animal for its fur, exceeding the silver fox, sable, marten, and skunk in economic importance. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health. - The martens constitute the genus Martes within the subfamily Mustelinae, in the family Mustelidae. Martens are slender, agile animals, adapted to living in taigas, and are found in coniferous and northern deciduous forests across the Northern Hemisphere. They have bushy tails, and large paws with partially retractible claws. The fur varies from yellowish to dark brown, depending on the species, and, in many cases, is valued by fur trappers. - Skunks are mammals known for their ability to spray a liquid with a strong odor. Different species of skunk vary in appearance from black-and-white to brown or cream colored, but all have warning coloration. - The sea mink (\\"Neovison macrodon\\") is an extinct North American member of the family Mustelidae. It is the only mustelid, and one of only two terrestrial mammal species in the order Carnivora known to have become extinct in historic times (the other being the Falkland Islands wolf). The body of the sea mink was significantly longer than that of the closely related American mink (\\"N. vison\\"), and also bulkier, leading to a pelt that was almost twice the size of the other species. The longest specimen recorded was said to be . The sea mink produced a distinctive odor, and had fur that was said to be coarser and redder than the American mink's. - The Mustelidae (from Latin \\"mustela\\", weasel) are a family of carnivorous mammals, including the weasel, badger, otter, marten, ferret, mink, stoat, and wolverine. Mustelids are diverse and the largest family in the order Carnivora. The internal classification is still disputed, with rival proposals containing between two and eight subfamilies. One study, published in 2008, questions the long-accepted Mustelinae subfamily, and suggests that the Mustelidae consist of four major clades and three much smaller lineages. - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - The sable (\\"Martes zibellina\\") is a marten species, a small carnivorous mammal inhabiting forest environments, primarily in Russia from the Ural Mountains throughout Siberia, eastern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, China, North and South Korea and Hokkaid in Japan. Its range in the wild originally extended through European Russia to Poland and Scandinavia. It has historically been hunted for its highly valued dark brown or black fur, which remains a luxury good to this day. While hunting of wild animals is still common in Russia, most fur in the market is now commercially farmed. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - The Pyrenean desman (\\"Galemys pyrenaicus\\") is a small semiaquatic nocturnal mammal related to moles and shrews, and is one of only two surviving species of the tribe Desmanini. The range of the species centers on northwestern Spain and northern Portugal, but it is under threat due to changes to its habitat. In Portugal it's called \\"\\"toupeira-d'água\\"\\" which means \\"water mole\\". - A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats. - Neovison is a genus of mustelids , including the extinct sea mink and the extant American mink . - Carnivora (from Latin \\"car\\" (stem \\"carn-\\") \\"flesh\\" and \\"vorre\\" \\"to devour\\") is a diverse order that includes over 280 species of placental mammals. Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans, whereas the word \\"carnivore\\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the least weasel (\\"Mustela nivalis\\"), at as little as and , to the polar bear (\\"Ursus maritimus\\"), which can weigh up to , to the southern elephant seal (\\"Mirounga leonina\\"), whose adult males weigh up to and measure up to in length.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Q: Chemical equations need to be balanced to satisfy the law of what? Choices: - material of matter - glow of matter - speed of matter - conservation of matter A: A:","completion":"The correct answer is - conservation of matter. Chemical equations need to be balanced to satisfy the law of conservation of matter, also known as the conservation of mass. This fundamental principle of chemistry was articulated by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century. It states that the mass of an isolated system will remain constant, irrespective of the processes acting inside the system. In the domain of chemical reactions specifically, the law asserts that the amount of matter remains constant throughout. The role of this law becomes quite clear when we're looking at reactions at the molecular level. A chemical reaction involves the reorganization of atoms – those that made up the reactants now form the products. However, a crucial point to note is that a chemical reaction does not destroy atoms or create new ones – it merely shuffles them around. Now, when a chemical equation isn't balanced, it suggests that atoms have been lost or made in the process, implying a violation of the law of conservation of matter, meaning that mass is not conserved in that reaction. This is physically impossible; this is why equations must be balanced. Balancing a chemical equation means ensuring that the number and types of atoms on the reactant side of the equation (before the reaction) are identical to the number and types of atoms on the product side of the equation (after the reaction). It is a way to numerically demonstrate the law of conservation of matter. Balancing an equation does not change the essence of the reaction it's representing, but makes the equation adhere to physical laws and realities. Therefore, to respect the law of conservation of matter, whenever you write a chemical equation and balance it, you need to ensure that the quantity and type of atoms in the reactants is equal to the quantity and type of atoms in the products. This allows the equations to portray accurately the reorganization happening in the molecular world during chemical reactions. Thus, the law of conservation of matter is the fundamental reason chemical equations need to be balanced. So, it's not a matter of the material of matter, glow of matter, or speed of matter; the requirement to balance a chemical equation is firmly rooted in the concept of the conservation of matter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -3 - 9 = 12*z for z.","completion":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step like we're talking to a 5-year-old. We have this problem: -3 - 9 = 12 * z First, let's solve the left side of the equation: -3 - 9 Imagine you have 3 apples and someone takes away 9 more apples. You don't have enough apples, right? So now you owe 12 apples to that person. That's why the result is -12. So, the equation now is: -12 = 12 * z Now, we need to find the value of 'z.' We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 12. -12 ÷ 12 = (12 * z) ÷ 12 When we do this, we see that 12 ÷ 12 is 1. So, we can remove the 12 from the right side of the equation: -12 ÷ 12 = z And -12 ÷ 12 is -1. So the final answer is: z = -1 So, the solution to the math problem is z equals -1."},{"prompt":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: The Thomas Crown Affair Movie plot: At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, an attempted robbery of precious paintings fails when museum employees discover imposters posing as staff. In all the confusion of locking down the museum and capturing the robbers, Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) slips into an adjacent room and steals the painting of San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk by Monet. The insurers of the 100 million artwork send investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) to assist NYPD Detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) in solving the crime. In reviewing video of the rooms involved in both robberies, one of which was strangely \\"blank\\", Banning follows clues to discover how both robberies are connected. She quickly comes to suspect that the wealthy financier Thomas Crown is behind the theft. Banning is intrigued at his motivations and begins a game of cat-and-mouse to recover the painting. Despite the fact that both of them intuitively know what the other is up to, the two of them continue to meet in high class locations and intimate surroundings while Banning continues to search for the painting. The constant contact, matching of wits (and the romantic pursuit of Crown), cause Banning to fall in love with him. But her commitment to her job and her doubts about Crown's true intentions make her hesitate. To prove his love to her, Crown promises to return the stolen artwork to the museum. In her doubt, Banning betrays Crown's plan to Detective McCann who fills the museum with dozens of police officers in an attempt to catch him in the act. After a grand game of misdirection, the painting is returned and another one is stolen; one which Banning had previously expressed a desire to possess. Since the second stolen painting is insured by another company and her job is now finished, Banning's knowledge of Crown's plan allows her to meet him at a prearranged spot. But the person she meets instead convinces her that her betrayal has cost her more than she can bear. Crown's witty nature ultimately allows for both him and Banning to run away and live happily...

There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes.

Article: Two American scientists told the people in industrial nations that they would be much healthier if they ate more of the same kind of foods eaten by humans living more than 10,000 years ago. The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on the earth,but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in lifestyles and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \\"diseases of civilization \\".Many cancers and diseases of the blood system,including heart attacks and strokes are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted that early stoneage people used very little alcohol or tobacco ,probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise,but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stoneage people hunted wild animals for their meat ,which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products ,and they made very little use of grains . But today,we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stoneage people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C. People today probably do not want to live as people thousands of years ago did,but scientists say that we would be much healthier if we ate as those ancient people did,cutting the amount of fatty,salty and sweet foods. Question: New kinds of sicknesses have been found because _ . Options: A: the human body has changed compared with human first appeared on earth B: the way we live has changed a little C: our body can't deal with the changes in lifestyles D: the way we live today are proper for the human body","completion":"C: our body can't deal with the changes in lifestyles"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

W, Kinglake, who portrayed the British as victims of newspaper sensationalism and duplicitous French and Ottoman diplomacy.\\" answer the question \\"What did A.W Kinglake make the British out to be?\\" Choose from: (1). yes. (2). no.","completion":"Yes, the sentence provided does answer the question \\"What did A.W Kinglake make the British out to be?\\" According to the sentence, A.W Kinglake popularized the view of 'diplomatic drift' as the cause of the war, where he portrayed the British as victims of newspaper sensationalism and duplicitous French and Ottoman diplomacy. This means that Kinglake made the British out to be unfortunate and innocent participants in the war, who were led astray by misleading information and the deceptive actions of their diplomatic partners in France and the Ottoman Empire. Kinglake's perspective, as presented in this sentence, presents the British as more or less passive actors in the conflict, with external factors - particularly the sensationalist media and duplicity of other nations - pushing them towards war. This view absolves the British of primary responsibility for the war, as Kinglake suggests that they were acting in response to misinformation and the deceitful maneuvers of other countries involved. In this way, Kinglake's portrayal of the British paints them as victims rather than as aggressive or colonialist actors, seeking to expand their power and influence through military conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If I pick a random point on number line, what is the probability that picked point correspond to a rational number? If you picked a number at random on the number line, would it have a greater chance of being rational or irrational?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are essentially asking about the same concept – the likelihood of picking a rational or irrational number when choosing a point at random on the number line. However, the first question inquires about the specific probability of picking a rational number, while the second question asks for a comparison between the chances of selecting a rational and an irrational number. It would be helpful to provide a comprehensive answer that addresses both formulations of the question. To begin with, let's define rational and irrational numbers. A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction, p/q, where p and q are integers and q is not equal to zero. Examples of rational numbers include 3 (which can be written as 3/1), -3/4, and 1/2. Irrational numbers, on the other hand, cannot be expressed as a fraction. They are typically non-repeating, non-terminating decimals, like pi or the square root of 2. Addressing the first question, it is easy to think that the probability of choosing a rational number is relatively high, given that there are infinitely many rational numbers on the number line – any two integers will form a rational number when one is divided by the other. However, it turns out that the set of irrational numbers between any two rational numbers is also infinite. This complicates the issue of determining the probability of picking a rational number. To illustrate this point, let's consider an example. If we pick two rational numbers on the number line, such as 1/2 and 3/4, we can always find an irrational number sandwiched between them (e.g., the square root of 2/2). This situation is the same for any two rational numbers regardless of how close they are to each other. As a result, there are infinitely many irrational numbers as well as rational numbers on the number line. Intuitively, it seems that there should be a way to compare these two infinite sets to determine whether one is \\"larger\\" or \\"denser\\" than the other, thus affecting the probability of choosing a rational or irrational number. However, mathematicians Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind have proven that the set of rational numbers is countable, meaning that it is possible to list all rational numbers in a way where each can be assigned a unique positive integer, whereas the set of irrational numbers is uncountable, which means they cannot be matched to a unique set of positive integers using any method; uncountable infinity is considered \\"larger\\" than countable infinity. Based on these findings, it can be inferred that the probability of picking a rational number on the number line is essentially 0. Although there are infinitely many rational numbers, the existence of uncountably infinite irrational numbers between any two rationals renders the chances of randomly selecting a rational number to be practically nonexistent. Addressing the second question, considering the nature of both rational and irrational numbers, and the fact that the set of irrational numbers is larger, denser, and uncountable versus the countable set of rational numbers, it can be concluded that the probability of choosing a number at random on the number line leans heavily towards it being an irrational number rather than a rational one. In conclusion, both questions revolve around the likelihood of choosing a rational or irrational number on the number line, but the first one specifically asks for the probability of picking a rational number, while the second focuses on comparing the probability of choosing a rational vs. an irrational number. Since irrational numbers constitute an uncountable infinity, and rational numbers are countable, the possibility of picking an irrational number at random on the number line is much greater than the chance of picking a rational number, and the probability of selecting a rational number is essentially 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

David Paradine Frost was born in Tenterden, Kent, on 7 April 1939, the son of a Methodist minister of Huguenot descent, the Rev. Wilfred John \\"W. J.\\" Paradine Frost, and his wife, Mona (Aldrich); he had two elder sisters. While living in Gillingham, Kent, he was taught in the Bible class of the Sunday school at his father's church (Byron Road Methodist) by David Gilmore Harvey, and subsequently started training as a Methodist local preacher, which he did not complete. Frost attended Barnsole Road Primary School in Gillingham, St Hugh's School, Woodhall Spa, Gillingham Grammar School and finally - while residing in Raunds - Wellingborough Grammar School. Throughout his school years he was an avid football and cricket player, and was offered a contract with Nottingham Forest F.C. Frost was one of the \\"Famous Five\\" who launched TV-am in February 1983 but, like LWT in the late 1960s, the station began with an unsustainable \\"highbrow\\" approach. Frost remained a presenter after restructuring. Frost on Sunday began in September 1983 and continued until the station lost its franchise at the end of 1992. Frost had been part of an unsuccessful consortium, CPV-TV, with Richard Branson and other interests, which had attempted to acquire three ITV contractor franchises prior to the changes made by the Independent Television Commission in 1991. After transferring from ITV, his Sunday morning interview programme Breakfast with Frost ran on the BBC from January 1993 until 29 May 2005. For a time it ran on BSB before moving to BBC 1. Frost hosted Through the Keyhole, which ran on several UK channels from 1987 until 2008 and also featured Loyd Grossman. Produced by his own production company, the programme was first shown in prime time and on daytime television in its later years. Frost worked for Al Jazeera English, presenting a live weekly hour-long current affairs programme, Frost Over The World, which started when the network launched in November 2006. The programme regularly made headlines with interviewees such as Tony Blair, President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. The programme was produced by the former Question Time editor and Independent on Sunday journalist Charlie Courtauld. Frost was one of the first to interview the man who authored the Fatwa on Terrorism, Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. During his career as a broadcaster Frost became one of Concorde's most frequent fliers, having flown between London and New York an average of 20 times per year for 20 years. In 2007, Frost hosted a discussion with Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Monitor Group's involvement in the country.

Step 2: Identify Symptoms Here are some common symptoms of HELLP Syndrome: - Fatigue or general malaise - Headaches - Nausea and vomiting - Abdominal pain, particularly in the upper right quadrant - Swelling, especially in the hands and face - Rapid weight gain - Vision changes, such as seeing spots or blurriness - High blood pressure Step 3: Consult a Healthcare Professional If you suspect that you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of HELLP Syndrome, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional, such as an obstetrician or a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, as soon as possible. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to reduce the risks and complications associated with this condition. Step 4: Treatment and Management HELLP Syndrome is typically treated by addressing the underlying conditions. Some possible treatments might include: - Blood pressure medications to control high blood pressure - Corticosteroid injections to help mature the baby's lungs, in case an early delivery is necessary - Magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures - Blood transfusions if platelet levels are dangerously low Often, the definitive treatment for HELLP Syndrome is the delivery of the baby, even if the pregnancy is not yet at term. Your healthcare provider will closely monitor the severity of the condition and determine the optimal timing for delivery. Step 5: Post-Treatment Monitoring After HELLP Syndrome has been treated, it is important to continue monitoring both the mother and the baby. Regular check-ups and follow-ups with healthcare providers will help ensure a safe recovery for the mother and appropriate growth and development for the baby. In conclusion, recognizing and treating HELLP Syndrome in pregnancy involves being aware of the symptoms, consulting with a healthcare professional, receiving appropriate treatment and management, and undergoing post-treatment monitoring and follow-up care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly.

In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life. He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits. Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, \\"one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art\\".Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls. Sales of the Gallery lagged due to the Panic of 1837; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states, peddling his books from town to town, with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home. Later in 1837, he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners, Toppan, Draper, Longacre & Co. With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks, the firm prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York.

When Daniel's father remarried after a divorce, Daniel, who was eleven, and his little sister, Kristie, came to live with us. My husband and I were more than happy to have kids in the house again. Things were going along just fine until the diabetes I've lived with most of my adult life started affecting my eyes, and then more seriously, my kidneys . Then everything seemed to fall apart. Three times a week, I had to go to the hospital to be hooked up to a dialysis machine . I was living, but I couldn't really call it a life -- it was an existence. I had no energy. I dragged myself through daily chores and slept as much as I could. My sense of humor seemed to disappear. Daniel, seventeen by then, was really affected by the change in me. He tried as hard as he could to make me laugh, to bring back the grandma who loved to clown around with him. Even in my sorry state, Daniel could still bring a smile to my face. But things were not improving. After a year on dialysis, my condition was deteriorating and the doctors felt that if I didn't receive a kidney transplant within six months, I would surely die. No one told Daniel this, but he knew -- he said all he had to do was look after me. To top it off, as my condition worsened, there was a chance that I would become too weak to have the transplant surgery at all, and then there would be nothing they could do for me. So we started the tense and desperate wait for a kidney. I was adamant that I didn't want a kidney from anyone I knew. I would wait until an appropriate kidney became available, or I would literally die waiting. But Daniel had other plans. The time that he took me to my dialysis appointments, he did a little secret research on his own. Then he announced his intention to me. \\"Grandma, I'm giving you one of my kidneys.

Question: What is Flik's latest invention? Movie title: A Bug's Life Movie plot: Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, lives in a colony of ants in the middle of a dried creek. They are led by Princess Atta and her mother, the Queen. The colony is oppressed by a gang of marauding grasshoppers, led by Hopper, that arrive every season demanding food from the ants. One day, when the annual offering is accidentally knocked into a stream by Flik's latest invention, a grain-harvesting device, the grasshoppers demand twice as much food as compensation. The ants trick Flik into accepting his plan to recruit \\"warrior bugs\\" to fight off the grasshoppers. While Flik actually believes in the plan, the other ants see it as an opportunity to get rid of Flik and save themselves trouble. Making his way to the \\"big city\\" (a heap of trash under a trailer), Flik mistakes a group of circus bugs that have recently been dismissed by their money-hungry ringmaster, P.T. Flea, for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island. After they arrive, the circus bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings during a welcome performance by the ants. The circus bugs then attempt to leave, but are forced back by a bird that attacks the group. They save Dot, Atta's younger sister, from the bird as they flee, gaining the ants' respect in the process. At Flik's insistence, they continue the ruse of being \\"warriors\\" so the troupe can continue to enjoy the attention and hospitality of the ants. The bird encounter inspires Flik into creating a false bird to scare away the grasshoppers. While the bird is being built, Hopper reveals to the other grasshoppers how greatly the ants outnumber them and worries that they will eventually turn on them.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Rauner's questionable term-limits drive is underway There's no question in my mind that the Committee for Legislative Reform and Term Limits, an independent arm of Republican Bruce Rauner's campaign for Illinois governor, will get the nearly 300,000 petition signatures needed to put the term-limits question on the November 2014 ballot. Rauner has very deep pockets and, as I noted recently, the idea is wildly popular with voters. It never loses when put to a referendum vote, and polls consistently show it with a 70 percent-plus approval rating. So there's also no question in my mind that the proposition will pass if it's put before the voters. But I very much question whether the Illinois Supreme Court will allow the question to be placed on the ballot, no matter how many signatures Team Rauner gathers or how dramatically opinion polling favors it. The justices blocked a similar attempt in 1994 when then-Treasurer Pat Quinn was leading the effort. Their reasoning went as follows: The power of citizens to initiate amendments to the state constitution via petition drive was limited by the framers only \\"to structural and procedural subjects contained\\" in Article IV, the one that deals with the legislature. The reason for this limit, for better or worse, was to prevent Illinois from becoming a state in which legislative questions — about taxes, marijuana, gay mar riage, abortion and so on — were routinely left up to the voters. So would term limits change the structure of the legislature? No, the majority ruled in 1994. Even with term limits, \\"The General Assembly would remain a bicameral legislature consisting of a House and Senate with a total of 177 members, and would maintain the same organization.\\" Would it change the procedures of the legislature? Again, no. \\"The process by which the General Assembly adopts a law would remain unchanged\\" with the addition of term limits, said the majority opinion. And even if the answer was \\"yes\\" to one of those questions, the constitution requires that it be \\"yes\\" to both. \\"This court is without authority to substitute 'or' for the 'and' the constitutional convention used in stating 'structural and procedural,'\\" noted the opinion. So why do supporters of Rauner's political action committee expect a different result this time? First, because the 1994 decision was narrowly decided — 4-3 — and there are now six new justices on the court (though the one remaining justice, Charles Freeman, was part of the majority). The dissent in 1994 argued that \\"Democracy should be permitted to take its course\\" and that the nitpicky linguistic parsing of the majority resulted in \\"a fiction that venerates the power of our incumbent legislators and demeans the intelligence of their constituents.\\" And second, because the Committee for Legislative Reform and Term Limits has larded onto its petition two other proposals. One of them changes the structure of the legislature by increasing the size of the House and shrinking the Senate. The other changes the procedures of the legislature by raising the requirement to override a governor's veto to a two-thirds vote of the legislature from the current three-fifths. If, earlier this week when Rauner's proposal was formally unveiled, you wondered why it included this pair of off-the-radar-screen ideas, now you know: It's an effort to create a plausible reason for the Supreme Court to give the OK. \\"These are three interrelated reforms,\\" said Mike Schrimpf, a spokesman for Rauner and the term-limits effort. \\"Taken all together, they make the legislature more responsive to the citizens and they make elections more competitive.\\" He pointed to an earlier state Supreme Court ruling that allowed on the ballot the multipart referendum that shrank the legislature, created single-member districts and eliminated cumulative voting. But it's a stretch. Clearly, term limits is a separate and separable issue from veto thresholds and the size of the legislative chambers. And, equally clearly, it's the sort of question that doesn't pass the constitutional test for citizen initiatives, no matter how many other gaudy, distracting questions you surround it with. But will the Supreme Court have the courage once again to buck public opinion and give term limits the heave-ho?","completion":"A man named Bruce Rauner wants to change some rules for the people who make laws in Illinois. He is trying to get enough people to agree so that everyone can vote on it. It is called term limits, which means people can only be in charge for a certain amount of time. Many people like this idea, but some think it might not be allowed. In the past, a similar idea was stopped because it didn't follow the rules for how to change things. This time, Rauner added more changes to his idea, hoping it will be allowed. We will have to wait and see if the important judges let people vote on it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The worst earthquake in 40 years shook South Asia on Sunday, starting with horrible waves that swept entire villages into the sea. At least 20,000 people in six countries were killed in the disaster, and millions were left homeless. The quake shook deep beneath the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It was felt more than 3000 miles away in East Africa, where heavy tides kept fishermen at home and resorts closed. It was as if the sea had struck the land. Residents of Sri Lanka, a small island country off the coast of India, ran to the hills to find safety from the tsunami. Many took their radios, televisions, and other valuables with them. The disaster hit Sri Lanka hardest. Of its 20million people, 1 million lost their homes, and 10000 died. \\"The water simply raised itself up and huge waves came ashore,\\" wrote eye-witness Peter Thomas from India. \\"It was moving very fast.

Summarize: After a nervous first-half display, the Republic raised the tempo after the break and Jeff Hendrick's fine run set up Walters's 69th-minute winner. The Republic stay third in Group D but they have a four-point cushion over Scotland after Germany won in Glasgow. Poland remain second after routing Gibraltar 8-1 in Warsaw. The Republic are still four points behind group leaders Germany but, with two matches remaining, they are now in position to clinch at least a play-off spot. However, those are two tough games as they first host Germany in Dublin on 8 October before concluding their campaign in Poland. That said, one win would guarantee Martin O'Neill's side one of the eight play-off places. And a win in Warsaw would clinch an automatic qualifying spot for the Irish if Scotland beat Poland in Glasgow three days earlier. The one downside from the Republic's win was the bookings picked up by Glenn Whelan and James McClean, which will rule them out of the Germany contest. Hendrick's stunning run and cross as he jinked past three attempted challenges before setting up Walters to stab home dramatically changed the contest at the Aviva Stadium. Media playback is not supported on this device The Republic had looked jittery in the first period as Georgia striker Levan Mchedlidze twice went close after being set up by impressive playmaker Tornike Okriashvili. But boosted by the half-time introduction of Shane Long for the ineffective Robbie Keane, the Republic lifted the pace in the second half as the busy Glenn Whelan and Hendrick tested keeper Nukri Revishvili. Yet, the Georgians still looked largely comfortable until Hendrick's bit of magic set up Walters's winner. For that delightful piece of skill alone, the Derby midfielder has to be the man of the match. Despite lifting the pace after half-time, the Republic were still showing little sign of breaking down the Georgia defence until Hendrick's moment of inspiration. Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill: \\"That was very tense. We didn't play well in the first half. We were very tentative. You might even say nervous. \\"But in the second half there was a great turnaround, with great effort and application and we found a way to win. Jeff Hendrick was absolutely magnificent for the goal. He has the ability to do that. He just needs a wee bit more encouragement. \\"And it was great to see Jon Walters, who has had a fantastic tournament for us, get the goal. He's got a great, great heart.\\" Republic of Ireland goalscorer Jon Walters: \\"It was all about the result tonight. It was tough but we knew it was going to be that. \\"We managed a 1-0 (win) and we couldn't have asked for any more. Fair play to Jeff Hendrick. He made the goal for me. He's got that ability.

If you can't purchase it directly from the roaster within a week or so of it being roasted, opt for a vacuum-sealed bag from a reputable national coffee-bean roaster. Purchase your own coffee grinder, or grind it in the store.","completion":"Step 1: Grind the coffee beans Grind the freshly roasted whole bean coffee using your coffee grinder. The grind size should be medium-fine for drip coffee makers or coarse for a French press. This step is crucial as freshly ground coffee provides a better flavor and aroma compared to pre-ground coffee. Step 2: Measure the coffee and water For a standard cup of black coffee (8 ounces), measure 0.35 ounces (about 2 tablespoons) of ground coffee. Measure 8 ounces of fresh, cold water for each cup of coffee you want to brew. Step 3: Boil the water Bring the measured water to a boil using a kettle or saucepan. If using an electric kettle with temperature settings, set it to around 200°F (93°C). If you don't have a temperature-controlled kettle, let the water sit off the heat for about 30 seconds after it reaches boiling. Step 4: Prepare your brewing equipment If using a drip coffee maker, place a coffee filter in the filter basket. Pour the ground coffee into the filter and make sure it's evenly distributed. If using a French press, place the ground coffee directly into the press. Step 5: Brew the coffee In a drip coffee maker, pour the hot water into the water reservoir and start the machine. The water will pass through the coffee grounds and into the carafe, making black coffee. For a French press, pour the hot water over the coffee grounds, ensuring they are all saturated. Place the lid on the press and let it steep for four minutes. After steeping, slowly press down the plunger, allowing the coffee to pass through the filter and retaining the grounds in the bottom. Pour the black coffee into a cup. Step 6: Serve and enjoy Pour the freshly brewed black coffee into your cup and enjoy it! If desired, you can add sugar, milk, or any other preferred additions, but black coffee is traditionally served plain.

Choices: - effective - unusual - positive - negative A: The answer is:","completion":"Negative. Electrons are subatomic particles that orbit the nucleus of an atom. They are a fundamental component of matter, and their behavior plays a crucial role in understanding the nature of chemical reactions and interactions between atoms. Electrons possess a specific kind of charge, which influences their behavior when interacting with other charged particles – such as other electrons, or the protons found in the nucleus of an atom. The charge of an electron is negative. To provide more context and insight into this property, it is necessary to understand the broader concept of electric charge. Charge is a fundamental property of certain subatomic particles (like electrons and protons) that dictates how they interact with one another through electromagnetic force. There are two types of electric charge: positive and negative. In an atom, protons carry a positive charge, while electrons carry a negative charge. It is a convention that the charge of a proton is considered to be +1, while the charge of an electron is considered to be -1. These charges cause interactions between particles – opposite charges attract (a negatively charged electron will be attracted to a positively charged proton), while like charges repel (two negatively charged electrons will repel each other). The other choices provided, \\"effective\\" and \\"unusual,\\" are not pertinent to the type of charge that electrons possess. The term \\"effective\\" usually refers to something having a practical result or being productive, while the term \\"unusual\\" suggests that something is not common or typical. These terms can be applied to various contexts, but they do not accurately describe the type of charge carried by electrons. In summary, electrons carry a negative charge. Understanding this property is essential in the study of atomic structure, chemical bonding, and various other aspects of chemistry and physics. The charged nature of electrons plays a central role in how atoms interact and form molecules, as well as essential phenomena such as electricity and magnetism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

London used fossil fuels, while Edmonton use entirely hydro power to generate energy. Which city causes less acid rain? A:","completion":"The city producing less acid rain would be Edmonton. Step 1: Identify the causes of acid rain: Acid rain is caused by sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) released into the atmosphere. Most of these pollutants are produced from combustion of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. Step 2: Compare the source of energy for both cities: London uses fossil fuels, which during combustion, releases gases like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. These gases react in the atmosphere with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form various acidic compounds, causing acid rain. Edmonton, on the other hand, uses hydro power which is a clean, non-polluting source of energy. Hydroelectric generation does not emit any of the gases that cause acid rain. Step 3: Draw Conclusion: Since Edmonton uses hydropower for electricity generation, which does not produce SO2 or NOx (the contributors to acid rain), it can be concluded that Edmonton causes less acid rain than London."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Here is a news article: ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek officials say human bones found in a resplendent ancient tomb excavated last year in northern Greece belong to at least five individuals, including an elderly woman and a baby. The high-profile excavation at ancient Amphipolis uncovered a large, vaulted tomb decorated with marble statues of sphinxes and young women, as well as a remarkable mosaic pavement. A Culture Ministry statement Monday said bones found in the grave belong to a woman over 60, a newborn, two men aged 35-45 and another adult. The tomb has been dated to between 325 B.C. — two years before the death of ancient Greek warrior-king Alexander the Great — and 300 B.C. Experts speculated it could have been built for a general or a relative of Alexander's, who himself was buried in Egypt. ||||| ATHENS A vast ancient tomb once thought to possibly house the remains of Alexander the Great contains bones of a woman, a newborn baby and two men and fragments of a cremated person, the Greek culture ministry said on Monday. Speculation that the limestone grave in the Amphipolis tomb site might belong to the legendary Alexander, to one of his generals or to family members reached fever pitch in recent months as archeologist kept unearthing tantalizing finds. The Amphipolis site, believed to be the largest ancient tomb to have been discovered in Greece, dates back to Alexander's era, around 300-325 B.C. The ancient conqueror died in Babylonia - in present day Iraq - in 323 B.C. after a military campaign across the Middle East out to present-day Pakistan. His burial site is not known but historians place it in the Egyptian city of Alexandria. The culture ministry said research on the tomb's bones showed the buried woman was over 60 years old and about 1.57 meters tall while the two men were aged 35 to 45 years old. One of the men had cut marks in his left chest that were most likely from mortal injuries inflicted by a knife or small sword, the ministry said. The men had an estimated height of 1.62 to 1.68 meters. The few burned bone remains of the fifth interred person, who was cremated, could not reveal the person's gender and authorities said further testing would be carried out. Further analysis will also be done on the bones of the woman and two men to determine if they were related. \\"Part of the analysis will look into a possible blood relationship ... but the lack of teeth and cranial parts that are used in ancient DNA analysis may not allow for a successful identification,\\" the ministry said. Excavations at the site near Greece's second city of Thessaloniki began in 2012 and captured global attention last August when archaeologists announced the discovery of a vast tomb guarded by two sphinxes and circled by a 497-metre marble wall. Since then the tomb has also yielded a colorful floor mosaic depicting the abduction of Persephone, the daughter of Zeus, the supreme deity of ancient Greece, as well as two sculpted female figures known as Caryatids. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Editing by Tom Heneghan) ||||| Athens (AFP) - Bones from at least five people, including a baby and an elderly woman, were identified in a massive tomb in Greece dating back to the era of Alexander the Great, the culture ministry said Monday. \\"A minimum number of five people have been identified from bone remains, four of whom were buried and one of whom was burned,\\" the ministry said in a statement. \\"The dead are a woman, two middle-aged men and a newborn\\" and a fifth person whose sex could not be verified, it said. The woman was estimated to be aged over 60, and the two men between 35 and 45 years old, officials said. No other details were immediately available on the baby and the fifth person. The excavation of the tomb in Amphipolis, northern Greece -- the largest ever unearthed in the country -- made global headlines this summer amid speculation that a member of Alexander the Great's entourage had been buried there. The ministry had originally thought that a single skeleton lay in the tomb, but on Monday said that out of 550 bone fragments found, 157 had been matched to specific bodies so far. View gallery Picture provided by the Greek Ministry of Culture on November 12, 2014 shows a grave found in the to … Other bones were those of animals, including a horse. The tomb, measuring 500 metres (1,640 feet) in circumference and dug into a 30-metre hill -- was found to contain sculptures of sphinxes and caryatids, intricate mosaics and coins featuring the face of Alexander the Great. Before the announcements, it was thought that the tomb could contain Alexander's Bactrian wife Roxana, the king's mother Olympias, or one of his generals. The tomb's location was known in antiquity, and it is believed to have been repeatedly looted following the conquest of the ancient Macedonian kingdom by Rome in the second century BC. Few relics were found, and the culture ministry confirmed on Monday that even the grave inside the tomb had been searched. \\"The condition in which the bones were found indicates that they had been disturbed,\\" it said. In December, the ministry dismissed as \\"unfounded\\" claims on Greek websites that the bones were those of a 54-year-old woman, and is therefore likely to be Olympias. Historians say it is also highly unlikely to have been Alexander himself, who conquered the Persian empire and much of the known world before his death at the age of 32 in 323 BC. Additional research will determine whether the dead were related, the ministry said. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The ancient tomb discovered in Amphipolis, Greece, dating back to the era of Alexander the Great, contains the remains of at least five individuals.

Answer choices: - duplicate itself - Regrows it - Relieve pain - protect them - food and shelter - motility - Helps it survive - heating liquids Answer:","completion":"Potassium is an essential mineral and electrolyte that plays a crucial role in maintaining the proper functioning of an animal's cells, tissues, and organs. While none of the provided answer choices precisely depicts the functions of potassium in an animal, the closest choice would be \\"Helps it survive.\\" However, to understand the importance of potassium in an animal's survival, we should explore its specific functions further. Here are some key roles that potassium plays in an animal's body: 1. Fluid balance: Potassium helps maintain the balance of fluids inside and outside the cells. This balance is critical for various physiological processes, including waste removal, nutrient transport, and osmotic pressure regulation. 2. Nerve function: Potassium plays a central role in nerve signal transmission by maintaining the resting membrane potential of nerve cells. This allows nerve cells to transmit electrical signals efficiently, facilitating communication between different parts of the body and helping to control essential functions like muscle movement and sensory perception. 3. Muscle function: Potassium is vital for proper muscle function, including contraction and relaxation. Adequate potassium levels are essential for maintaining muscle strength, flexibility, and overall health. 4. Heart function: As an electrolyte, potassium is crucial for maintaining the electrical activity of the heart. It helps regulate heart rhythm, ensuring that the heart beats at a steady and appropriate rate. 5. Acid-base balance: Potassium contributes to the maintenance of the acid-base balance in the body, helping to regulate the pH levels of body fluids, which is essential for numerous metabolic processes. 6. Regulates blood pressure: Potassium plays a role in regulating blood pressure by helping control the balance of fluids and minerals within blood vessels. A balanced potassium level can aid in the prevention of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. 7. Nutrient metabolism: Potassium is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins, aiding in the conversion of nutrients into energy. In summary, potassium plays a vital role in an animal's survival by contributing to numerous critical physiological processes such as fluid balance, nerve and muscle function, heart function, acid-base balance, blood pressure regulation, and nutrient metabolism. Although potassium does not primarily provide food, shelter, or other protective functions, its presence is essential for maintaining the overall health and survival of animals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What does the chief of Tahiti convince the HMS Bounty's captain to do? ? One night in Portsmouth, England in 1787, a press gang breaks into a local tavern and presses all of the men drinking there into naval service. One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is HMS Bounty. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is William Bligh and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The Bounty leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. Fletcher Christian, the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian. During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of Tahiti, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take to the West Indies, as intended, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti, and his daughter, Tehani, and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his one-day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti. Christian promises her he will be back someday.

How do astronauts entertain themselves while working in the space station? I will answer this question: Astronauts have a variety of ways to entertain themselves while working in the space station. They can watch movies or TV shows, listen to music or podcasts, play games, read books, or do various forms of exercise.

I will answer this question: As the International Space Station orbits Earth every 90 minutes, a Muslim astronaut would experience multiple sunrises and sunsets during a 24-hour period. This makes it challenging to follow traditional fasting times based on their home country's schedule. Muslim scholars have suggested different solutions for this. One approach is for Muslim astronauts to follow the time of the home country, or the country from which they launched. Another approach is to observe the schedule of a country that is closer to the Equator, where daylight hours remain relatively stable throughout the year.

Now, imagine the sensation a perfectly-crafted viral video wedding proposal could create for you and your significant other! In this day of social media, an epic proposal can not only leave a lasting impression on your partner but also capture the hearts of people around the world. How, you ask? Here are some valuable tips to help you nail your viral video wedding proposal. 1. Do Your Homework The first step in planning any wedding proposal is understanding your partner and what they truly value. Reflect upon their likes, dislikes, hobbies, and dreams. List down all the possible settings, themes, and storylines that resonate with your partner. You might also want to consult with their close friends and family for additional insights and ideas. 2. Think Outside the Box The more unique an idea is, the better the chances it has to go viral. Be imaginative and brainstorm innovative proposals that haven't been seen before. Explore creative themes, surprising locations, and original concepts that both represent your relationship and offer something new. 3. Personalize the Experience Your proposal should tell the story of your relationship. It shouldn't be a generic experience; make it personal and customized. Incorporate inside jokes, shared experiences, and meaningful moments that define your bond. Personalization sets the foundation for a truly unforgettable proposal. 4. Engage Professionals Considering that you're aiming to go viral with your wedding proposal, it's vital to involve experts who can help to bring your vision to life. Connect with a reputable event planning agency or a professional videographer with prior experience in proposals or viral content. Remember that the production quality of your video is just as important as the proposal concept itself. 5. Embrace the Element of Surprise Though your partner might be expecting a proposal at some point, surprising them with an unexpected or disguised proposal can make the moment even more special. Think of ways to throw them off the track or create an entirely new context to maintain the element of surprise. 6. Invite Friends and Family Involving close friends and family can add an emotional and memorable touch to your proposal. Besides, they can help you execute your surprise or even play a part in the proposal itself. However, be cautious not to overcrowd the moment or overshadow the intimacy between you and your significant other. 7. Practice, Practice, Practice Nerves and excitement can sometimes throw plans off course; hence, it's essential to practice your lines or actions multiple times to get it just right.

The streets are busy and the traffic is heavy, but the pollution is not very serious . In our town, more than half of the buildings have fifteen to thirty floors. Most of the people live in such tall buildings, but they don't have to climb the stairs. They use lifts to go up and down. Many restaurants, supermarkets, cinemas and theatres are in very tall buildings. They are big, bright and modern. So people enjoy eating, shopping, seeing films and watching plays in them. The streets in our town are wide, but because there are too many cars, they are still very busy. Sometimes when you come to the street crossing, you have to wait for the green lights for a long time. The people in our town never put _ everywhere or put dirty water into the river, so you cannot see much pollution in our town. I hope you'll come to visit our town if you like.

The left side of the equation has two terms containing w: -478*w and -146*w. The right side of the equation has one term containing w: 85*w. Combining the terms with w on the left side yields: (-478 - 146) * w = 85 * w + 11344 (-624) * w = 85 * w + 11344 Step 2: Move all terms with w to one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 85 * w from both sides of the equation: -624 * w - 85 * w = 11344 Combining the terms with w on the left side gives: -709 * w = 11344 Step 3: Solve the equation for w. To solve for w, we can divide both sides of the equation by -709: w = 11344 / (-709) Using a calculator, we find that: w ≈ -16 So, the solution to the equation -478 * w - 146 * w = 85 * w + 11344 is w ≈ -16."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: what did dada artists think of art in past museums I found the following answer on Google: Another theory says that the name \\"Dada\\" came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French-German dictionary happened to point to 'dada', a French word for 'hobbyhorse'. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"The answer you found on Google is related to the origin of the term \\"Dada\\" and its emergence as an art movement but does not directly answer the question about what Dada artists thought of art in past museums. So, the answer is \\"no,\\" it's not the correct answer to the specific question asked. To address the initial question, we must first understand the context and principles of the Dada movement to infer their perspectives on art in past museums. Dada was an avant-garde art movement that started around 1916 in Zurich, Switzerland, during World War I and lasted until the early 1920s. It was a reaction against the traditional cultural and aesthetic values of that time. Dada artists believed that the art world, much like the society responsible for the devastating war, was illogical, corrupt, and out of touch with the reality faced by people. The movement's primary objective was to question and ridicule artistic norms, which they believed conformed more to societal standards than genuine creativity. Dadaists sought to challenge and disrupt notions of art by emphasizing absurdity, irrationality, and spontaneity. They employed various artistic mediums such as collage, photomontage, assemblage, readymade sculptures, and even performance art. This diverse range of expressions allowed Dada artists to explore new dimensions of creativity, with the ultimate aim to break free from the conventional principles of art. Given their unconventional approach and disdain for the traditional art world, it's safe to assume that Dada artists would have had a critical perspective on art displayed in past museums. They would have considered these works as reflections of a stale and conventional culture that catered to the elite and upheld the status quo. The art found in museums, in their view, would have represented the very ideas they were rebelling against—formality, hierarchy, and mainstream cultural values. In conclusion, Dada artists likely had a negative opinion of art in past museums, as they perceived it to enforce traditional norms and aesthetic values they sought to challenge and upend. The answer you found on Google highlighted the origin of the term \\"Dada\\" but did not address the artists' views on art in past museums. By understanding the context of the Dada movement and their opposition to conventional artistic principles, we can infer their critical stance on the artworks displayed in the museums of their time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - John James Sykes (born 29 July 1959) is an English rock guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter who has played with Streetfighter, Tygers of Pan Tang, John Sloman's Badlands, Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake, and Blue Murder. Sykes co-wrote the majority of the songs on Whitesnake's 1987 self-titled album with David Coverdale. Sykes is also a successful solo artist. - Century Media Records is a heavy metal record label with offices in the United States, Germany and London. In August 2015, Century Media was acquired by Sony Music Entertainment for US 17 million. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Thin Lizzy are a rock band formed in Dublin, Ireland in 1969. Two of the founding members, drummer Brian Downey and bass guitarist and lead vocalist Phil Lynott, met while still in school. Lynott led the group throughout their recording career of twelve studio albums, writing most of the material. Thin Lizzy's most successful songs, \\"Whiskey in the Jar\\" (a traditional Irish ballad), \\"Jailbreak\\" and \\"The Boys Are Back in Town\\", were all major international hits. After Lynott's death in 1986, various incarnations of the band emerged over the years based initially around guitarists Scott Gorham and John Sykes, though Sykes left the band in 2009.

Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.

Gorham is the band member with the longest membership after founders Brian Downey (drummer) and frontman and bass guitarist, Phil Lynott. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds.

Please answer the following question: This article: The Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem. Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress. The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case. Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the \\"impious or wicked\\" had \\"remained\\" rather than \\"dwelt\\" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.Koen Decoster proposes that Josephus wrote of \\"a citadel in the lower part of the city\\" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, \\"a citadel in the lower city\\" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it. But, if I hadn't been so angry I would never have attempted it at all. Life is full of little lessons. Pay attention to them and learn. If you have to lash out, lash at solving the situation you are in instead the person who caused it. It is significantly more productive that way.

To clarify further, let's break down the meaning of these sentences. 1. \\"In 1995 , Bret Hart accused Lawler of being a racist to create problems between Hart and the Japanese wrestler Hakushi.\\" This sentence states that Bret Hart accused Lawler of racism in 1995. The purpose of this accusation was to cause problems between Bret Hart and Hakushi, a Japanese wrestler. 2. \\"Lawler accused Bret Hart in 1995 of being a racist to create problems between Hart and the Japanese wrestler Hakushi.\\" This sentence also indicates that Lawler accused Bret Hart of racism in 1995, with the intention of instigating issues between Hart and Hakushi, the Japanese wrestler. Both sentences essentially communicate the same message; the only notable distinctions are their arrangement of words and the order in which the information is presented. In the first sentence, we learn when the accusation occurred before discovering the antagonist, while the second sentence introduces the accuser before mentioning the time frame of the defamation. Despite these minor discrepancies, both statements express the underlying narrative: In 1995, Lawler made a racial accusation against Bret Hart with the intention of generating conflict between Bret Hart and a Japanese wrestler named Hakushi.

Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable. To do this, we need to get rid of the constant term on the right side of the equation. We find that a 47 is added to the right side, so we will subtract 47 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable. 21 - 47 = 13*a + 47 - 47 Step 3: Simplify the equation. -26 = 13*a Step 4: Solve for the variable. Now, we need to find the value of 'a'. Currently, it is multiplied by 13. To isolate 'a', we need to divide by 13 on both sides of the equation. -26 ÷ 13 = (13*a) ÷ 13 -2 = a Step 5: State the solution.

Washington (CNN) -- The United States is beefing up its firepower in Afghanistan by employing heavily armored tanks in Afghanistan for the first time in the nine-year war, a military spokesman said Friday. The U.S. Marine Corps plans to use a company of M1A1 Abrams tanks in restive Helmand province by early spring, Marine Maj. Gabrielle Chapin said. The M1A1 tank is the fastest and most deadly ground combat weapons system available. It will allow for more aggressive missions while mitigating risks to U.S. forces, the military said. The tanks were used successfully by U.S. forces to battle insurgents in Iraq's Anbar province, Chapin said. The company of 115","completion":"M1A1 Abrams tanks will be deployed to the volatile region of Helmand province, an area fraught with supply chain difficulties, mountainous terrain, and a strong Taliban presence. This move demonstrates the U.S. military's commitment to achieving strategic and tactical dominance in the region, as well as to support Afghan forces in their ongoing counter-insurgency efforts. The M1A1 Abrams, with its high-speed mobility, advanced targeting systems, and impressive firepower, represents a substantial escalation in capabilities for U.S. and Afghan forces and may prove to be a psychological blow to insurgents in the area. As part of the overall counter-insurgency strategy, the tanks will not only target enemy strongholds and assets but will be used to protect civilian populations, establish secure zones, and deter insurgent attacks on newly constructed infrastructure projects. While the use of tanks in Afghanistan has faced criticism due to potential risks for civilian casualties, the U.S. military has weighed this concern against the possible benefits of deploying the tanks. The M1A1 Abrams has a proven track record of success in recent conflicts, including Iraq, where its strong armor proved invaluable in protecting crew members from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). Its 120mm smoothbore main gun and advanced fire control system give it the ability to engage targets accurately at long ranges and with great precision, while its gas turbine engine allows for rapid movement across various terrains. These capabilities give the U.S. military the advantage in both stand-off engagements and close-quarters combat situations. However, the decision to deploy the M1A1 Abrams tanks in Afghanistan has not come without concerns. Operating and maintaining the tanks in such a hostile environment can be challenging, given the harsh climate, dust, and logistical issues that characterize the region. Fueling the gas turbine engines requires a significant and sustained logistics chain, and spare parts may need to be flown in due to the region's remoteness. Furthermore, the size and weight of the tanks can limit their mobility in the narrow roads and mountain passes of Afghanistan, possibly requiring extra engineering support to establish and maintain supply routes. Despite these challenges, U.S. military commanders seem confident that the benefits of using the M1A1 Abrams tanks in Afghanistan far outweigh the potential drawbacks. They are seen as a force multiplier, enabling not only increased lethality, but also better force protection and intimidation of enemy fighters, helping to disrupt and degrade the insurgents' ability to launch effective attacks and regroup. In conclusion, this deployment of M1A1 Abrams tanks in Afghanistan, though not without challenges, signifies a determination by the U.S military to ramp up its presence and capabilities in the region. It represents an important shift in strategy that may help to turn the tide in the fight against insurgency, ultimately contributing to the stabilization and security of Afghanistan and the surrounding regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What kind of thing would the answer to the question \\"What 's the proud claim to fame of the young women who formed Kappa Alpha Theta ?\\" be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What's the proud claim to fame of the young women who formed Kappa Alpha Theta?\\" would likely be a description, as it refers to a specific achievement or quality of the young women in the organization. Kappa Alpha Theta, founded in 1870, is a prominent college sorority in the United States and Canada. The young women who formed this sorority were pioneers in advancing opportunities for women in higher education and advocating for women's rights and equality. At the time of its founding, women were underrepresented and often faced challenges in pursuing educational and extracurricular activities in a male-dominated academic environment. The proud claim to fame of the young women who formed Kappa Alpha Theta would be their status as trailblazers in creating an organization that provided support, connection, and empowerment for women in higher education. They blazed a path for other women in academia, promoting the importance of female representation, sisterhood, and leadership development. Today, Kappa Alpha Theta continues to uphold these values and actively works towards fostering the growth and development of its members in various fields. Membership in the organization provides a sense of belonging and shared values based on academic excellence, personal growth, and mutual respect. Moreover, Kappa Alpha Theta has contributed to the personal and professional development of numerous accomplished women since its establishment, including former First Lady Laura Bush, actress and singer Ashley Judd, and U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, among many others. In summary, the claim to fame of the young women who formed Kappa Alpha Theta is a description that emphasizes their groundbreaking role in establishing a supportive and empowering environment for women in higher education, as well as the legacy of their sorority's commitment to upholding these values and nurturing future generations of successful female leaders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Instead, the presumptive Republican nominee unflinchingly defended the tweet on Saturday targeting Hillary Clinton, saying his staff \\"shouldn't have\\" deleted it. Later Wednesday evening, Trump tweeted a picture of a Disney movie sticker book for \\"Frozen\\" that featured a six-pointed star. \\"Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also? Dishonest media!\\" Trump tweeted. Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the 'Star of David' also? Dishonest media! #Frozen pic.twitter.com/4LJBpSm8xa Trump's comments on Wednesday revived a controversy that appeared to be quickly fading under the weight of the news that Hillary Clinton's private emails included classified information, and that she will not face charges. On a day when Clinton's controversies dominated the airwaves, Trump resurrected his own. Reached Wednesday night about Trump's latest tweet, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt, was baffled. He said there was no comparison between the star on the \\"Frozen\\" book and \\"a Jewish star superimposed on money talking about calling a candidate being corrupt.\\" \\"Just so we're clear the image originated with a white supremacist -- not with Disney animators in Burbank,\\" Greenblatt said of Trump's since-deleted tweet. Greenblatt said Trump needed to \\"simply acknowledge that millions of people were offended\\" and make it clear that anti-Semitic and racist views \\"don't have a place in the campaign.\\" Clinton's campaign also quickly jumped on the opportunity to go back on the attack, tweeting: \\"Do you want to build a strawman?\\" Do you want to build a strawman? https://t.co/AoeNTJOGpo — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 7, 2016 On Monday, the Clinton campaign knocked Trump for using a \\"blatantly anti-Semitic image\\" and criticized the de facto GOP nominee for refusing to apologize for the tweet. At his rally, Trump also repeatedly slammed the media -- including CNN -- for its coverage of the controversy during a rally with thousands of supporters in the battleground state of Ohio and accused the media of having \\"racist tendencies.\\" \\"Actually they're racially profiling. They're racially profiling. Not us. Why do they bring this up?\\" Trump said. \\"These people are sick.\\" Critics of Trump's tweet pointed out that the graphic, which featured Clinton and the star on a bed of money with the words \\"most corrupt candidate ever,\\" evoked common anti-Semitic imagery. Then, the Anti-Defamation League, a leading group in the U.S. combating anti-Semitism and bigotry, slammed Trump's use of the image and Greenblatt told CNN he had no doubt the imagery was anti-Semitic and said it was \\"the classic trope of Jews and money.\\" Trump said he was not at all mad at his social media director, Dan Scavino, who posted the tweet. Trump pointed out that Scavino's wife is Jewish. Trump also doubled down on his comments about the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, a human rights abuser whom Trump praised Tuesday night for his efficient killing of terrorists. \\"I don't love Saddam Hussein. I hate Saddam Hussein. But he was damn good at killing terrorists,\\" Trump said Wednesday. Trump also praised former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is being vetted as a potential vice presidential pick and joined him at the rally. \\"And I'm not saying anything, and I'm not telling you it's Newt or anything. But I can tell you, in one form or another, Newt Gingrich is going to be involved with our government, that I can tell you,\\" Trump said. \\"He's smart, he's tough, he gets it.\\" Gingrich, who ran in for president in 2012, spoke before Trump, hammering the Justice Department's decision to not charge Clinton over her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. \\"I cannot imagine more vivid proof of corruption,\\" Gingrich said, pointing in particular to former President Bill Clinton's impromptu meeting with U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an airport tarmac last week. Trump repeatedly referenced Gingrich after taking over the podium. \\"I'm not saying it's Newt, but if it's Newt, nobody is going to be beating him in those debates,\\" Trump said. The businessman also plugged the candidacy of a fellow Republican facing a tough re-election fight, urging his supporters at the top of his speech and in closing to \\"go out and vote for Rob Portman,\\" while slamming the Ohio senator's Democratic rival, former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland.

From a greasy-fry-up and strong coffee to 'hair of the dog' and a dose of painkillers, Britons have long sought after the perfect hangover cure. And now even the NHS has issued official advice on how to combat a hangover ― don't get drunk. Health bosses state the obvious in a 'hangover cures' guide on the taxpayer-funded NHS Choices website, dedicating a page to debunking myths about how to avoid a headache after a heavy night. The NHS has issued official advice on how to combat a hangover ― do not get drunk in the first place (file picture) The common sense advice states: 'Hangover cures are generally a myth. There are no cures for a hangover. There are tips for avoiding hangovers and for easing the symptoms. 'The best way to avoid a hangover is not to drink.' With millions preparing for a New Year knees-up on Wednesday evening, the official advice from the health service adds that drinkers should consider eating pasta or rice before they go out. The hangover guide also suggests drinking 'water or non-fizzy soft drinks in between each alcoholic drink', and drinking a pint of water before bed. The patronising tips page adds: 'If you wake up the next morning feeling terrible, you probably didn't follow this advice.' Listing methods to lessen the alcohol-induced aches and pains felt the morning after the night before, the NHS Choices page suggests taking paracetamol rather than aspirin, as the latter can cause nausea. The official advice from the health service adds that drinkers should consider eating pasta or rice before going out (file picture) The humble bacon sandwich has long been considered a hangover cure, but NHS experts suggest trying Bouillon soup instead. Other suggestions include drinking water, fizzy drinks or isotonic sports beverages to rehydrate the body. The NHS' top tip for hungover men and women is having some Bouillon soup, a thin vegetable-based broth. The soup 'is a good source of vitamins and minerals, which can top-up depleted resources. Its main advantage is that it's easy for a fragile stomach to digest,' the health experts say. 'Hair of the dog', drinking more alcohol in an attempt to drink off a hangover, does not work, the NHS say. The health experts call the alleged cure a 'risky habit', and explain that it may simply delay the appearance of hangover symptoms until the booze wears off once more. In a final piece of advice, webpage suggests waiting 48 hours after a hangover before drinking again. 'Sometimes, of course, a hangover makes that advice easier to follow,' the guide adds. Experts agree drinking water before you go to bed will help stave off some of the damaging effects of dehydration, which contributes to a hangover. But migraine specialist Andy Dowson recommends milk before bed instead.‘Drinking milk will combat many symptoms,’ he says. ‘Hangovers are thought to be triggered by low blood sugar and dehydration, both of which are potent triggers for migraine — so if you can stomach it, drink milk before sleeping. 'This will give you the volume of fluid as well as help get your blood sugar levels back up.‘Milk is also an anti-diuretic (stopping kidneys producing urine).’ This should mean fewer trips to the loo, minimising sleep disruption. The fact that milk is alkaline might also counteract any inflammation of the stomach caused by excess acidity. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

What is the sentiment of this tweet?","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be analyzed through different dimensions, such as emotional, psychological, and social aspects, among others. We can classify the sentiment into categories: positive, negative, and neutral. In this case, the sentiment appears to be mostly negative, with a hint of surprise. Let's break it down further. 1. Emotional aspect: The user seems to be experiencing negative emotions such as hurt or sadness. The words \\"mean\\" and the exclamation point at the end convey a sense of shock or disappointment, suggesting that the user is taken aback or upset by this statement from their mother. 2. Psychological aspect: In this tweet, the user could be seeking comfort or validation from their followers. It's possible that the user is asking for reassurance, hoping that others may offer support or contradict their mother's statement. 3. Social aspect: The relationship between the user and their mother plays a crucial role in the sentiment of the tweet. It showcases a potentially strained or tense relationship between the two. This may lead to sympathy from the followers, who might empathize with the user's situation. 4. Linguistic aspect: The phrasing of the tweet suggests that the user is relaying information rather than stating their own opinion, using third-person narration (\\"My mother just told me\\"). This might indicate that the user is looking to distance themselves from the hurtful comment, or it can be an effort to be objective in presenting the situation. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet is primarily negative. The user appears to be experiencing unpleasant emotions, particularly hurt or disappointment, because they have been called \\"mean\\" by their mother. However, there is also a hint of surprise and a request for reassurance or support from their followers. The tweet showcases a potentially strained relationship between the user and their mother, which may evoke sympathy and empathy from the audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Women teachers are holding back boy students by blaming them for typically male behavior, according to a new study. Women teachers are always saying that boys are \\"silly\\" in class. They refuse to \\"sit nicely like girls\\" and are more likely to be addicted to \\"schoolboy tricks\\".Women teachers may also keep low expectations of boys' academic achievement and encourage girls to work harder by letting them think they are cleverer than boys. The study suggests that under-performance among boys in most national exams could be linked to lower expectations of their women teachers. The researchers did their research mainly on women teachers, since nearly 90 percent of primary school teachers are female. According to the research, women teachers said they often found boys' play in the classroom or in the playground, such as playing with toy guns. The researcher also found that boys were often punished and urged to follow a more feminine style of play instead of being taught how to play responsibly with their favorite toys by their women teachers. Bonny Hartley, the study's lead author, said, \\"By seven or eight years old, children of both boys and girls believe that boys are less focused, less able, and less successful than girls -- and think that adults admit this idea.

Article: From strikers to center-backs, everyone needs to know individual defending. So get a partner and start playing 1v1, working on handling your man and pressuring him effectively. When defending one on one, remember to: Stay slightly crouched and on the balls of your feet. Your knees should be bent in an athletic position, allowing you to react quickly. Angle your body, with one foot ahead of the other, so that you invite the attacker to go to one side. Force them to the sideline, or to your other defenders, instead of standing straight up and letting them choose your direction. Watch a player's hips to avoid getting tricked. Your hips are your center of gravity, and they generally telegraph where a player is going unless they're Lionel Messi. It is almost impossible to quickly change your hips direction, and you can use this to your advantage as a defender. Great players are always scanning the field, especially when they have the ball. This takes practice, as it's harder to control a ball you can't see. But learning to use the bottom of your eyesight while scanning the field is an essential skill to become a smarter, and thus better, player. Use practices to work on keeping your head up. Turn the ball over now, not in games, and you'll quickly see improvement. Great players are always talking: \\"Open man,\\" \\"I've got the ball,\\" \\"I need some help,\\" and much, much more is constantly being shouted on the field, and there is a good reason. Soccer is a team game, and intelligent players know the team must be on the same page for all 90 minutes to get the most out of the game. Be a team leader and start chattering every game and practice. Essential things to talk about throughout the game include: Defensive Marks: let your team know who you're covering if you want to challenge the ball, and if there are any unmarked defenders who need to be covered. Advice to the player dribbling: don't shout tons of info at them, but don't leave them in the dark. Tell them when they have time and when there is a \\"man on.\\" Making Runs: Tell your teammate you're \\"overlapping!\\" or that \\"you can play it back\\" if they need. When you make a big run, don't assume they will always see you, especially if their head is down. Note where the players are not just when they have the ball, but off of it. What runs are people in your position making? When do they move up to attack and when do they peel back. Don't be afraid to be a bit of a critic -- use these games to learn new ideas and break down why certain things didn't work. How would you play differently, and how would you like to emulate your favorite players? Burgeoning players can also check out tutorials, clips, and highlights on YouTube, which can help fill in gaps if you're unsure what techniques the pros are using on shots or passes. Find a team or league you love and become a fan -- the more you watch the better your play will be. A big part of soccer intelligence is learning how to work as a team. While each team has specific strategies that they must develop together, there are some tactics that hold true no matter what team you're on: Contract on defense, expand on offense. This is the basis of all strategies -- you want to take away space on defense and create space when attacking. So, on defense, you come together near the center of the field, forming a unified base and moving together to prevent offensive threats. On offense, you try to make them break this base by stretching out to defend you and your team. Follow up all shots, forcing the defense to react. Even decent shots can turn into goals if your team is crashing the goal on shots and crosses. This sort of pressure can upend defenses, as defenders will face their own goal on a rebound and have a very hard time clearing it safely. Keep your shape defensively. Even if you're not playing an offside trap, the defense should be on a horizontal line, holding shape. When defenses lose this shape, they create gaps and holes between themselves. If you play in the back, always look left and right and keep everyone in a mostly even line. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of individual defending in soccer and offers tips for improving one's defensive skills. It advises players to adopt an athletic stance, angle their bodies, and observe their opponents' hips to anticipate their next move.

Please answer the following question: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. Which country would have lower labor supply in response to their taxation? A:","completion":"Based on the Laffer curve and the post-World War II taxation policies implemented by Germany and France, it is likely that France would have a lower labor supply in response to their taxation. After the war, Germany (then West Germany) mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. These governments implemented tax rates below the critical rate suggested by the Laffer curve. This approach would generally encourage labor supply growth as people are more willing to work when the tax burden is relatively low. By taxing below the critical rate, government revenue would increase as a result of an expanding labor supply due to the fact that taxes don't significantly cut into workers' earnings. On the other hand, France had mostly pro-socialist governments during the same period. These governments opted for tax rates above the critical rate. According to the Laffer curve, higher tax rates beyond the critical rate lead to lower labor supply and, in turn, a decrease in government revenue. Workers could be discouraged from entering or remaining in the labor market because a larger portion of their earnings is taken away as taxes. This is particularly true if the tax rate is perceived as prohibitively high or if other government policies also reduce the incentives to work (e.g., extensive welfare programs, early retirement policies, etc.). Furthermore, businesses operating in these countries would need to make informed decisions based on the tax environment. In Germany, the lower tax rates foster an environment more favorable to business development and growth. This, in turn, increases demand for labor. Conversely, in France, businesses may face higher costs associated with the higher tax rates and could be more reluctant to expand or invest in new ventures, indirectly affecting labor supply. Additionally, businesses may choose to relocate to countries where the tax environment is more conducive to growth, further depressing the labor supply in France. It is essential to note that other factors may impact labor supply in these countries as well (e.g., demographic trends, social policies, labor market regulations). Nonetheless, based on the principles of the Laffer curve and the post-World War II taxation policies of Germany and France, we can infer that France would likely have a lower labor supply in response to their taxation policies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Connecting the assumption to the situation In the given situation, a small nation has decided to ramp up its production capabilities by building several large factories, which would increase the industrial activity in the nation. Step 3: Applying the assumption to the situation As the industrial activity is increased due to the construction of the new factories, based on the given assumption (more industry -> more hazardous waste), the hazardous waste produced in the nation would also be expected to increase. Step 4: Estimating the impact on the river Now, we need to determine if the hazardous waste generated would affect the river next to the factories. If these factories contribute to the production of hazardous waste and if the waste management practices are not adequate, there is a risk that the hazardous waste generated would contaminate the river. Conclusion: Based on the assumption provided and the increase in industrial activity, it can be inferred that the river next to the factories would likely have more hazardous waste if proper waste management practices are not in place to prevent contamination."},{"prompt":"Article: Regrowth Poetry Competition is open to all published and unpublished, UK and non-UK based male and female writers over 16 years of age.

Summarize the following: A therapist can be helpful whether or not your vaginismus is caused by emotional or psychological issues. This is because awareness of the condition itself often produces fear and anxiety before intercourse, starting a vicious cycle that exacerbates symptoms. Feelings of depression, isolation, and lower self-esteem are also common effects of the stigma of sexual dysfunction. Treatment outcomes are much more positive when the woman and her sexual partner are motivated, cooperative, and resolve to lessen relationship conflicts. So, a couple's psychological evaluation is a great beginning to treatment. If your vaginismus is connected to anxiety issues or past sexual trauma, a therapist can help you deal with these issues so you can start to move forward. One particular type of therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can be especially helpful to some women. CBT focuses on the relationship between thoughts and behaviors, and a cognitive behavioral therapist can help you change your thoughts and behaviors regarding avoidance of sexual intercourse. One treatment for vaginismus is called exposure therapy, or flooding, and it involves gradual desensitization to penetration. Therapist-aided exposure to penetration is an effective treatment, even for women with lifelong vaginismus. The techniques for exposure usually involve vaginal penetration exercises using dilators. This is the same method used for self-treatment, with the addition of a guide who can help you continue on your own with confidence and success. Ask your doctor to refer you to a physical therapist who has experience dealing with vaginismus and other forms of female sexual dysfunction. Because the muscles of the pelvic floor play such a major role in vaginismus, physical therapy is one of the best treatment options. Your physical therapist might: teach you breathing and relaxation techniques help you learn pelvic floor muscle contraction to control your pelvic floor muscles Kegel exercises are designed to help you control the muscles of your pelvic floor. To do a Kegel exercise, you simply contract the muscles you would use to stop the flow of urine, hold for a few seconds, then relax. Aim to do about 20 contractions at a time, as many times a day as you can. Some doctors recommend doing Kegel exercises with a finger inserted into your vagina (you can work up to three fingers). Using your finger allows you to feel the muscle contracting in order to better control its movements. Your doctor may recommend vaginal dilators to use at home. These are cone-shaped instruments that are placed in the vagina. They get progressively larger, enabling the muscles of your vagina to stretch and become accustomed to penetration. To begin, bear down as you would when having a bowel movement. This helps enlarge the vaginal opening. Then, insert fingers (not the dilators yet) into your vagina, continuing to push or bear down. When you begin using the dilators, leave them in for 10 to 15 minutes. The vaginal muscles will become used to the pressure. If you have a spouse or partner, you may want to ask this person to help you insert the dilators. Women with vaginismus need to be patient and try treatment options before jumping into sexual intercourse. If you try to become sexually active right away, you may experience pain or discomfort, and this sets you up for a cycle of pain and anxiety that worsens vaginismus. It is vital that you have a patient, supportive partner. When you do try to have sex, go very slowly, use plenty of lubricant, and experiment to find the most comfortable positions. Doctors typically suggest that women hold the penetrative object and place it partially or completely in their vagina as they have done with vaginal dilators. This applies equally to penises, dildos, and vibrators.","completion":"A therapist can help with a problem called vaginismus, which makes it hard for a woman to let anything go into her private area. This problem can make a woman feel scared, sad, and alone. The therapist will help the woman and her partner understand and solve any issues they have. There are different ways a therapist can help, like teaching them to relax, control their muscles down there, and use special tools called dilators to make it easier. The woman should be patient and not rush into having private time with her partner until she feels ready. Having a caring partner and trying different ways to be comfortable can help too."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What word would an American use to describe a Calvinist church?\\" is in \\"During the Reformation, the term was hardly used outside of the German politics. The word evangelical (German: evangelisch), which refers to the gospel, was much more widely used for those involved in the religious movement. Nowadays, this word is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations, above all the ones in the German-speaking area such as the EKD. The German word evangelisch means Protestant, and is different from the German evangelikal, which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism. The English word evangelical usually refers to Evangelical Protestant churches, and therefore not to Protestantism as a whole. It traces its roots back to the Puritans in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States.

Trivia question: Although never seen in the comic book, which Peanuts character is in love with The Little Red-Haired Girl? And the answer is?","completion":"The answer to the trivia question is Charlie Brown. Charlie Brown is the main character in the long-running comic strip \\"Peanuts,\\" created by Charles M. Schulz. The strip was first published on October 2, 1950, and continued until February 13, 2000. It remains one of the most popular and influential comic strips in history, touching the hearts of millions of readers with its humor, wisdom, and iconic characters. One of the enduring storylines in the comic strip is Charlie Brown's unrequited love for a character known as the Little Red-Haired Girl. She is referred to as such because her real name is never revealed, and she is never actually shown in the comic strip itself. Schulz intentionally kept her out of the strip as a symbol of unattainable love and the idealized object of affection. Charlie Brown's crush on the Little Red-Haired Girl is a central aspect of his character, which demonstrates his vulnerability, insecurity, and shyness. Throughout the comic strip, he often daydreams about her, pines for her from afar, and expresses his feelings to his friends, particularly Linus van Pelt, who provides moral support and encouragement. Despite his love for her, Charlie Brown can never muster up the courage to talk to the Little Red-Haired Girl. His attempts to confess his feelings for her or interact with her usually end in failure, often due to comedic mishaps or his own insecurities. This enduring theme resonates with many readers who have experienced unrequited love in their lives and can relate to Charlie Brown's longing for connection and understanding. Over time, the Little Red-Haired Girl became more than just a love interest for Charlie Brown. She came to symbolize the idea of hope, ambition, and the pursuit of happiness that often seems out of reach. The character demonstrates that it is natural to strive for something that seems unattainable, and it is okay to feel vulnerable or afraid in the face of such challenges. In conclusion, the Peanuts character who is in love with the never-seen Little Red-Haired Girl is Charlie Brown, the comic strip's main character. His ongoing passion for her is a recurring theme within the stories, reflecting feelings of vulnerability, uncertainty, and hope, which has resonated with readers for generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: The four-chambered mammalian heart can pump blood in two different directions. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen. The left side of the heart pumps blood containing oxygen to the rest of the body. Because of the dual pumping action of the heart, all of the blood going to body cells is rich in oxygen. Q: How many chambers does a mammalian heart have? A: Answer:","completion":"A mammalian heart has four chambers. This complex structure allows for dual pumping action, which is essential for efficient blood circulation throughout the body. The four chambers are divided into two atria and two ventricles. The right atrium and right ventricle make up the right side of the heart, while the left atrium and left ventricle comprise the left side of the heart. This structural configuration enables the mammalian heart to pump blood in two different directions. The right side is responsible for pumping blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen through the exchange of gases that occur during respiration. Once oxygenated, the blood returns to the left side of the heart, where the left atrium collects it and subsequently passes it to the left ventricle. The left ventricle then pumps this oxygenated blood to the rest of the body, providing the essential component required for cellular respiration and, ultimately, the survival of the organism's tissues and cells. In summary, the four-chambered configuration of the mammalian heart enables efficient circulation of oxygen-rich blood throughout the body, contributing to the effective functioning of the cardiovascular system and overall well-being of the organism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. and the situation: David was visiting the natural history museum. He noticed two charts that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two time periods, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's overall climate in the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts.

Answer:","completion":"Time B would see more trapped terrestrial radiation, as there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in the present century compared to the sixteenth century (time A).

A mobile phone is a mobile phone. But can you combine the two to do something for your local environment? As early as next year it may well be possible. When you have finished with your mobile phone you will be able to bury it in the garden and wait for it to flower . A biodegradable mobile phone was, this month, introduced by scientists. It is hoped that the new type of phone will encourage users to recycle. Scientists have come up with a new material over the last five years. It looks like any other plastic and can be hard or soft, and able to change shape. Overtime it can also break down into the soil without giving out any poisonous chemicals. British researchers used the new material to develop a phone cover that includes a sunflower seed .When this new type of cover turns into waste, it forms nitrates . These feed the seed and help the flower grow. Engineers have designed a small transparent window to hold the seed. They have made sure it only grows when the phone is thrown away. \\"We've only put sunflower seeds into the cover so far. But we are working with scientists to find out which flowers would perform best. Maybe we could put roses in next time.\\" said one scientist. As phone technology is developing so quickly, people are constantly throwing their mobiles away. This means producers are under pressure to find ways of recycling them.

Like any other constantly repeated action, speaking has to be learned, but once it is learned, it becomes a generally unconscious and apparently automatic process.

There actions are learned from the particular society into which the baby is born; so that, like all conduct that is learned from a society--from the people around us--speech is a patterned activity. The meandering babble and chatter of a young child are eventually channeled by imitation into a few orderly grooves that represent the pattern accepted as meaningful by the people around him.

The sounds that a child can make are more varied and numerous than the sounds that any particular language uses.

Write highlights for this article: MIT researchers have created a camera which can take images so fast - one trillion of them in just a second - that it can capture light as it travels across objects. Nothing can go faster than the speed of light, which thanks to the work of scientific legends such as Leon Foucault and Einstein, we know to be 299,792,458 metres per second in a vacuum. But developers at MIT have managed to catch up, with their camera taking so many images that, when you play them in sequence at super-low-speed, you can see a light beam as it travels from A to B. The fascinating video below was demonstrated at a TED technology conference in Edinburgh. It shows a burst of light traveling the length of a one-litre Coke bottle, bouncing off the cap, before then reflecting back to the bottle’s bottom. Scroll down for video:. What is this? It is the first micro-micro-micro second of light photons travelling into a Coca Cola bottle. The small beam of light - just a millimetre in length - travels further up the bottle, seen thanks to the trillion-exposure camera. While it is not an advert for Coca Cola, there is something very majestic as the famous slogan comes into focus thanks to the tiny light beam. The light scatters now it is inside the bottle, and illuminates the plastic from within. Specific: The video even shows the specific moment that the cap gets illuminated. Brief illumination: The bottle begins to darken again as the light scatters onwards. First of all pointing out that Coca Cola did not sponsor this experiment, Media Lab Associate Professor Ramesh Raskar explained the physics behind the experiment to the TED crowd in Edinburgh. The team used a laser, flicking it on and off in the space of a femtosecond - or a millionth of a billionth of a second. TED Talk: Media Lab Associate Professor Ramesh Raskar during his presentation. In order to get a grip on how short this time is, an oft-quoted example is that a femtosecond is to a second what a second is to about 32 million years. The laser, turned on and off, sends out a small beam of light, measuring in length just a millimetre. The light is directed at a Coca Cola bottle in a darkened room, and the camera then film the light as it (relatively) slowly enters the bottle through the plastic bottom, moves to the far end while scattering light within the bottle, and then bounces off the bottle cap. This is the first time light has publicly been filmed moving, and could have huge repercussions in everything from photography to medical revolutions to shopping. If the technology can become cheap to produce commercially, people could carry scanners to the supermarket and check the ripeness of their fruit and vegetable, as the scanner can beam light into, say, a tomato. If a tomato is ripe, light will be absorbed into the fruit and bounce around, causing a 'glow' in a super-slow video. Unripe or old fruit would not absorb the light. Media Lab postdoc Andreas Velten, one of the system’s developers, called the camera it the 'ultimate' in slow motion. He said: 'There’s nothing in the universe that looks fast to this camera,'. See the TED video here:. The system relies on a recent technology called a streak camera, deployed in a totally unexpected way. The aperture of the streak camera is a narrow slit. Particles of. light - photons - enter the camera through the slit and are converted. into electrons, which pass through an electric field that deflects them. in a direction perpendicular to the slit. Because the electric field is changing very rapidly, it deflects the. electrons corresponding to late-arriving photons more than it does those. corresponding to early arriving ones. The image produced by the camera is thus two-dimensional, but only. one of the dimensions — the one corresponding to the direction of the. slit — is spatial. The other dimension, corresponding to the degree of. deflection, is time. The image thus represents the time of arrival of. photons passing through a one-dimensional slice of space. The camera was intended for use in experiments where light passes. through or is emitted by a chemical sample. Since chemists are chiefly. interested in the wavelengths of light that a sample absorbs, or in how. the intensity of the emitted light changes over time, the fact that the. camera registers only one spatial dimension is irrelevant. But it’s a serious drawback in a video camera. How it works: A tiny laser pulse is fired towards an object, such as a coke bottle or a brick wall. Explanation: The tiny beam of light (pictured center) travels towards the wall. When the light hits an object, in this case a wall, it scatters in a thousand directions. To produce their super-slow-mo videos, Velten, Media Lab Associate. Professor Ramesh Raskar and Moungi Bawendi, the Lester Wolfe Professor. of Chemistry, must perform the same experiment - such as passing a light. pulse through a bottle - over and over, continually repositioning the. streak camera to gradually build up a two-dimensional image. Synchronising the camera and the laser that generates the pulse, so. that the timing of every exposure is the same, requires a battery of. sophisticated optical equipment and exquisite mechanical control. It takes only a nanosecond - a billionth of a second - for light to. scatter through a bottle, but it takes about an hour to collect all the. data necessary for the final video. For that reason, Raskar calls the new system 'the world’s slowest fastest camera.' After an hour, the researchers accumulate hundreds of thousands of. data sets, each of which plots the one-dimensional positions of photons. against their times of arrival. Raskar, Velten and other members of. Raskar’s Camera Culture group at the Media Lab developed algorithms that. can stitch that raw data into a set of sequential two-dimensional. images.","completion":"1.

Given the two facts above, what requires either insects or wind.? A:","completion":"Given the two facts presented above, the process of pollination requires either insects or wind to be effectively accomplished for most plant species. To provide a detailed and long answer, we will delve into the significance of pollination and the roles played by insects and wind in this process. Pollination is an essential process in the sexual reproduction of plants, involving the transfer of pollen from male structures (anthers) to female structures (stigmas) within flowers or between different flowers. This transfer allows fertilization to occur, leading to the formation of seeds and fruit, which are crucial for the reproduction and perpetuation of plant species. Effective pollination helps plants maintain genetic diversity and adaptability to environmental changes. There are several types of pollination, but we will focus on the two most common: insect pollination (entomophily) and wind pollination (anemophily), as mentioned in the facts provided. 1. Insect Pollination (Entomophily): Insect pollination is a type of biotic pollination that relies on the activity of insects like bees, butterflies, moths, beetles, and flies visiting flowers. These insects are usually attracted to flowers by various factors such as the color, shape, scent, and nectar or pollen rewards offered by the plants. In the process of feeding on or collecting these rewards, the insects inadvertently transfer pollen from one flower to another. Some plants have evolved highly specialized features to ensure their pollination by specific insect species, forming symbiotic relationships. Insect pollination is highly efficient, as insects tend to visit many flowers during their foraging activities, which maximizes the chances of pollen being transferred to compatible flowers and facilitates outcrossing and genetic diversity. In addition, many agricultural crops rely on insect pollination to produce the fruits and seeds that constitute a significant portion of the human diet. 2. Wind Pollination (Anemophily): Wind pollination is an abiotic form of pollination that depends on air currents to facilitate the transfer of pollen between flowers. Plants adapted to wind pollination often produce large quantities of lightweight, dry, and smooth pollen grains, which can easily be carried by the wind. They may also have small, inconspicuous flowers with stamens and stigmas that protrude outside to maximize the chances of pollen release and capture. Anemophily is prevalent in grasses, conifers, and some deciduous trees, which produce a significant amount of pollen during their flowering season. While wind pollination is less precise and can result in considerable pollen waste, it enables plant species to reproduce effectively in the absence of insect pollinator populations. In conclusion, given the facts provided, it is evident that the process of pollination, specifically for most plant species, requires either insects or wind. These two modes of pollination undoubtedly play crucial roles in ensuring the continuity and diversity of plant ecosystems, as well as the availability of food resources for humans and wildlife."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My friend loved her laptop a lot more than her computer, because the","completion":"laptop offered unparalleled convenience, portability, and versatility that significantly enhanced her overall computing experience. There are several reasons why my friend preferred her laptop over her computer, which can also be referred to as a desktop computer in this context. These reasons, which are not limited to but include the following, effectively contributed to her propensity for using her trusty laptop: 1. Portability: One of the primary advantages of a laptop is its portability. Unlike desktop computers, which are often large, bulky, and tethered to a specific location, laptops can be easily transported from one place to another. This enabled my friend to not only work from the comfort of her own home but also make use of her laptop during her commute, at coffee shops, and even on vacation. The ease with which she could take her laptop with her made it a far more attractive option compared to her computer, which remained stationary at all times. 2. Versatility: Laptops are designed to be versatile devices that can be used in various environments and circumstances. My friend appreciated the fact that she could use her laptop for work, study, gaming, and entertainment purposes. The built-in webcam and microphone, for example, allowed her to easily participate in video conferences or online classes without the need for additional accessories. Additionally, the laptop's diverse array of available software made it possible for her to complete tasks with ease, which would have been cumbersome or time-consuming on her computer. 3. Space-saving design: The compact nature of a laptop is beneficial, particularly for individuals who live in small homes or shared spaces. My friend valued the fact that her laptop occupied significantly less space than her computer. It didn't require an elaborate set-up, including a separate monitor, mouse, keyboard, and a range of cables and wires. This not only reduced clutter but also provided her with more room to work and live comfortably. 4. Energy efficiency: Generally speaking, laptops tend to consume less power than desktop computers. This factor was important to my friend, as it allowed her to save on energy costs while also reducing her carbon footprint. As an environmentally conscious individual, it made sense for her to choose a laptop over her computer, whenever possible. 5. All-in-one package: Laptops come equipped with a screen, keyboard, trackpad, and a multitude of essential components, such as memory, storage, and processing power. My friend appreciated the all-in-one nature of her laptop, as it consolidated her computing needs into one neat package without sacrificing functionality. In summary, my friend's preference for her laptop over her computer can be attributed to the device's portability, versatility, space-saving design, energy efficiency, and all-in-one convenience. These factors combined to make her laptop an indispensable tool that greatly contributed to a seamless and enjoyable computing experience, far surpassing what her computer could offer."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two sexually active men are currently at the doctor getting checked for sexually transmitted diseases. Before performing the actual tests, the doctor takes a brief physical examination of the men. The doctor notices that Jake's heart is beating irregularly and his arm appears to have a rash on it. While examining Scully, the doctor takes note of how yellow Scully's eyes are, and Scully also reports to the doctor that he has been throwing up lately. After the physical, the doctor has the men both pee into a cup so that he can run a standard STD test for them. and a hint : Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B. Please answer this question : Does Scully have a higher or lower chance than Jake of contracting liver cancer? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided and the symptoms exhibited by both individuals, Scully has a higher chance of contracting liver cancer than Jake. The reasoning behind this conclusion is as follows: 1. The hint provided mentions that Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver, which can be passed through sexual activity, and may cause vomiting and yellowing of the skin and eyes. Scully exhibits symptoms consistent with Hepatitis B, such as yellow eyes and vomiting. 2. The hint also states that people who are sick with Hepatitis B for the rest of their lives are at an increased risk of liver damage, which may lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. 3. Jake has an irregular heartbeat and a rash on his arm, but these symptoms do not seem related to Hepatitis B or liver cancer. Considering the symptoms present in Scully and the information provided about Hepatitis B, it is concluded that Scully has a higher chance of contracting liver cancer compared to Jake. Of course, the doctor would need to perform additional tests to confirm the presence of Hepatitis B in Scully and to further assess Jake's heart condition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The day after the Britain's Got Talent finals, Max Clifford, speaking for Simon Cowell, said that it was \\"quite possible\\" that Cowell would be signing some of the finalists, including Smith. Though she did not sign with Syco, Cowell's record label, she did record a duet of \\"Walking in the Air\\" with Johnston, which appeared on his debut album, One Voice, and was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. Before the release of One Voice, it was revealed that Smith and her father were finalising the details of her record deal. In November, it was announced that Smith would be performing on stage in Kettering with Sylvia Berryman, a vocal tutor who had worked with Smith prior to her appearance on Britain's Got Talent. Smith said that she was \\"really looking forward to singing locally again\\", and it was again reported that Smith hoped to soon sign her own record deal.In December 2008 the Daily Mail reported that Smith had signed a £2.3 million, multi-album deal with Universal Music Group that was the \\"most lucrative recording contract ever handed to a schoolgirl\\". Smith said \\"I'm honoured to be joining such a fantastic record company, especially since it's where [Jenkins] started.\\" Dickon Stainer, speaking on behalf of Universal, said \\"as soon as we saw Faryl, it became an ambition to sign her.\\" Universal claimed it intended to market Smith as a pop star.

He lived in a big country called Yugoslavia, where people from different places and backgrounds lived together. Mladic had a sad childhood because his father was killed by some bad people called Croatian Nazis. When Mladic grew up, he became a military leader.

This battle was known as a siege, where they surrounded the city and made it very difficult for anyone to come in or go out. Many people in the city were very sad and scared because of the siege. Later, Mladic and his soldiers had another battle. This time, it was in a place called Srebrenica. Srebrenica was a small town with lots of people living there. Mladic was in charge of the attack, and some very bad things happened during this time. Because of the things that happened in Sarajevo and Srebrenica, Mladic is wanted by important people who make sure everyone follows the rules.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to center yourself in meditation Develop your motivation and inspiration first. Where most meditations fail is because the motivation is absent. Often people will try to meditate without motivation and it invariably stays dry and uninteresting.","completion":"To truly delve deep into your meditation practice and experience its transformative potential, you must fuel your journey with a genuine sense of purpose and a burning desire for personal growth. Begin by asking yourself why you want to meditate, what you hope to achieve, and how it can positively impact your life and the lives of those around you. Identify the core reason or intention that drives you - it could be stress relief, inner peace, increased mindfulness, enhanced focus, better relationships, spiritual awakening, or any other worthwhile pursuit. Once you have a clear understanding of what drives your meditation practice, the next step is to cultivate inspiration. One way to do this is by surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals or finding a meditation group that resonates with your personal beliefs and goals. Alternatively, immerse yourself in books, podcasts, documentaries, or talks by meditation teachers and thought leaders who inspire and challenge you. These sources of knowledge will not only provide valuable wisdom and advice, but they can also rekindle your motivation and determination when it falters. With your motivation and inspiration solidly in place, you can now create a comfortable and serene environment for your meditation practice. Choose a quiet, uncluttered space where you can sit with your spine straight and feel relaxed but alert. Establishing a routine – including setting a consistent time, duration, and location for your meditation – will support your motivation and practice as well. As you begin your meditation session, focus on your breath as a means of connecting with your body and bringing your awareness to the present moment. Take deep, deliberate breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth, letting go of any mental or physical tension with each breath. Use this time to recall your motivation and inspiration for meditating, and envision how successfully integrating meditation into your daily life will help you reach your goals. Once you feel grounded and connected to the present, gently guide your awareness towards your thoughts and emotions. Pay close attention to the quality of your thoughts and observe them without judgment. The goal is to cultivate a non-reactive state of mind that allows thoughts to come and go without attachment or aversion, thus helping you build equanimity and emotional resilience over time. Remember, meditation is an ongoing journey of personal growth and discovery. As you progress, you may encounter moments of self-doubt or frustration – but these moments are simply part of the learning process. Stay connected to your motivation and inspiration, and be gentle and kind to yourself as you continue to develop your meditation practice. Over time, you will find that maintaining a centered and balanced state of mind becomes second nature, ultimately leading to greater overall well-being and a more authentic, fulfilling life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Which TV spy, who first became famous in the 60’s, did Henry Cavill play In a 2015 film?","completion":"Henry Cavill portrayed the character of Napoleon Solo in the 2015 film \\"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\" The movie, directed by Guy Ritchie, is a cinematic adaptation of the popular 1960s television series of the same name, which initially aired on NBC from 1964 to 1968. The character of Napoleon Solo, a debonair and resourceful secret agent, first gained fame through this TV series. The TV show \\"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\" revolved around the adventures of two spies, Napoleon Solo (originally played by Robert Vaughn) and Illya Kuryakin (portrayed by David McCallum). They were agents of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement (U.N.C.L.E.), a secret international intelligence agency working to maintain global peace and order. U.N.C.L.E. agents frequently faced off against a variety of nefarious organizations, most notably T.H.R.U.S.H., a malevolent criminal group with ambitions of world domination. In Guy Ritchie's 2015 film adaptation, Henry Cavill took on the legendary role of Napoleon Solo, while Armie Hammer portrayed his partner and Russian counterpart Illya Kuryakin. The movie retained the original series' key elements, such as its spy-themed action, humor, and distinct '60s vibe. Set during the Cold War era, the film followed the duo as they teamed up to thwart a criminal organization attempting to create and sell nuclear weapons. Henry Cavill's portrayal of Napoleon Solo brought a fresh and modern take on the character to the big screen. The film capitalized on Cavill's suave charm, wit, and physicality, effectively capturing the essence and iconic status of the original 1960s TV version. Although the movie received mixed reviews from critics, many praised the chemistry between Cavill and Hammer, as well as the stylish, retro-inspired visuals and the homage paid to the TV series. In conclusion, the TV spy from the 1960s who was portrayed by Henry Cavill in a 2015 film is Napoleon Solo from \\"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\" Having originated in the television series that ran from 1964 to 1968, the character was revitalized and reintroduced to a new generation of fans through Guy Ritchie's adaptation, with Cavill's performance being an integral element of the film's success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is also agreed that \\"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\\". But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \\"the earth before it was accursed\\".

But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).\\"?

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

I wanted to provide the citizens of Ankh-Morpork with accurate and unbiased information about the events happening around them. In a world where lies and deception often skew the truth, I believed it was high time for someone to step up and try to make a difference.\\" Vimes' eyes narrowed as he considered the honesty and determination behind William's statement. The silence that settled between them was suddenly interrupted by a faint rumble in the distance. They both knew the volcano was slowly waking up, and it was only a matter of time before it unleashed its destructive power upon the little village and its unsuspecting inhabitants. The tension in the room was nearly as palpable as the fear and apprehension settling in the hearts of the villagers outside. \\"Why did you choose to write about the impending eruption?\\" Vimes asked, his gaze still fixed on the young journalist. \\"You could have easily focused on any number of other stories.

For a moment, his mind drifted to the simple lives of the people who lived there—soon to be upended by the unforgiving wrath of nature. \\"I chose this story, Commander, because I believe it's essential to inform the public of potential threats, no matter how frightening they may be.

Ultimately, I want the Times to be seen as the beacon of truth and trust it was intended to be – both for the good news and the bad.\\" Vimes nodded, understanding that what William had built went beyond just another newspaper. Instead, the Times represented hope, transparency, and a dedicated effort towards the betterment of Ankh-Morpork and its people. It was evident that every story printed within its pages, be it about the heartwarming tales of everyday heroes or a looming disaster like the volcanic eruption, was chosen with a sense of responsibility and respect for the power that accurate information carries in the wild, tangled world they inhabited. As the conversation drew to a close, the rumble from the volcano grew louder—an ominous reminder of the devastation looming over the village. William stood, preparing to leave and do what he did best: tell stories that mattered. With a newfound sense of urgency and unwavering determination, Ankh-Morpork's influential editor-in-chief walked out of Vetinari's office and into the unknown, his heart anchored by the knowledge that the pursuit of truth is always worth the danger and sacrifices it entails. As the volcano's eruption drew nearer, both William de Worde and the Times would continue to play a crucial role in understanding, documenting, and ultimately shaping the outcome of the disaster. In the midst of chaos and fear, they stood as a testament to the unyielding strength of a free press and the fundamental human right to be informed, driving home the point that even in the darkest of times, the beacon of truth will never cease to shine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Prolonged exposure to UV-B light can cause sunburn, and there are worries that damage to the ozone layer may lead to an increase in the incidence of skin cancer. Can we infer the following? UV-B light is damaging the ozone layer.","completion":"From the given information, we cannot directly infer that UV-B light is damaging the ozone layer. However, we can discuss their roles and relationship. UV (ultraviolet) light is a type of electromagnetic radiation that is divided into three categories: UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C. UV-B light, which makes up only a small fraction of the sun's rays (around 5%), is known for its adverse effects on human health, such as sunburn and skin cancer. On the other hand, the ozone layer is a stratum in the Earth's atmosphere that contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) molecules, mainly located in the lower part of the stratosphere. The ozone layer plays a vital role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, including the vast majority of UV-B rays. In doing so, it prevents these harmful rays from reaching the Earth's surface and causing damage to living beings, including humans. It is important to note that the relationship between UV-B light and the ozone layer is not that UV-B is causing damage to the layer. Instead, it is human-made chemicals, like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that have been implicated in ozone depletion. When CFCs are released into the atmosphere due to various human activities, they react with the ozone molecules and cause a decrease in ozone concentrations. This depletion of the ozone layer leads to an increase in the amount of harmful UV-B rays reaching the Earth's surface, which, in turn, elevates the risk of skin cancer and other health issues. As concerns regarding the ozone layer depletion and its consequences have grown, steps have been taken, such as the Montreal Protocol, to mitigate the release of ozone-depleting substances and protect the ozone layer. As a result, there has been a gradual decrease in the use of CFCs, and the ozone layer has started to show signs of recovery. In conclusion, while it is true that damage to the ozone layer may lead to an increase in the incidence of skin cancer due to higher levels of UV-B radiation, the statement that UV-B light is damaging the ozone layer is inaccurate. It is the release and accumulation of human-made chemicals, like CFCs, that contribute to ozone depletion, and ultimately, the increase in harmful UV-B exposure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pay attention to any potential signs of aggression when you're near a goose. At first, a goose will bend its head back slightly. This indicates aggression. If the goose then bends its neck out straight, this shows the aggression is increasing. If a goose is about to attack, it will pump its head up and down. Geese may hiss or honk as well if they are becoming aggressive. If you notice warning signs of an attack, leave before the goose begins to chase you. If the goose sees you're backing away, it may decide you're not a threat. Back away slowly until you're a good distance from the goose and it's stopped making aggressive gestures. In the event the goose starts chasing you, back away slowly. Stay faced towards the goose and use your peripheral vision to guide your movements. Make sure to avoid anything you may trip over, as this may give the goose reason to attack. If you appear frightened or upset, a goose could take this as a sign of aggression. It's a good idea to maintain a calm, neutral demeanor when backing away from a goose. If you're struggling to remain calm, take a few deep breaths as you back away. Keep in mind that, while geese can be territorial, an actual physical attack is very rare. In the event a goose bites you or hits you with its wings, seek medical attention.

It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces.

Justin Ross Harris and his son Cooper. Facebook via WXIA Prosecutors allege Harris was having marital problems and left Cooper to die on purpose because he wanted a child-free life. His wife, Leanna, filed for divorce last month. Harris had already been charged with three counts of sending inappropriate texts to underage girls in the original 2014 indictment against him for Cooper's death. His defense team has argued that those allegations, even if they're true, have no connection to his son's death. Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution the latest indictment couldn't wait. “Had the state delayed charging any further, prosecution of some of the charges would have barred by the statute of limitations,” he said. ||||| Georgia Dad Accused in Hot Car Death Indicted on Charges of Sexually Exploiting Minors A Georgia dad, set to go to trial in April on charges he intentionally left his toddler son to die in a hot car in 2014, was indicted last week on charges he sexually exploited minors, NBC News reports Harris was indicted by a Cobb County grand jury on two counts of sexual exploitation of children and six counts of disseminating harmful material to minors, according to the network.\\"The indictment is stemming from an alleged exchange of lewd photos with two underage girls and sending nude photos to another underage girl, and then engaging in sexually explicit conversations with all three from January to May 2014,\\" according to the network.Harris was previously indicted for malice murder, among other charges, in the death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Cooper died on June 18, 2014 , after being left for hours in an SUV in the parking lot of Home Depot, where Harris worked, authorities have said.Harris has maintained the death was an accident.

Harris’ attorney, Maddox Kilgore, questioned whether the eight-count indictment — two counts of sexually exploiting children and six of disseminating harmful material to a minor — was a “calculated maneuver to inflame public opinion against Ross” just five weeks before jury selection in the murder trial. Harris, who goes on trial April 11, is charged with intentionally leaving his son, Cooper, to die in the back of a sweltering SUV in June 2014. » Listen to Breakdown Season 2 on the Justin Ross Harris case here. “Despite possessing Ross Harris’ cell phone for almost two years, the Cobb County district attorney has only now chosen to indict Ross for some alleged consensual electronic communications,” Kilgore said in a statement. In the new indictment, Harris is accused of possessing lewd photographs of two underage girls, sending nude photos to those girls and one other and engaging in sexually explicit chats with all three. Cobb District Attorney Vic Reynolds said the timing was unavoidable. The new indictment was made possible by “advances in electronic forensic analysis in conjunction with recent interviews of newly discovered victims,” he said. “Had the state delayed charging any further, prosecution of some of the charges would have barred by the statute of limitations,” Reynolds said. Harris will be tried separately on the latest charges which, according to prosecutors, should not delay the murder trial. The defense had previously moved — unsuccessfully — to separate charges related to Harris’ extramarital dalliances from the more serious counts, including malice murder, felony murder and cruelty to children. But the state argued in pretrial hearings that his sexting with other women was crucial to understanding motive. Neither side denies Harris was actively engaged in sexual online chats with numerous women. Cobb Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified in October that Harris sent 40,000 texts using the Whisper messaging app alone. Family was a “hurdle that stood in the way of Harris’ desire to be with as many women as possible,” Cobb Assistant District Attorney Chuck Boring said at a motions hearing in October. Prosecutors also revealed that, just 10 minutes before he last saw his son Cooper alive, Harris responded sympathetically to a social media post written by an anonymous mother lamenting her decision to have children. “I love my son and all,” Harris wrote on the morning of June 18, 2014. “But we both need escapes.” Kilgore has long contended the state is trying to poison the well against his client. He repeated that charge on Friday. “After more than a 20-month investigation into every imaginable detail of Ross Harris’ life, this new indictment alleges no acts of cruelty, no deprivation, no abuse, nor any neglect of Cooper,” Kilgore said. “The content and timing of this indictment confirms the absence of such evidence, and it signals the state’s desperation to convict Ross of the worst mistake any of us as parents could make.” Harris pleaded not guilty to all charges in the first indictment.

Information: - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. - In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei). The fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay. - In materials science, ductility is a solid material's ability to deform under tensile stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire. Malleability, a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling. Both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity, the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture. Also, these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by Percy Williams Bridgman as part of his Nobel Prize-winning work on high pressures). - Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains. Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container, i. e. the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces. - In nuclear physics, nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei come close enough to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles (neutrons and/or protons). The difference in mass between the products and reactants is manifested as the release of large amounts of energy. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic \\"binding energy\\" between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers active or \\"main sequence\\" stars, or other high magnitude stars. - Neutron radiation is a kind of ionizing radiation which consists of free neutrons. A result of nuclear fission or nuclear fusion, it consists of the release of free neutrons from atoms, and these free neutrons react with nuclei of other atoms to form new isotopes, which, in turn, may produce radiation. - The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics. - The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume. The symbol most often used for density is (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter \\"D\\" can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume: - Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos ( \\"equal\\") and topos ( \\"place\\"), meaning \\"the same place\\"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table. - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale). - Embrittlement is a loss of ductility of a material, making it brittle. Various materials have different mechanisms of embrittlement. - Neutron - induced swelling is the increase of volume and decrease of density of materials subjected to intense neutron radiation . Neutrons impacting the material 's lattice rearrange its atoms , causing buildup of dislocations , voids , and Wigner energy . Together with the resulting strength reduction and embrittlement , it is a major concern for materials for nuclear reactors . Materials show significant differences in their swelling resistance . See also : Radiation hardening What entity does 'neutron-induced swelling' has the relation 'instance of' with?","completion":"Neutron-induced swelling, as an occurrence or phenomenon, is an instance of the broader concept of radiation effects on materials, specifically nuclear materials. Radiation effects on materials encompass various changes that occur in materials due to exposure to radiation, particularly ionizing radiation like neutron radiation. These can include dimensional changes (like swelling), changes in material properties (like embrittlement), changes at the atomic or molecular level (like displacement of atoms and formation of voids), etc. So, the entity that 'neutron-induced swelling' has the 'instance of' relationship with is 'Radiation Effects on Materials'. This entity encompasses various phenomena related to the alteration of materials under the impact of different forms of radiation. The alterations can occur in physical, chemical, or mechanical properties of materials. Each specific effect, like neutron-induced swelling, is an instance of these radiation effects on materials. Furthermore, neutron-induced swelling also falls under the category of radiation damage, which involves the deleterious effects of radiation on materials. These negative effects can happen in any environment where there is significant radiation, but they are especially studied and observed in relation to materials used in the construction and operation of nuclear reactors. So another entity with which neutron-induced swelling may have an 'instance of' relationship could arguably be 'Radiation Damage'. The study and understanding of such effects are vital for the safe and effective operation of nuclear technology, both existing and future. This includes not only power generation, but also other applications of nuclear technology such as medical equipment, research facilities, and more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A famous American John Muir said in 1898: \\"The Grand Canyon... as unearthly in the color and grandeur of its architecture as if you had found it after death on some other star.\\" Like Muir, those of us who stand along the rim are prompted to wonder about the unearthliness and the forces that created and are still changing this place. After more than 100 years of studies, many things are still mysterious. Today visitors come by the thousands -- the great and simple of the earth -- all in a spirit of wonder. Travelers come from every state of the Union, from every country in Europe and Asia. From the depths of the canyon comes welling silence. Seldom can you hear the roar of the river, for all sounds are swallowed in this gulf of space. \\"It makes one want to murmur.\\" A woman once whispered to her companion. This silence is not the silence of death; rather, it is a presence. It is like a great piece of music. But music made of man works up to a climax and stops. Now, visitors to the South Rim alone may number 18,000 in a single day. Some of that number will travel by mule train down Bright Angel Trail to the canyon's floor, cross the raging river by a suspension bridge and walk to the North Rim. Though the two rims face each other across only 12 miles, it is a journey of 214 miles by car from one to the other. Nor can you visit the North Rim except in summer; some 1,200 feet higher than the South Rim, it is snow covered much of the year except in July and August. But there is no day that you may not visit the South Rim and find the sun warm on your face and the air perfumed with the incense of smoke from an Indian hearth . No wonder an American writer and journalist said, \\"I came here an atheist , and departed a devout believer.\\" Question: What is it that attracts so many travelers to the Canyon? - The unearthliness and the grandeur of its architecture. - The presence of American super stars. - The saying made by American writers and journalists. - The roaring of the river in the Canyon.

A majority of working women remain in full charge of their home; they come back at night to the cleaning, washing, and cooking that constitute their second career. But more and more husbands are sharing the burden and willingly taking on chores that their fathers would have rejected as unmanly, and as too mysteriously difficult anyway. In such cases, man and wife become equal partners, both working outside, both pushing the vacuum cleaner, actually, the number of husbands who do help that way is much smaller than the number of those who accept the idea in theory. _ . The marriage can be destroyed when the wife is more successful in her profession than her husband in his, particularly when she earns more than he does. Sociologists see in this situation one of the main reasons for the increase in the divorce rate-another reason being the husband's refusal to help with the housework or the care of the children. A third reason could be the growing awareness of the professional woman that she doesn't hare to remain married if she is too unhappy.

It has been used by Winston Churchill to give driving lessons, served in the Second World War as a recovery truck and gained international fame in hit TV series The Avengers. Now, after decades rusting away in a garage, this 1923 Silver Ghost Rolls Royce has been restored to its former glory - and is thought to be worth a cool £250,000. The vintage motor is said to have served the former British Prime Minister when he used it to give driving lessons to the first female MP, Lady Astor, on a Kent estate. Just like new: Classic car restorer Charlie Tope with the 1923 Silver Ghost Rolls Royce, once used by Sir Winston Churchill, which had been deteriorating in a garage for decades. Fit for the road again: The engine of the restored Rolls Royce, which was also used in TV show The Avengers and as a recovery truck during the Second World War. During the war years, its back end was cut off to convert it into a recovery truck with a mini crane bolted on to the chassis for the auxiliary fire and ambulance service in Manchester. And in the 1960s, the Rolls appeared in 18 episodes of the Avengers as the car of choice for English gentleman character John Steed. During the series, the classic car had a steak cooked on her engine and a ladder smashed through the windscreen. But after the show the Rolls was forgotten about - and sat deteriorating in a Sussex garage until earlier this year. Proud: Mr Tope has spent the last six months painstakingly restoring the classic car. Rich heritage: The car was apparently used by Sir Winston Churchill to give Britain's first female MP driving lessons in Kent. It had been purchased for just £200 in the early 1950s by the grandfather of Tania Turner, from Sussex. He spent £2,000 on restoring the vehicle, but sadly left it in his garage for decades before passing it on to Mrs Turner and husband Andy. They enlisted the help of classic car expert Charlie Tope to return the Rolls to the open road. Mr Turner said: 'A friend had his old Alvis restored by Charlie and we thought he would be the ideal person to tackle the Rolls. She looks absolutely fantastic - better than new.' International fame: During the 1960s, the vehicle appeared in The Avengers as the car of choice for English gentleman John Steed (above) Mr Tope, from Modbury, Devon, has spent the last six months carefully restoring the vintage vehicle and is proud of the result. He said: 'It's been a wonderful project but when I took it on I don't think I realised how big a task it would be. 'She may be a car designed for only a couple of passengers but at 16ft long and 7ft wide she is more like a small lorry.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"There is an old car called Silver Ghost Rolls Royce, made in 1923, that has a very special history. Winston Churchill, an important man from the past, used it to teach a lady named Lady Astor how to drive. During a big war, the car was changed and used for helping people. It also came out in a famous TV show long time ago, where it got a little damaged. The car was left alone in a garage for many years, but a man named Charlie Tope fixed it up and made it look new again. Now, the car is shiny and can be driven on the road, and its worth a lot of money!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Let us analyze both the statements to understand how they differ from each other.

As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others.

The band's line-up consists of Roddy Woomble (lead vocals), Rod Jones (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Newton (drums), Andrew Mitchell (bass) and Luciano Rossi (keyboards). To date, Idlewild have released seven full-length studio albums, with their latest, Everything Ever Written, released in February 2015. Initially, Idlewild's sound was faster and more dissonant than many of their 1990s indie rock contemporaries. Jones released his debut solo album, A Sentimental Education, in 2009. In 2010, Jones founded The Fruit Tree Foundation, alongside Emma Pollock (The Delgados), in order to raise awareness of mental health problems. Jones released his second solo album, A Generation Innocence, in August 2012; however, while writing for the second album, Jones encountered a hurdle at the halfway mark, as he discovered that he was not satisfied with any of the material that he had written thus far. In 2011, Jones explained, \\"I was a bit fed up with the whole folk music thing - I mean every man and his dog was doing the faux folk thing\\"--Jones then proceeded to learn the drums and eventually formed the band, The Birthday Suit, to record the material that he had created in the period following the drumming diversion. In late 2011, Jones formed The Birthday Suit and described the band as \\"essentially a solo project ... It's an ever-changing bistro of musicians.\\" The band released its debut album, The Eleventh Hour, in October 2011. The Birthday Suit's second studio album, A Conversation Well Rehearsed was released on 3 December 2012. The album was listed in 19th place in the Clean Slate Music website's \\"Top 21 Albums of 2012\\" list, although the website wrote that the second album \\"doesn't carry the punch\\" of the band's debut album. In 2006, Woomble worked with several musicians including Kate Rusby, his wife Ailidh Lennon, songwriter Karine Polwart (to whom he presented the Horizon Award at the BBC Folk Awards 2005, and with whom he performed at Celtic Connections) and Idlewild guitarist Rod Jones on his debut solo album My Secret is My Silence, produced by John McCusker. The album was released in July 2006, and Woomble toured the United Kingdom in support of the album's release. My Secret is my Silence reached number one in the UK Folk Charts, and a year later, on 10 July 2007, My Secret is my Silence was released in the United States on 7-10 Music. Woomble's follow-up album, Before the Ruin, written and recorded with Kris Drever and John McCusker, was released on 15 September 2008 through Navigator Records.

It is a lively comedy, remarkably requiring 14 singers six men and eight women. The libretto had first been offered in 1871 to Offenbach; the title also went through various permutations (\\"Le Talon rouge\\", \\"Si le Roi le savait\\", \\"Le Roi le sait\\") before settling on its final name.

Answer the following question: Translation reads the genetic code in mRNA and makes a protein, and every protein is a translated gene. Given these facts, what is the genetic code in mRNA that can be translated among the following options: - made - SO2 - alleles - water - a gene - carbonic acid - genetic drift - complex Answer:","completion":"Among the given options, the correct answer is \\"a gene.\\" The genetic code in mRNA that can be translated is indeed based on the information stored in a gene. However, to provide a comprehensive understanding, let us discuss the process of translation and how it relates to the genetic code in mRNA. The genetic code is the set of rules that the cell's machinery follows to convert or translate the information encoded in the nucleotide sequence of mRNA into a corresponding amino acid sequence for protein synthesis. This code consists of a triplet code, where three nucleotides, called codons, represent one amino acid. In total, there are 64 possible codons, which code for 20 different amino acids and 3 stop signals. The process of translation can be mainly divided into three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. Here's a detailed explanation of each stage: 1. Initiation: The process begins with the formation of the initiation complex, consisting of the small ribosomal subunit, an initiator tRNA molecule carrying the first amino acid (usually methionine) and an mRNA molecule. The small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA, and the initiator tRNA binds to the mRNA's start codon (AUG). 2. Elongation: In this phase, the large ribosomal subunit attaches to the small subunit, forming a complete ribosome complex. The codons in the mRNA are read sequentially by the ribosome, attracting corresponding tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids. The amino acids are then linked through peptide bonds, gradually creating the growing polypeptide chain. 3. Termination: The process of translation ends when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) on the mRNA. This signals the termination, and the newly synthesized polypeptide chain is released from the tRNA and ribosome. The ribosome dissociates into its subunits, and the mRNA is released for potential re-use or degradation. Now, let us justify the answer based on the provided options: - made: This term is not related to the genetic code in mRNA. - SO2: This is a chemical formula for sulfur dioxide and is irrelevant to the genetic code in mRNA. - alleles: Although alleles contain genetic information, they refer to alternative forms of a gene, not the specific code in mRNA. - water: This term refers to a molecule (H2O) and has no connection to the genetic code in mRNA. - carbonic acid: This is an inorganic compound (H2CO3) and not related to the genetic code in mRNA. - genetic drift: This term refers to the random changes in allele frequencies within a population over time, not the genetic code in mRNA. - complex: This term is too general and does not refer to the genetic code in mRNA. In conclusion, the genetic code in mRNA that can be translated is based on a gene's information, which is then converted into a functional protein through the process of translation. The genetic code consists of codons, which are groups of three nucleotides that correspond to specific amino acids. These amino acids are then linked to form a polypeptide chain, eventually giving rise to a functional protein."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Researchers used high-speed cameras to show exactly how the fly positioned itself to capture a moving target in mid-air. The results are published in the journal Current Biology. Paloma Gonzalez-Bellido from Cambridge University explained that, normally, \\"when we think of hunting animals we think of excellent vision and speed, but when you're so very tiny, you have a very small brain and limited sensory capacity\\". She added: \\"We wanted to know how [this fly manages] this predatory behaviour.\\" Dr Gonzalez-Bellido and her colleagues created a miniature outdoor studio - filming the fly from two angles to capture its movement in 3D. They discovered that the fly maintained what they described as a \\"constant bearing angle\\" - keeping its prey in the centre of its field of vision. PhD student Sam Fabian explained: \\"They're not sticking to a trajectory; if the target changes direction, they compensate, so this is reactive.\\" In doing this, the insects are essentially using a very old navigation rule employed by sailors, Dr Gonzalez-Bellido explained. \\"If another vessel is not moving within your field of view, and it's getting bigger and closer, you're on a collision course,\\" she said. The team also studied the fly's eyes, revealing that part of its hunting secret was contained in its highly adapted vision. Larger lenses and a high density of extremely tiny sensors at the centre of its eyes allow it to see its prey from a distance and to accurately \\"lock on\\" as it approaches. \\"This gives this fly a resolution in this area that's the same as much larger dragonflies,\\" explained Dr Gonzalez-Bellido. \\"It's an extreme adaptation.\\" The next step for scientists is to find out exactly how Holcocephala's brain takes this visual information and turns it into a stealth hunting manoeuvre in the blink of an eye.

Foreclosure listings can be found in a variety of different places. Start by looking in the back of your local newspaper for foreclosure auctions.","completion":"Additionally, you can explore various online resources and platforms, such as websites like Zillow or Trulia, which offer information on foreclosures and pre-foreclosures in specific areas. Moreover, it may be beneficial to contact real estate agents who specialize in foreclosure properties, as they may have exclusive access to upcoming listings. Research the property's background. Before making an offer, gather as much information as possible about the property's history and current condition. Research the outstanding loan amount, possible liens, and the fair market value of comparable homes in the area. Evaluating the property's condition and location will help you make the most informed decision when negotiating the best offer. Attend open houses and viewings. Visiting the property in person is always a good idea, as pictures on a website or in a listing may not give you a full understanding of the property's condition. When attending open houses or viewings, pay attention to the building's structural integrity and note any significant repairs that may be required, such as roofing or foundation issues. Obtain pre-approval for a loan. Before you start negotiating, it is crucial that you have a pre-approval letter from a credible lender in hand. This shows the seller that you are financially capable of purchasing the property, increasing your credibility and allowing you to move quickly once you reach an agreement. Submit a competitive offer. When preparing to submit an offer, consider the property's market value, outstanding loan amount, and any necessary repairs. Prepare to provide a down payment of at least 10-20% to demonstrate your commitment and financial capability to the seller. Prepare for counteroffers and negotiations. Keep in mind that the lender or seller may not accept your initial offer. Be prepared to be flexible and responsive during negotiations, demonstrating both your willingness to compromise and your understanding of the property's realistic value. Be mindful of contingencies. When submitting an offer, you may want to include certain contingencies that protect you in case certain conditions are not met, such as a satisfactory home inspection or appraisal. However, be cautious to avoid making your offer too contingent, as this may decrease its attractiveness to the seller. Work with a real estate attorney. Hiring a real estate attorney who specializes in foreclosure properties can be beneficial throughout the negotiation process. They can help you understand the legal aspects of the transaction, draft and submit offers, and advise on potential issues that may arise. Be patient and persistent. Negotiating the best offer on a foreclosure or pre-foreclosure may take time and patience. Do not be discouraged if your initial offer is rejected, or if negotiations take longer than expected. Persistence and determination are key elements in securing the best possible deal on a distressed property. Monitor the foreclosure process. If you are interested in a pre-foreclosure property, keep a close eye on the status of the property throughout the foreclosure process. Depending on the course of the process, you may be able to submit or adjust your offer to better align with the seller's or lender's requirements. Staying up-to-date on the property's status can be critical in successfully negotiating the best deal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Process: - Bacteria enter the body - Bacteria start to divide and grow - The uncontrolled growth takes away resources from other cells - Other cells cannot function properly - We feel unwell - The growth and division of bacteria produce toxins - Toxins harm the body - The body tries to react to the toxins - The body&#x27;s natural defenses can sometimes cause us to feel unwell. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a need for ice for a drink happens, how will it affect MORE SEVERE disease occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that a change or disturbance in a system can potentially result in a more severe outcome or altered functionality of the system. In the given context, we have two separate systems: one related to bacterial infection and disease, and the other concerning the need for ice in a drink. The question is whether the perturbation of needing ice for a drink has any direct or indirect effect on the development or severity of a disease caused by bacterial infection in the body. To assess this relationship, let's first examine how the process of a bacterial infection unfolds and contributes to sickness: 1. Bacteria enter the body through various means, such as cuts, ingestion, or inhalation. 2. Once inside, bacteria begin to divide and grow, resulting in an increased number of bacterial cells. 3. The uncontrolled growth of these bacteria consumes resources that would otherwise be used by healthy cells. 4. As healthy cells are deprived of resources, they struggle to function properly, causing a decline in overall health. 5. The individual begins to feel unwell, both due to the strain on healthy cells and the effects of toxins released by the growing bacteria. 6. The body attempts to respond to the bacterial invasion and toxins by activating its natural defenses, such as the immune system, to fight off the infection. 7. In some cases, the body's response to infection may also contribute to feelings of illness or exacerbate symptoms. Now, let's consider the perturbation of needing ice for a drink and how it might relate to the above process. It is important to differentiate between needing ice merely for refreshment and using ice for therapeutic purposes. If the ice is only intended to be used in a drink for refreshment in a social setting, it is unlikely to have any direct effects on the bacterial infection and subsequent development of the disease. In this context, the need for ice remains a separate, unrelated event that does not interact with or impact the body's systems or disease progression. However, if the individual were to use ice (e.g., ice packs) for therapeutic purposes to alleviate symptoms related to the infection, there may be indirect effects on the course of the disease. For example, using ice packs can help reduce inflammation and provide temporary relief, thus allowing the body to allocate more energy and resources towards fighting the bacterial infection. However, this relief is generally short-lived and localized and would not necessarily contribute to resolving the underlying cause of the illness. In summary, the perturbation of needing ice for a drink does not have a direct effect on the development or severity of a disease caused by a bacterial infection. Under ordinary circumstances, there is no evident relationship between the two systems. However, if ice is used for therapeutic purposes, it may provide minor and temporary relief, potentially aiding the body's natural defenses somewhat. Nonetheless, the use of ice for therapeutic purposes would not significantly change the overall trajectory of the disease or its severity."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The 26-year-old Osprey plays in the same position as team captain Sam Warburton, which Gatland believes is good news for Wales. \\"We're blessed to have two world-class sevens,\\" Gatland said. Media playback is not supported on this device \\"We know what a good footballer Tipuric is when he appears in the wide channels, but sometimes it's [lacked] that physicality and competing on the ball. \\"But today he was just brilliant and he was a nuisance and just a proper seven, so we're very lucky to have the quality we've got. \\"It was probably the best performance I've seen from him in a big match in the Welsh jersey.\\" Warburton missed the match as a precaution after suffering a \\"slight\\" shoulder injury in training. Tipuric missed out on selection for the 2011 World Cup and, like the rest of the 38-man squad, faces an anxious wait until the final 31 players are named at midday on Monday, 31 August. Gatland revealed he will name 17 forwards and 14 backs, with three hookers and three scrum-halves. \\"There are 24 or 25 players nailed down but we haven't spoken about it and haven't thought about the final make-up of the squad,\\" he added. \\"The whole focus of the past few days has been about this match and not the final squad and I have no idea who the 31 is at the moment. \\"There's going to be some unlucky players who miss out, but the message to them is just keep your head down because we're not going to go through this World Cup without picking up injuries and there's a chance of being potentially called up. \\"The hardest part of the job is when you don't select someone, you leave someone out and that's not the nicest message to give out to the players.\\" Second row Alun Wyn Jones and centre Jamie Roberts were both substituted in the win over Ireland. Jones appeared to hurt a knee when he was tackled midway through the second half, while Roberts had a rib injury. However, Gatland said that as far as he knew there was nothing worse than bumps and bruises and admitted that taking Jones off 15 minutes from the end was to avert the risk of injury. \\"If it was an international that was a bit more important we probably would have left Alun Wyn Jones on until the end,\\" he said. \\"But I said it wasn't worth risking him. So I put James King on and for them to hold out without him was really pleasing.\\" However, Wales face a tough decision over whether to take prop Samson Lee, back Liam Williams and fly-half Gareth Anscombe to the World Cup. Lee and Williams have not played since last season, while Anscombe injured an ankle during Wales training. \\"We can carry one or two players but you've got to be careful how many - already injured players - you carry into the World Cup squad,\\" Gatland said. \\"Last World Cup we had a couple and we may end up the same this time.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"In this article, it talks about a rugby player named Tipuric who did a great job in a recent match.

Therefore, the answer should be related to standard household practices. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant or illogical options. - \\"internet cafe\\" is illogical because it is not a place within Sean's home. - \\"mug\\" and \\"teapot\\" are not ideal storage locations for teabags since they are typically used for immediate consumption and not long-term storage.

Take pictures One of the great things about taking pictures at an event or a party is that it gives you an excuse to get in touch with the person later. Everybody loves seeing pictures of themselves, and it's very easy after taking a picture to say \\"If you'd like I can email it to you\\". This can be the seed that leads to new connections. 2. Eat alone in public You might feel self-conscious eating by yourself but it has an important benefit: you are much easier to approach when you are alone. People may be afraid of disturbing you or being rude if you talk with someone else. Bring a book or newspaper to read. Plus, having an interesting book with you will give others an excuse tostart a conversation if they've read it. 3. Join a class, sports team, or club Yoga, salsa dancing, volleyball, Toastmasters (a public speaking club), a class for work, etc. Choose a new hobby or continue an old one! These are all great places to meet new people, primarily because you will be made to see the same people over and over again in the class. You will automatically make friends with them if you have a common interest and are made to see each other again.

Question: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land. Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands. Which parcel of land had an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers?

For kids,happiness has a magical quality.Their delight at winning a race or getting a new bike is unreserved . In the teenage years the concept of happiness changes.Suddenly it's conditional on such things as excitement,love and popularity.I can still recall the excitement of being invited to dance with the most attractive boy at the school party. In adulthood the things that bring deep joy-love,marriage,birth-also bring responsibility and the risk of loss.For adults,happiness is complicated . My definition of happiness is \\"the capacity for enjoyment\\".The more we can enjoy what we have,the happier we are.It's easy to overlook the pleasure we get from the company of friends,the freedom to live where we please,and even good health. I experienced my little moments of pleasure yesterday.First I was overjoyed when I shut the last lunchbox and had the house to myself.Then I spent an uninterrupted morning writing,which I love.When the kids and my husband came home,I enjoyed their noise after the quiet of the day. Psychologists tell us that to be happy we need a mix of enjoyable leisure time and satisfying work.I don't think that my grandmother,who raised 14 children,had much of either.She did have a network of close friends and family,and maybe this is what satisfied her. We,however,with so many choices and such pressure to succeed in every area,have turned happiness into one more thing we've got to have.We're so selfconscious about our \\"right\\" to it that it's making us miserable.So we chase it and equal it with wealth and success,without noticing that the people who have those things aren't necessarily happier. Happiness isn't about what happens to us-it's about how we see what happens to us.It's the skillful way of finding a positive for every negative.It's not wishing for what we don't have,but enjoying what we do possess.

Review: Enormous fun for both adults and children, this film works on numerous levels: there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good (yet subtle) jokes for adults. Glenn Close is at her sublimely evil best as Cruella (\`call me Ella') De Ville. After three years in Dr. Pavlov's Behaviour Modification Clinic she is cured of her desire for fur  even the puppy-skin fur she had so intensely desired. She even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits. But it wouldn't be a Dalmatian' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of Cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification. And now she needs one extra puppy (hence 102 Dalmatians) to complete her nefarious scheme this time round. Ioan Gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the \`Second Chance' dog shelter. Though he was in \`Titanic' and in last year's television version (as Pip) of \`Great Expectations' I didn't recognize him; well, he was Fifth Officer Lowe' in \`Titanic' and I didn't see \`Great Expectations' so I am not terribly surprised. Gerard Depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier-pawn of Cruella. He prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well. His 'Wicked Witch of the West' homage is hilarious. Tim McInnerny is superb is Cruella's not-so-evil henchman  he was also Alonzo,' Cruella's butler, in \`101 Dalmatians' and you may also recognize him from all of the \`Black Adder' Brit-Coms. He plays his usual bumbling, good-hearted, somewhat dim-witted character to great effect. Oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film. This is unfortunate as the clothing worn by Glenn Close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when she is being released from the Behaviour Modification Clinic) and worthy of such an over-the-top character. Her clothing alone deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Animation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans: it can't be done. Suffice it to say that \`102 Dalmatians' is even better than the film version of \`101 Dalmatians' that came out in 1996. There is a lot to like here: from the sight gags, the dialogue, and the costumes to the casting - it is a good film for the whole family. Now, what is this review like? Pick from: [A]. negative; [B]. positive;","completion":"This review is [B]. positive.

They are widely regarded as a safe means of making a phone call while behind the wheel. But researchers have today suggested that drivers using hands-free kits could pose almost as much of a safety risk as those illegally holding their mobile to their ear. A Canadian study found that drivers using hands-free devices were significantly more likely to make a host of potentially hazardous errors - from speeding to switching lanes without indicating - than drivers not talking on the phone. Not as safe as you think? Researchers in Canada say hands-free devices that allow people to talk at the wheel can still increase the risk of driver error. Sales of hands-free phone devices have. soared in the UK in recent years since it became against the law to use a. mobile phone normally while driving. The law banning drivers and motorcyclists from using hand-held phones or similar devices came into force ten years ago. The possible punishments for drivers or riders caught using their mobile range from a £60 fixed penalty and three penalty points, to being disqualified from driving and issued with a maximum fine of £1,000. The only instances in which drivers are allowed to use their phone are if they need to call 999 in an emergency and it is unsafe or impractical to stop, or if they are safely parked. Drivers are permitted to use hands-free kits, sat navs and two-way radios while driving or riding, but could still face a penalty should they be stopped by police who deem them to be distracted and not in control of their vehicle. It was thought that using a hands-free device significantly cut the risk of driver error, when compared to holding a phone to the ear. But the new study found that drivers using a hands-free phone made significantly more errors - such as crossing a centre line, speeding, or changing lanes without indicating first - compared to those not using a phone. A study led by Professor Yagesh Bhambhani, of the University of Alberta in Canada, showed the jump in errors also corresponded with a spike in heart rate and brain activity. Researchers looked at the brain activity of 26 participants who completed a driving course using a driving simulator. Participants were first tested in a. 'control' condition - using the simulator to drive through virtual city streets while using no telecommunications device. They. were then tested again while talking on a hands-free device. The drivers were engaged in two-minute conversations that avoided emotionally charged topics. Danger: Sales of hands-free kits soared after it became illegal to use a mobile phone in the usual way while behind the wheel. Researchers found there was a significant increase in brain activity while talking on a hands-free device compared with the control condition. Prof Bhambhani said: 'The findings also indicated that blood flow to the brain is significantly increased during hands-free telecommunication in order to meet the oxygen demands of the neurons under the \\"distracted\\" condition.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article is about a study in Canada that found hands-free phone devices might not be as safe as people think for drivers.

Samuel has hard time to detach from family and friends but Brett has no problem as","completion":"he was always a bit of a lone wolf. Both Samuel and Brett were in the process of moving out to a new city for college. This meant leaving behind their small hometown, the people they grew up with, and the familiar comforts that had always been there. Samuel had always been close to his family and had a tight-knit circle of friends, but he knew that pursuing higher education in this new city was an opportunity he couldn't pass up. As the days passed and the moving date grew closer, Samuel started to feel a mix of emotions - excitement towards his academic future, but also a deep sadness for leaving behind the ones he loved. Brett, on the other hand, saw this move as a chance to start anew. He had never felt truly connected to the people or place of their hometown. It always felt like he was searching for something more, a different kind of challenge or experience that could help him grow into the person he truly wanted to be. As the days went by, the anticipation of the move grew stronger in him, making him eager to step into the new chapter of his life. The day finally came for Samuel and Brett to bid their farewells and head for their new city. With teary eyes, Samuel hugged each of his family members tightly, trying to memorize the feeling of their warm embrace before he had to let go. His friends stood nearby, supportive smiles on their faces, although they too were saddened by the reality that Samuel would soon be miles apart from them. In contrast, Brett's goodbye was much more straightforward. He exchanged some quick hugs with his parents, promising to keep in touch, and gave a cool nod to the friends he was leaving behind. There was no sorrow in his eyes; only a steely determination that whispered that it was time to move on. As they settled into their new city and college life, Samuel found it challenging to adapt to the newfound independence and academic pressure. The absence of his family and friends amplified his feelings of loneliness and homesickness. He constantly kept in touch with those back home, craving their love and guidance to help him navigate his new surroundings. Brett, however, thrived in the new environment. He eagerly joined clubs and organizations, boosting his confidence and gaining new friends along the way. Various opportunities for internships and travel opened up to him, his potential now evident without the constraints of their old town. For Brett, life had changed for the better, and he embraced it wholeheartedly. Despite their vastly different responses to the challenges of their new life, Samuel and Brett remained connected through their shared history. Every now and then, they'd hang out together, discussing how things were back outside of the city and remembering memories of their past lives. Seeing the transformation in Brett, Samuel found inspiration in his friend's resilience and began to change his outlook on life. He started to embrace the opportunities that college and the new city had to offer, slowly discovering new passions and growing as an individual. By the end of their college journey, Samuel had not only built a new support system in the city but also gained enough confidence to face the world despite being distant from his family and friends. The distance had made him realize how important it was to stand on his own and follow the path he had chosen. Samuel and Brett, once tied by their shared experiences of their hometown, had ventured into a foreign world that transformed them for the better. Now, as they forged their own futures, they were no longer just the young men who had left that familiar town together - they had grown into confident adults, ready to take on the world, each pursuing their path, yet still connected through their unbreakable bond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Negative. This is deduced from the reviewer's critical and disapproving tone towards different elements of the movie. To start with, the reviewer discredits the screenwriters' portrayal of military instructors, asserting an unfavorable bias present in the characterization. They use phrases such as \\"obviously\\" and \\"anti-military types,\\" suggesting an overt negative depiction of military personnel that did not ring true to their own experiences as a Vietnam veteran. In addition, they express disappointment in the unrealistic portrayal of the private soldiers and the captain, highlighting that the depicted informal rapport \\"never happened\\" in their own time in service. The use of the word \\"never\\" further emphasizes their critical sentiment and highlights an apparent gap between portrayals in the movie and the reality of military life. Towards the end, the reviewer states they were questioning the overall point and narrative structure of the movie, indicating dissatisfaction with its thematic focus as well as its storyline. Finally, they express relief at not having paid for the film, implying that it was not worth investing in and that they derived little to no enjoyment from it. All these points taken together strongly suggest a negative sentiment.

Do these two sentences mean the same thing? Pick your answer from: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"a). no Here is the justification for my answer: Step 1: Analyze the meaning of each sentence. Sentence 1: Many democrats welcomed industrialization but were afraid of the Whigs. Sentence 2: Many democrats were afraid of an industrialization process that would be favorable to the Whigs. Step 2: Compare the meanings. While both sentences contain aspects of democrats, industrialization, and fear of the Whigs, the emphasis and cause for concern varies in each sentence. In Sentence 1, the democrats are welcoming industrialization, but they have a fear of the Whigs. The implication is that while they support industrialization, they don't want the Whigs to gain power or have influence over the process. In Sentence 2, the democrats are afraid of an industrialization process that is specifically favorable to the Whigs. They are not necessarily welcoming industrialization in general, but are specifically opposing one that benefits the Whigs. Step 3: Conclusion. Given the differences in emphasis and cause for concern in each sentence, they do not convey the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One of the main challenges in creating this bond is learning effective methods to communicate with and entice your cat to engage and interact with you. By calling your cat, offering them food or treats, and luring them with toys, you can create positive experiences to help foster a loving, long-lasting relationship with your furry friend. In this article, we will discuss the importance of building bonds with your cat and delve into the three main tactics to effectively interact with your kitty – calling their name, offering food or treats, and luring them with toys. With practice, patience, and understanding, these methods can be utilized to create fun, engaging, and affectionate encounters with your cat. The Importance of Bonding with Your Cat Cats are often known for their independent and seemingly aloof nature; however, they form deep and unique bonds with their human companions. An owner who has formed a strong connection with their feline friend will notice that their cat may seek out their company, exhibit affectionate behaviors, and display less stress and anxiety. A well-bonded cat is generally happier and healthier, which in turn facilitates a more harmonious home environment. By addressing your cat's emotional, social, and physical needs, you're not only enhancing their quality of life but also deepening the trust and connection between the two of you. 1. Calling Your Cat To effectively call your cat, start by consistently using their name during interactions, particularly when engaging in pleasurable activities such as petting or feeding. Over time, your cat will begin to associate their name with positive experiences, making it more likely for them to respond when you call. When calling your cat, use a gentle and upbeat tone, enunciating their name clearly. Remember, consistency is key – try to use the same tone and inflection each time you call them. It may also be helpful to reinforce their response with praise or a treat, creating a positive reinforcement loop that makes them more eager to come when called. 2. Attracting Your Cat with Food or Treats Using food or treats is a highly effective method for enticing your cat to come towards you. This not only makes it easier to establish interaction but also helps to create a positive association with you – something that is particularly beneficial when attempting to build a bond with a shy or nervous cat. Keep a stash of high-quality cat treats and offer them sparingly during your bonding sessions, being careful not to overfeed or upset their dietary balance. There are a variety of options available, from store-bought treats to homemade alternatives such as small pieces of cooked chicken or fish. When offering treats, be sure to use a consistent verbal or visual command to signal that you have something tasty available. Over time, your cat will begin to associate the command with being given a treat, making it easier to catch their attention and lure them towards you. 3. Luring Your Cat with Toys Toys play a significant role in developing trust and connection between you and your cat. Engaging in interactive play not only stimulates your cat mentally and physically but also serves as a platform for strengthening the bond between you both, as play helps to build trust and foster a sense of camaraderie. When selecting toys, consider your cat's interests and natural instincts. For example, cats tend to enjoy chasing and pouncing on prey-like toys, such as feather wands or toy mice. You can use these toys to lure your cat from hiding spots or coax them towards you for interaction. Remember to be patient and gradual in your approach, allowing your cat to become comfortable with the toy before attempting to use it as a lure. It is also crucial to consistently engage in play sessions to deepen the bond and maintain an enriching environment for your cat. Conclusion Forming a strong bond with your feline companion is an enriching and rewarding experience for both you and your cat. By practicing the methods of calling their name, offering food or treats, and luring them with toys, you can create enjoyable and affectionate encounters that foster trust, connection, and contentment for your furry friend. Remember, patience and consistency are crucial to establishing a meaningful bond with your cat. With time and effort, you'll soon build a strong, affectionate relationship with your feline companion, enriching your lives and making the joys of pet ownership all the more fulfilling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: conservatives to seek voters support for commandments Text:","completion":"In an ongoing political maneuver, conservatives across the country are gearing up to seek voters' support for the introduction and enforcement of a set of commandments intended to shape the legislative priorities and create a definitive course for the future of the nation. These commandments, while still under development, align fundamentally with conservative values and ideals, focusing on a broad range of social, economic, and political policies. The initiative represents a strategic move for the conservatives, a group often characterized by their commitment to traditional values, limited government interference, and free-market capitalism. With mounting societal and political challenges, conservatives believe that these commandments will provide a clear direction for the nation. They aim to bring forth this proposal to voters, in the hope that it will resonate with their values and gain their support. The exact outline of these commandments is not yet public knowledge; however, they're expected to revolve around a few central themes. First and foremost, they're anticipated to encourage personal liberty and protect individual rights. This could involve commitments to upholding freedom of speech, religion, and defending constitutional rights that conservatives view as non-negotiable. Secondly, the commandments will likely emphasize fiscal responsibility, with policies intended to reduce public debt and create a more sustainable economy. This could mean advocating for lower taxes, reduced public spending, and other measures aimed at creating a more business-friendly environment. Another focus of the commandments is expected to be on maintaining law and order, supporting a robust criminal justice system and stringent immigration policies. Within this framework, one could anticipate strengthening border security, enforcing immigration laws more rigorously, and endorsing improvements within the police and defence establishments. The defense of traditional values may also be stressed, including support for the nuclear family, opposition to abortion, and advocacy for faith-based education. These are sticking points for many conservatives, who see these issues as central to preserving the country's identity and fabric. The groundwork is being laid and it is clear that the conservative bloc sees this as an opportunity to win over voters by clarifying their stand on these pressing issues and ensure a brighter future by aligning policy decisions in the light of their long-standing principles. They are well aware of the political stakes and potential backlash, preparing to face them with resilience. While it remains to be seen how the wider electorate will respond to these commandments, conservatives believe that their robust argument and commitment to upholding their principles will convince voters to rally behind their cause. Their focus is clear - they wish to reinstate their belief in a government that is limited, fiscally responsible, upholds law and order, defends traditional values, and above all, firmly safeguards personal liberties. As the commandments come into clearer focus in the coming months, conservatives across the nation will hope that their conviction will resonate with voters, thus creating a shared vision for the future of the country, in line with their long-held conservative principles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 1: How do I calculate effective nuclear charge by slater's rule? Question 2: How do I wirelessly charge the electrical devices by piezoelectric effect? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are related to two different concepts. Let me explain each question to you separately. Question 1: How do I calculate effective nuclear charge by Slater's rule? Slater's rules are a set of empirical rules created by John C. Slater to estimate the effective nuclear charge (Z_eff) on an electron in an atom. The effective nuclear charge is a measure of the net positive charge experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom, considering electron shielding. To calculate the effective nuclear charge (Z_eff) using Slater's rules, follow these steps: 1. Identify the electron for which you want to calculate Z_eff (called the test electron) and its electron configuration. 2. Group the electrons into the following sets: - All electrons in lower-shelled orbitals (n-1, n-2, ..., 1) - Electrons in the same shell, same type of orbital as the test electron (n, l) - Electrons in the same shell, but different type of orbital as the test electron (n, l±1) 3. Assign a shielding constant \\"S\\" for each group: - For each electron in a lower shell, assign a shielding value of 0.85. - For each electron in the same shell and same type of orbital as the test electron, assign a value of 0.35. - For each electron in the same shell but different type of orbital, assign a value of 0.40 for s & p electrons, 0.35 for d electrons, and 0.30 for f electrons. 4. Calculate the total shielding S by summing up the shielding values assigned to each electron. 5. Finally, calculate the effective nuclear charge (Z_eff) by subtracting the shielding value from the atomic number (Z): Z_eff = Z - S Question 2: How do I wirelessly charge electrical devices by the piezoelectric effect? The piezoelectric effect is the process by which certain materials generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress. To wirelessly charge electrical devices using the piezoelectric effect, you can follow these general steps: 1. Choose a suitable piezoelectric material for your application, such as quartz, gallium phosphate, or a type of ceramic like lead zirconate titanate (PZT). The material should have good piezoelectric properties and be able to handle the amount of stress needed to generate a sufficient voltage. 2. Design and fabricate a piezoelectric transducer/energy harvester. This device converts mechanical stress applied to the piezoelectric material into electrical voltage. 3. Apply mechanical stress to the piezoelectric material, either by compression, bending or vibration. This could come from sources like footsteps, machinery vibrations, or even ambient noise. The applied stress will generate an electric charge in the material. 4. Connect the piezoelectric transducer to a rectifier circuit to convert the generated alternating current (AC) voltage to direct current (DC) voltage, which is suitable for charging electronic devices. 5. Use a power management circuit to regulate the output voltage to match the charging requirements of the target electrical device. 6. Finally, integrate a wireless charging transmitter (inductive or resonant) to transfer the stored energy to the target device's wireless charging receiver. The charging process can then take place wirelessly and without physical contact. Keep in mind that the feasibility and efficiency of this charging method depend on factors such as the size and properties of the piezoelectric material, the amplitude of the mechanical stress, and the specific power requirements of the device being charged."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
