Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) arrives in Rio de Janeiro, and takes a trolley driven by Orfeu (Breno Mello). New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes (Alexandro Constantino), who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina (LÃ©a Garcia). Although engaged to Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira), Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about the upcoming marriage. The couple go to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring. When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man â Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume â finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death. When Serafina's sailor boyfriend Chico (Waldemar De Souza) shows up, Orfeu offers to let Eurydice sleep in his home, while he takes the hammock outside. Eurydice invites him to her bed. Orfeu, Mira, and Serafina are the principal members of a samba school, one of many parading during Carnival. Serafina decides to have Eurydice dress in her costume so that she can spend more time with her sailor. A veil conceals Eurydice's face; only Orfeu is told of the deception. During the parade, Orfeu dances with Eurydice rather than Mira. Eventually, Mira spots Serafina among the spectators and rips off Eurydiceâs veil.

His father Tom (Van Quattro) reprimands him for being up so late and opening the door, sending him off to bed. Instead Derek watches from the stairs as his curious father opens the gift. Finding a musical orb shaped like Santa Claus in the box he activates it, causing it to strangle him with retractable cords; as Tom struggles he slips and falls onto a fireplace poker, his impaled body being found by his wife Sarah (Jane Higginson) a few moments later.Two weeks later, Sarah takes Derek, who hasn't spoken since his father's death, to a toy store owned by the elderly Joe Petto (Mickey Rooney) and his odd son Pino (Brian Bremer) not realizing they have been followed by Noah Adams (Tracy Fraim). After Derek rejects all the toys Joe shows him (and one called Larry the Larvae that Pino tries to give him) he and his mother leave, prompting Joe to begin angrily yelling at Pino, belittling him and blaming him for all the store's recent failures. While running from his father Pino bumps into Noah and drops the larvae toy, which Noah picks up and buys along with some other toys. At his home Noah begins taking apart the toys he bought from Joe when he is confronted by his angry landlord Harold (Gerry Black).

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choose your answer from: - no. - yes.","completion":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. Now, to address the issue mentioned in the questions about experiencing a period twice in one month, there could be several reasons for this occurrence: 1. Irregular cycles: Especially during puberty or perimenopause, hormonal changes can lead to irregular menstrual cycles. This might result in more frequent periods within a month or a few days apart from each other. 2. Hormonal imbalances: Sometimes, hormonal imbalances in the body can lead to irregular periods. Different hormones govern your menstrual cycle, and an imbalance in these hormones can alter your cycle's regularity. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and thyroid-related issues are some common causes of hormonal imbalances that could lead to two periods in one month. 3. Changes in birth control: If you have recently started taking, discontinued, or changed a form of birth control, your body may be adjusting to hormonal fluctuations. This might temporarily cause irregular periods. 4. Stress: High levels of stress can influence your body's hormone production and lead to irregular periods. Managing stress can help in restoring hormonal balance and promote more regular menstrual cycles. 5. Emergency contraception: If you have recently taken emergency contraception, such as the morning-after pill, it can cause changes in your cycle and potentially lead to two periods in one month. 6. Uterine polyps or fibroids: Growths in the uterus, such as polyps or fibroids, may alter your menstrual cycle and lead to irregular bleeding patterns, including more frequent periods. 7. Endometriosis: This condition occurs when the tissue lining your uterus grows outside the uterus, which can lead to painful or irregular periods. In some cases, endometriosis could cause you to have two periods in one month. 8. Infections: Certain infections, particularly of the cervix or pelvic region, might cause irregular bleeding that could be mistaken for a second period within the same month. If you consistently experience two periods within a month, it is important to consult your physician or a healthcare professional. They can accurately diagnose the cause of the irregularity and suggest appropriate treatments or management strategies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Sasha and Malia Obama commemorated their last night as residents of the White House by engaging in a very typical teenage activity: throwing a pizza and slumber party with friends! Michelle Obama revealed the inside information during a speech at the American Institute of Architecture last Thursday. During a question and answer session, the former first lady answered questions about her time at the White House, including how her daughters spent their last days at their former home. “They had a sleepover, because of course on Inauguration Day, because my girls are so normal, they’re like, ‘Well, eight girls are gonna be sleeping here because it’s our last time, and we want pizza, and we want nuggets.’ And it’s like, really?” she told the audience. She also shared that Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, found it difficult to leave the only home they had known for the last eight years. “So that moment of transition, right before the doors opened and we welcomed in the new family, our kids were leaving out the back door in tears, saying goodbye to people,” she said. RELATED: Michelle Obama made one actress’ year by writing her a letter of recommendation Mrs. Obama added that she did try to keep her composure, though, because she knew any tears that she shed would be misconstrued. “I didn’t want to have tears in my eyes because people would swear I was crying because of the new president,” she quipped. Obama shared a small insight into her post-White House life with the audience, saying, “Friends are surprised I answer the door now.” She also reiterated that she has no interest in running for office. “I wouldn’t ask my children to do this again,” she said. RELATED: Michelle Obama told Ellen she’s “proud” of how Malia and Sasha have handled their time at the White House ||||| RISING STAR The Making of Barack Obama By David J. Garrow 1,460 pages. William Morrow. 45. “Rising Star,” the voluminous 1,460-page biography of Barack Obama by David J. Garrow, is a dreary slog of a read: a bloated, tedious and — given its highly intemperate epilogue — ill-considered book that is in desperate need of editing, and way more exhausting than exhaustive. Many of the more revealing moments in this volume will be familiar to readers of Obama’s own memoir, “Dreams From My Father”; a host of earlier books about Obama and his family; and myriad profiles of the former president that have appeared in newspapers and magazines over the years. Garrow has turned up little that’s substantially new — save for identifying and interviewing an old girlfriend from Obama’s early Chicago years, who claims that by 1987, “he already had his sights on becoming president.” In the absence of thoughtful analysis or a powerful narrative through line, Garrow’s book settles for barraging the reader with a cascade of details — seemingly in hopes of creating a kind of pointillist picture. The problem is that all these data points never connect to form an illuminating portrait; the book does not open out to become the sort of resonant narrative that Robert A. Caro and Ron Chernow have pioneered, in which momentous historical events are deftly recreated, and a subject’s life is situated in a time and a place. Instead, Garrow has expended a huge amount of energy — his bibliography, including interviews with more than a thousand people, runs to 35 pages — on giving us minutely detailed accounts of early chapters of Obama’s life, like his years at Harvard Law School, his time in Chicago as a community organizer, and his work in the Illinois State Senate. Garrow gets to Obama’s presidency only in an epilogue. Image Barack Obama as a Harvard student in 1990. Credit Joe Wrinn/Harvard University, via Associated Press While the Chicago chapter sheds valuable light on Obama’s connection with black residents and his developing sense of vocation, many of the other sections that try to chronicle his day-to-day life feel extraneous and absurdly long-winded, as if Garrow wanted to include every last scrap of information he’d unearthed. Are we really interested in what numerous Obama classmates, colleagues and passing acquaintances remember about his personality — that he struck them as cool or friendly, arrogant or voluble, cheerful or detached? Do we really want to read repetitious discussions about his cigarette consumption and poker-playing habits? |||||","completion":"Sasha and Malia Obama, the daughters of former US president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, marked their final days in the White House by holding a pizza and slumber party, according to their mother.

Given the question: Given the following passage \\"Four boarders at his parents' apartments became Chopin's intimates: Tytus Woyciechowski, Jan Nepomucen Białobłocki, Jan Matuszyński and Julian Fontana; the latter two would become part of his Paris milieu. He was friendly with members of Warsaw's young artistic and intellectual world, including Fontana, Józef Bohdan Zaleski and Stefan Witwicki. He was also attracted to the singing student Konstancja Gładkowska. In letters to Woyciechowski, he indicated which of his works, and even which of their passages, were influenced by his fascination with her; his letter of 15 May 1830 revealed that the slow movement (Larghetto) of his Piano Concerto No. 1 (in E minor) was secretly dedicated to her – \\"It should be like dreaming in beautiful springtime – by moonlight.\\" His final Conservatory report (July 1829) read: \\"Chopin F., third-year student, exceptional talent, musical genius.\\"\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: How did she influence him? The answer is:","completion":"The student Konstancja Gładkowska influenced Chopin, or Frederic Chopin - the noted Polish composer and piano virtuoso - predominantly in his creative output of music. According to the passage, it is apparent that Chopin was significantly moved by Gładkowska's singing talent which fuelled his imagination and shaped his artistic creation. This is evident when in letters to his close associate, Tytus Woyciechowski, Chopin acknowledged that certain portions of his works were inspired by his fascination for Gładkowska. One explicit instance mentioned in the text is the slow movement (Larghetto) of his Piano Concerto No. 1 (in E minor) which was secretly dedicated to her. In a letter dated 15 May 1830, Chopin described his emotional state while composing the piece as being similar to 'dreaming in beautiful springtime – by moonlight.' This suggests that his feelings for Gładkowska influenced the mood and emotional depth of his music, contributing to the dream-like and romantically serene character of the composition. This shows Gładkowska's tangible influence on his creativity. Therefore, it can be inferred from the text that Gładkowska's effect on Chopin was profoundly psychological and emotional. Her presence and talent inspired Chopin, instigating him to produce pieces of music that echoed his internal emotions associated with her. This intrinsically demonstrates how she marked a significant influence on him. She served as a muse that sparked creativity in Chopin, culminating in him composing beautiful pieces of music that encapsulated his emotions for her, lending them a sense of genuine and profound depth. This observation ultimately underscores her extensive impact on his artistic creations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Write a \\"negative\\" movie review (Options are: * negative. * positive.).","completion":"Title: A Cinematic Calamity - \\"The Lost Cause\\" If movies were an investment, \\"The Lost Cause\\" would send its investors to the depths of bankruptcy. The film initially promised to bring a fresh perspective to the stale realm of cliche-ridden blockbusters, but instead, it drowned in its own sea of ineptitude. From the very first frame, the audience is subjected to a cacophony of dreadful acting, abysmal dialogue, and an unfathomable plot that gives the impression of being created by a malfunctioning slot machine. The movie's convoluted narrative revolves around the protagonist, Jack Exemplar, played by an excruciatingly wooden John Fauxtalent. The character seems to be a random hodgepodge of classic action heroes, without any of the charm that made them unforgettable. While Jack goes on an epic quest to uncover a long-lost treasure – a narrative format that was surely stolen from the classics – the film manages to make even this age-old formula insufferable. The countless clichés that clutter the movie feel as though they were meticulously collected from the waste bins of better films before being repurposed for this catastrophe. As we follow Jack on his forced odyssey, we are introduced to an assortment of characters designed to break the mold but instead, end up shattering all patience. From the cunning-yet-stereotypical femme fatale played by Bella Stereotype to the comic relief sidekick played by Tom Unfunnybone, the actors appear to have graduated from a school of acting where subtlety and range were optional subjects. Helming this disaster is the criminally overconfident director, Alan Egotrip, who seems singularly focused on elevating the film's artificial nature. It is evident that the director struggled throughout to make a coherent vision of this movie, resulting in a final product that feels like a botched Frankenstein monster. Instead of exploring the material and portraying a genuine artistic origin, Egotrip indulges in an obscene number of random slow-motion sequences and deliberately prolonged extreme close-ups that serve no purpose whatsoever. Amid the unsatisfactory performances and lackluster direction, the film's writing is its most outstanding flaw. The script is a veritable minefield of contrived situations, wooden dialogue, and ludicrous character motivations. Watching the film, one must wonder if the screenwriter's computer had a vendetta against originality – an unseen digital saboteur hell-bent on creating the most incoherent screenplay imaginable. The special effects and production design are equally disappointing. Rather than utilizing the unlimited visual possibilities of the film medium, the CGI and set pieces are seemingly borrowed from the worst online tutorials available. The color palette is an eyesore, and the feeble attempt at realism leaves the viewer questioning the sanity of the film's art department. In conclusion, \\"The Lost Cause\\" is a perfect storm of terrible acting, abominable writing, and unfortunate direction. The audience, who must endure this descent into cinematic depravity, is left wondering how such a calamity managed to find funding and a place on the silver screen. It is a production that signals dark days ahead for movies, as if a dire warning of dreadful cinematic experiences to come. This is a film best left to gather dust in a forgotten corner of the entertainment world, a shameful relic of Hollywood's lowest moments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors. Would darker squirrels have greater or smaller chance of survival than lighter squirrels? Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. A:","completion":"Mike's observation of squirrels having different coat colors in his cold mid-western city can be explained through the process of natural selection. Natural selection is the primary driving force for the evolution of species, as it favors the survival of individuals with traits that are suited to their environment. In this case, we can evaluate the survival chances of darker squirrels compared to lighter squirrels by considering various factors such as predation, thermoregulation, and camouflage. In a cold environment, darker coats might provide the squirrels with an advantage in thermoregulation. Dark colors absorb more solar radiation, which helps the animal retain heat better in colder climates. This effect might contribute to the increased survival rate of darker squirrels in freezing conditions. Darker-furred squirrels could benefit from this since heat retention is an essential factor for maintaining body temperature and sustaining energy levels necessary for survival. However, coat color also plays a significant role in providing camouflage to squirrels, helping them hide from predators. In a snowy environment, the lighter squirrels would potentially have an advantage in blending in with the white backdrop, making it harder for predators to detect them. This could favor the lighter squirrels' survival in areas with heavy snow and increased predator-prey interactions during winter months. As Mike mentioned, there is not much predator-prey interaction in his city. In this context, the importance of camouflage to escape predators diminishes, and the thermoregulation provided by the darker coat could have a more substantial impact on squirrels' survival. Consequently, the darker squirrels would likely have a greater chance of survival in this specific area. However, various factors could affect the development of squirrels' coat color, such as genetic variations within the squirrel population. Further investigation and observation are necessary to determine whether these coat colors result from natural selection or genetic mutation. Ultimately, it is essential to consider the multiple factors at play when examining the survival chances of squirrels with different coat colors, as it is a complex and multifaceted question. In conclusion, in Mike's cold mid-western city, where there is less predator-prey interaction, darker squirrels may have a greater chance of survival due to their enhanced ability to thermoregulate and maintain body heat in freezing conditions. However, other factors such as genetic variation and predator population dynamics could also affect these squirrels' survival, making it a multifaceted and exciting topic to explore."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Paragraph: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government. Question: \\"What development in fire technology did Marco Polo discover when he reached the capital of China?\\" Answer: \\"Black stones dug out of mountains\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. When Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he discovered that the Chinese used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. These black stones refer to coal, which was an advanced development in fire technology at that time compared to what Europeans were using."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: If I tell you that A cavern is formed by carbon dioxide is in groundwater seeping through rock and dissolving limestone, and ask you the question \\"what forms caverns by seeping through rock and dissolving limestone?\\", is the correct answer \\"pure oxygen\\"? Pick your answer from: a). Yes. b). No. Answer:","completion":"b). No. Caverns are not formed by pure oxygen. In the scenario you provided, a cavern is formed by carbon dioxide in groundwater seeping through rock and dissolving limestone. A detailed explanation of cavern formation in this case can be found below. The mechanism underlying the formation of caverns is the chemical process of dissolution. When slightly acidic rainwater, containing dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2), infiltrates the ground, it enters the soil and percolates downwards, further dissolving more CO2. This is because the groundwater combines with additional CO2 from decaying plant matter and respiration from organisms, resulting in a weak carbonic acid solution (H2CO3). When this acidic groundwater reaches the bedrock made of limestone (a calcium carbonate, or CaCO3-rich rock), a slow chemical reaction takes place. The carbonic acid reacts with the calcium carbonate in the limestone to form calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2). This newly formed calcium bicarbonate is soluble in water, thus dissolving the limestone and causing it to be carried away by the groundwater. Over an extended period, the repetitive process of dissolution enlarges the existing subterranean channels and fissures in the limestone, eventually leading to the formation of caves or caverns. In summary, the correct answer to the question, \\"what forms caverns by seeping through rock and dissolving limestone?\\" is carbon dioxide in groundwater, and not pure oxygen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose father died in 1819? from the following article ? Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti).

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"To analyze the linguistic integrity of the given sentence, I will perform a step-by-step evaluation. Step 1: Identify the sentence structure. The sentence appears to be structured as \\"Subject + Verb + Object.\\" Here, \\"John\\" is the subject, \\"placed\\" is the verb, and \\"him busy\\" is the object. Step 2: Analyze the subject. \\"John\\" functions as a proper noun and is an acceptable subject. Step 3: Analyze the verb. \\"Placed\\" is a transitive verb, which means it requires a direct object to make sense. Based on the sentence structure, \\"him busy\\" should function as the direct object. Step 4: Analyze the object. \\"Him\\" is an object pronoun, which works as an object in a sentence. However, the use of the adjective \\"busy\\" following \\"him\\" is an issue and appears to be an error. Step 5: Consider possible corrections. A grammatically correct version of the sentence might be either \\"John kept him busy\\" or \\"John placed him in a busy state.\\" In these examples, the verb \\"kept\\" is more suitable for describing an influence on someone's state of busyness, while \\"placed him in a busy state\\" would use the original verb \\"placed\\" with the correct object phrase. Step 6: Determine linguistic integrity. The linguistic integrity of the original sentence is low, as it contains errors in the object section of the sentence, making it hard to understand its intended meaning. With corrections like those suggested above, the linguistic integrity can be improved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given those answer options, answer the question: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Objective: ice Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"Before I begin, I must clarify that there is no mention of specific solutions in your question; hence, I will assume you are asking about the general concept of naïve physics reasoning and its soundness in different solution types. I will then discuss and compare problem-solving methods that may better align with naïve physics reasoning. Naïve physics is an aspect of human cognition, proposing that humans have an intuitive and often unconscious understanding of the world's physics. This understanding governs how we predict and react to everyday physical objects and their behaviors, including elements like water and ice. There are several types of problem-solving approaches. Some major distinctions include: 1. Analytical Approach: In this approach, problems are solved through logic, analysis, and critical thinking. This method heavily relies on a step-by-step thought process, scientific knowledge, and the application of principles and theories. While this approach may provide more scientifically accurate and sound solutions, it's not necessarily aligned with naïve physics reasoning, as it does not rely on intuitive pre-existing knowledge. 2. Heuristic Approach: This approach is characterized by trial and error, using shortcuts or rules of thumb to find solutions quickly. Heuristics may lead to inaccurate and scientifically unsound solutions. However, they reflect the naïve physics reasoning better because heuristics are based on the intuitive understanding of our physical environment. 3. Expert Intuition: Expert intuition is a type of decision-making that comes from extensive experience in a specific field. While it seems spontaneous, only an expert can achieve such a level of decision-making. Due to in-depth knowledge and experience in a subject, experts can often make decisions that are based on sound reasoning without being explicitly analytical. In terms of naïve physics reasoning, an ideal solution type should align with human intuition and experience while providing a scientifically sound solution. The heuristic approach seems to align better with naïve physics reasoning directly, as it relies on intuition and common sense. However, it may sometimes lead to incorrect conclusions. A more sound approach in terms of naïve physics reasoning might be combining expert intuition with an analytical approach. By doing this, an expert can provide a solution that is both scientifically sound and based on experience. The expert can also correct any inconsistencies with the naïve physics reasoning by applying their analytical abilities. In summary, while the heuristic approach aligns well with naïve physics reasoning, it might not always provide sound solutions. Combining expert intuition with an analytical approach can lead to more sound solutions in terms of naïve physics reasoning, as it combines the strengths of both methods. This combined approach allows experts to rely on their extensive experience while ensuring that their solutions are scientifically sound and align with the principles of naïve physics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is most probably the case regarding why Trump did not make payment to the adult star directly?","completion":"Based on the given context, it is not explicitly mentioned why Trump did not make the payment to the adult star directly. However, it can be inferred that he reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who then paid the adult film star. The president reimbursed Cohen to stop \\"false and extortionist accusations\\" about the alleged tryst. This arrangement might have been an attempt to maintain a level of separation or confidentiality regarding the payment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Originally setting his sights on the Indianapolis 500, Cole realizes that \\"To win in Indy I'd need a great car, but stock cars are all the same\\". He is recruited by Chevrolet dealership tycoon Tim Daland to race for his team in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series. Daland brings former crew chief and car builder Harry Hogge out of retirement to lead Cole's pit crew. After Cole sets a fast time in a private test at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Hogge builds him a new Chevrolet Lumina. In his first few races, Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew, while being intimidated on the track by Winston Cup Champion and dirty driver Rowdy Burns; these obstacles, combined with crashes and blown engines, prevent Cole from finishing the races. Discovering that Cole does not understand common NASCAR terminology, Harry puts him through rigorous training. This pays off at the Darlington race, when Cole uses a slingshot maneuver from the outside line to overtake Rowdy and win his first race. The rivalry between Cole and Rowdy intensifies throughout the season until the Firecracker 400 in Daytona, where both drivers are seriously injured after being caught in \\"The Big One\\". Recovering in Daytona Beach, Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr. Claire Lewicki, a neurosurgeon at Halifax Hospital.

Step 2: Relate the increased glucagon to the usage of insulin - If more glucagon happens, it means the body breaks down more stored glucose into the bloodstream rather than storing it.

This indicates that the reviewer found other similar products more informative and valuable, adding another negative aspect to the review. 5.

While Stafford was still working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, \\"Some day I'm going to have my own record company, and you're going to record for me.\\" She subsequently became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played.

They plan to head \\"towards those for whom I have UNloving memories.\\"First stop is Regalberg where they revive Dracula [John Carradine], in the guise of Baron Latoes from Transylvania, who kills the Burgermeister who originally put Neimann in jail.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Only a trained, qualified medical professional should attempt to transport a bedridden person. Do not attempt to do this at home or in a medical setting if you are not trained and qualified to do so. Before you start moving the person, you need to make sure they are aware of what you're doing. Tell them exactly what you're going to do and why (they need to be transported) before you start the process of transporting them. In addition, talk to them as you perform each step so they know what to expect. If the person is able to sit in wheelchairs for short periods, you may be able to transport them yourself. To begin, make sure the wheelchair is next to the bed with the seat facing you. The side of the wheelchair should be close to the bed. The wheelchair needs to be stable and ready for the person to sit. Set the brakes so that the wheelchair doesn't move around. Pull the footrests up towards the wheels so that the person has a clear path to the seat. When trying to move someone, you also need to protect yourself, particularly your back and legs. Make sure you keep your legs shoulder-width apart with your knees bent. Also, don't bend at the waist. Rather, keep your spine in a natural position. Keep in mind that it can take some strength to move someone. Have someone assist you if you're not sure you can do it by yourself. If the person can't sit up themselves, you'll need to help lift them to sitting. Place an arm behind their back. Place your other arm under their knees, looping it in so you can pull them towards you. Turn the person's lower body towards the edge of the bed while simultaneously lifting from the top. You should end up with the person sitting up with their feet on the floor. Let the person sit for a moment, as the process can make them dizzy. Place your legs around the patient's outside leg (the one not near the wheelchair). Keeping your back straight, bend at the knees. Grasp the patient by placing your arms under theirs, going around the chest. Grasp your own hands in the back. Lift the patient up. if needed. If the person cannot support their weight at all, you should use a Hoyer lift to transport them. Start by placing the sling under the person by rolling them to one side and positioning it under them. Adjust the leg loops around the thighs, crossing them underneath for security. Move the lift into place. The legs position under the bed, while the top of the lift (the cradle) moves over the bed to attach to the sling. Push the lift in as far as it will go. Do not lock the brakes. Attach both sides of the sling to the appropriate sides of the cradle. Once the sling is attached, lift the person up slowly until they are just above the mattress. Swing their legs out towards the lift to clear the edge. Gently move the person away from the mattress, lowering the bed if you need to do so. Turn the person towards the seat. The patient should try to provide as much support as they can with their legs. Lower them gently when they're legs hit the edge of the seat. Tell them to grab the arms of the wheelchair to help if they can. A gait belt can give you something to grasp. You put it around the patient's waist and then use it to help lift them. If you're using a Hoyer lift, position the person over the wheelchair using the lift. Gently lower them into the wheelchair. A van with a wheelchair lift will work best. However, in a car, you can do a similar transfer as you did to the bed. Lift the person, in the same way, setting them down on the seat of the car. Place one arm behind their back and one arm under their legs to pivot them into the car. Help them buckle in.

Rookie cornerback Jason Verrett intercepted Oakland Raiders rookie quarterback Derek Carr at the San Diego 5 with 1:13 remaining in the game to seal a 31-28 Chargers win on the road. San Diego had gone ahead with 1:56 to play on a 1-yard touchdown run by Oliver. Verrett's first career interception helped the Chargers extend their winning streak to five, while Oakland suffered its 11th straight defeat. The Chargers 5-1 start to begin the season was their best since 2002. Carr threw a 77-yard TD pass to Andre Holmes in the opening minute of the game, and he and Rivers both threw two touchdowns in the first half for a 14-14 tie at halftime. In the third quarter, a 54-yard Novak field goal was nullified by a Chargers holding penalty. On fourth-and-35, Weddle threw an incomplete pass on a fake punt, giving the Raiders excellent field position; Oakland then scored on a 47-yard TD pass from Carr to Brice Butler. The Chargers responded with a Gates score on a 1-yard pass from Rivers, and the game was tied at 21 to begin the fourth quarter. Oakland took the lead again after Carr found Holmes for a 6-yard TD with 10 minutes left. On the following possession, Rivers completed the first four passes for 70 yards, which led to a 30-yard field goal by Novak. The Chargers defense forced a three-and-out, when Allen&#8212;filling in for an injured Royal&#8212;returned the punt 29 yards to the Oakland 39. With 4:49 remaining, Rivers led the six-play game-winning TD drive which culminated with four straight runs by Oliver for 29 yards. The Raiders had the ball on the Chargers 45 on second-and-one, when Carr threw deep for Butler, but Verrett leaped for an acrobatic sideline interception. Verrett had left the game earlier in the third quarter after tearing his left labrum in three places while diving for a pass. Oliver ran for 101 yards in the game, and Rivers threw for 313 yards and three touchdowns. For Rivers, it was an NFL-record fifth straight game with at least a 120 passer rating.

Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: What prevents a couple from going to bed? Options: - insomnia - pregnancy - making love - rest - infant Answer:","completion":"The option in line with common sense that would prevent a couple from going to bed is insomnia. Insomnia is a sleep disorder that makes it difficult for a person to fall and stay asleep or to feel well-rested after waking up. This condition can affect one or both individuals in the couple, causing them to struggle with settling down for rest at night. Insomnia can arise from various factors including stress, anxiety, medical conditions, or even poor habits that interfere with their sleep-wake cycle. Due to this, the couple might find it challenging to establish a regular sleep schedule and synchronize their bedtime routines. Consequently, this sleep disorder interferes with their ability to easily transition from their daily activities to bedtime. While pregnancy, making love, rest, and infants can also impact a couple's bedtime routine in various ways, these options do not necessarily limit the couple's ability to go to bed. For instance: - Pregnancy: Although it might introduce physical discomfort and sleep disturbances for expectant mothers, it generally does not prevent a couple from going to bed. - Making love: This intimate activity often relaxes and strengthens the emotional bond between partners, potentially promoting a restful night's sleep. However, there might be cases where it could interfere with the couple's intention to sleep. - Rest: This option wouldn't hinder a couple from going to bed, as it is suggestive of relaxation and recuperation, which aligns with the purpose of sleep. - Infant: The presence of a newborn might affect the couple's sleep schedule due to nighttime feedings or disturbances, yet it doesn't prevent them from attempting to go to bed. Instead, they might need to adjust their routines and expectations surrounding sleep. In summary, insomnia is the most logical option that prevents a couple from going to bed, as it directly affects their ability to fall asleep and stay asleep, impacting their overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's how you do it: Ex. 1: 3√(2) x √(10) = 3√(2 x 10) = 3√(20) Ex. 2: 4√(3) x 3√(6) = 12√(3 x 6) = 12√(18) Next, simplify the numbers under the radicals by looking for perfect squares or multiples of the numbers under the radicals that are perfect squares. Once you've simplified those terms, just multiply them by their corresponding coefficients. Here's how you do it: 3√(20) = 3√(4 x 5) = 3√([2 x 2] x 5) = (3 x 2)√(5) = 6√(5) 12√(18) = 12√(9 x 2) = 12√(3 x 3 x 2) = (12 x 3)√(2) = 36√(2) What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article explains the process of multiplying and simplifying expressions involving radical terms.

Living things need non-living matter as well as energy. What do you think matter is used for? One thing is to build bodies. They also need it to carry out the processes of life. Any non-living matter that living things need is called a nutrient. Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. You can see how in Figure 3.11. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms. The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots. The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants. The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers. When living things die, the cycle repeats.

Step 3: Analyze the options provided Now we need to determine which among the given options is the source that promotes the creation of serotonin through ultraviolet light: (1) Jupiter: Jupiter is a planet and does not emit sunlight, so it cannot be responsible for creating serotonin. (2) Venus: Similar to Jupiter, Venus is a planet and is not a source of sunlight or ultraviolet light, so it cannot stimulate serotonin production. (3) The Sun: The Sun is the primary source of sunlight and ultraviolet light. The exposure to its light is what stimulates serotonin production in the human body. (4) The Moon: The Moon does not produce sunlight, but it reflects sunlight from the Sun.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple. Documents show weavers in Wervik paid taxes to Catherine Rapondi and in September 1434, when Michele Burlamacchi was tax collector in that town, van Eyck received a stipend funded...

From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, one of the Achaemenid capitals, and captured its legendary treasury. He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He had to storm the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury. On entering Persepolis, Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days. Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months. During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of Xerxes and spread to the rest of the city. Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Persian War.

If I tell you that Speciation occurs by a process called natural selection, and ask you the question \\"what occurs by a process called natural selection?\\", is the correct answer \\"competition\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"what occurs by a process called natural selection?\\" is not \\"competition.\\" Although competition plays a role in natural selection, it is not the main outcome or process being described by this term. Natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution that refers to the process by which organisms with heritable traits that are advantageous for their survival and reproduction in a given environment are more likely to pass those traits on to their offspring. In natural selection, organisms with favorable traits have a higher chance of survival and are more likely to reproduce, thus passing on their beneficial traits to future generations. As a result, the frequency of these advantageous traits becomes more common within a population over successive generations. This process helps explain how species adapt to changing environments and ultimately leads to the formation of new species, known as speciation. While competition can influence natural selection (e.g., through competition for limited resources, mates, or territory), it is only one component. Other factors, such as predation, environmental changes, and genetic mutations, also play critical roles in the process of natural selection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Among them is W.P. Inman (Jude Law), a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada (Nicole Kidman), a minister's daughter, and finds their whirlwind courtship interrupted by the American Civil War. Three years later, Inman finds himself in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, during the Battle of the Crater. Union soldiers tunneling beneath Confederate fortifications detonate over 300 kegs of gunpowder, in a futile attempt to undermine the position prior to their assault. As the ill-fated attack begins, Oakley (Lucas Black) an old acquaintance of Inman's from Cold Mountain, is impaled on a bayonet and mortally wounded. Inman rescues him from the fighting and takes him to a field hospital. Later that day Oakley dies in the hospital, with Inman and Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson) beside him. The next night, Inman, along with his Cherokee friend Swimmer (Jay Tavare), are sent to flush out surviving Union troops trapped behind their lines. During the raid, a burst of friendly fire kills Swimmer and seriously injures Inman. As Inman lies in the hospital near death, he has a letter from Ada read to him in which she pleads with him to stop fighting, stop marching, and come back to her. Inman recovers, andâwith the war drawing ever closer to an inevitable Confederate defeatâdecides to go home to Cold Mountain. On his journey he meets the corrupt preacher Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who is about to drown his pregnant slave lover. Inman stops Veasey, and leaves him tied up to face the town's justice. Exiled from his parish, Veasey later rejoins Inman on his journey. They help a young man named...

I doubt that I will ever go back there . So we went up to The Cafe in the north part of Ames . ( picture blow ) The Cafe is one of the nicest places in Ames to eat . Why will I never go back to that restaurant .","completion":"Based on your experience, there are several reasons why you may never go back to that restaurant: 1. Poor hygiene: You mentioned that the table was dirty upon arrival. This reflects on the overall cleanliness of the establishment, and it signals that the management may not prioritize proper sanitation and hygiene. Since cleanliness in a restaurant is essential, especially concerning food safety, it is understandable that this aspect alone would discourage you from returning. 2. Inefficient service: The fact that other guests who arrived after you were greeted and instructed on how to order, while you were not, shows that there might be inconsistencies and inefficiency in the service provided. Patrons expect to be treated fairly and to receive timely attention from the staff at a restaurant, and being overlooked leads to dissatisfaction. 3. Limited menu options: It seems that when you finally decided on an item to order, the restaurant had run out of what you wanted. Running out of menu options can be indicative of poor planning on the management’s part or a limited supply of ingredients. It also leads to frustration for customers who are denied their desired dish. 4. Inattentiveness to guests' needs: From your experience, it appears that the staff did not go above and beyond to cater to your needs when you told them the table was dirty. Good customer service is dependent on showing attentiveness to guests' concerns, and you may feel that the restaurant failed to demonstrate this. 5. Negative first impression: In the hospitality industry, it is often said that first impressions are crucial. Since your experience was characterized by various negative aspects, such as uncleanliness, inefficient service, and limited options, you may doubt the restaurant's ability to not only improve but also provide you with a satisfactory dining experience in the future. 6. Better options available: You mentioned finding a different restaurant, The Cafe in the north part of Ames, which you described as one of the nicest places to eat in the area. When there are better establishments available that provide a high-quality dining experience, it is natural that you would prefer to go there instead of returning to a restaurant with a negative track record. In conclusion, the combination of these factors has significantly impacted your decision and created a reluctance to return to that particular restaurant. It is essential for businesses, especially in the competitive food industry, to prioritize cleanliness, customer service, and menu availability to retain customers and generate positive feedback. The lack of these attributes in the restaurant you visited has led to your decision to not return and search for better alternatives like The Cafe in the north part of Ames."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write a text based on \\"beijing residents keep cool headed on consumption\\" Text:","completion":"Title: \\"Beijing Residents Maintain Levelheaded Approach to Consumption: A Blend of Tradition and Sustainability\\" Introduction: In recent years, Beijing has experienced rapid urbanization and economic growth, which in turn has led to increased consumption among citizens. Surprisingly, its residents have managed to adopt a level-headed approach to consumerism, skillfully blending traditional Chinese values with modern sustainability practices. This has helped in mitigating the adverse environmental and socio-economic impacts brought about by excessive or impulsive consumption. The Roots of a Mindful Consumption in Beijing: The philosophy of frugality and sustainable living runs deep in Chinese culture. The teachings of ancient Chinese philosophers, such as Confucius and Lao Tzu, emphasize the importance of balance and moderation in all aspects of life. These time-tested principles have been passed down through generations, and are still evident in the daily lives of Beijing residents. Beijing's residents have etched these values in their consumption patterns. They are known to prioritize practicality, longevity, and functionality of products over extravagance or unnecessary extravagance. This attitude comfortably fits in with the current global trend of promoting mindful consumerism to combat the environmental challenges posed by overconsumption. Adapting Old Values to Modern Lifestyles: In contemporary Beijing, residents continue to uphold traditional values and apply them to a rapidly changing society. Here are some examples of how they have successfully integrated time-honored principles with modern living standards: 1. Utilizing public transportation: Beijing residents are avid users of public transport, including the extensive subway and bus systems. This reduces the need for personal transportation, resulting in fewer resources used and a decline in pollution. It is in line with the ancient Chinese belief in living in harmony with the environment. 2. Food and cooking: Beijing locals embrace family recipes that have been passed down through generations. The Chinese ethos of using every part of an ingredient to minimize waste aligns well with modern sustainability practices. Moreover, Beijing citizens are known to carefully plan their meals and grocery shopping, ensuring that they do not overbuy or let food go to waste, hence, reducing their carbon footprint. 3. Repair and reuse: Rather than discarding damaged items, Beijing residents are more inclined to repair and restore them to their original condition, prolonging their lifespan. This approach is rooted in the traditional Chinese belief that favors resourcefulness and creativity to work around challenges and scarcity. 4. Supporting local businesses and artisans: Beijing residents are proud of their age-old handicrafts and traditional products, which symbolize the rich cultural history of China. They prefer to purchase goods from local artisans or small businesses, not just to support the traditional ways of production but also to strengthen the local economy while maintaining a sustainable consumption pattern. The Role of the Beijing Government in Supporting Mindful Consumption: The local government in Beijing plays an essential role in promoting and sustaining a level-headed approach to consumption. They have implemented eco-friendly policies, such as encouraging sustainable architecture, promoting recycling, and offering incentives for businesses that adopt green practices. Moreover, the government is investing in urban planning and public transportation to maintain a city infrastructure that supports sustainable living, allowing residents to make responsible consumption choices more easily. Conclusion: Beijing has provided a unique example of how a traditional mindset and values can be adapted to modern life. The residents of this vibrant city have successfully combined ancient wisdom with contemporary sustainability practices, setting an example for cities worldwide. It is a testament to the flexibility and resilience of both the people and their culture, and proof that ancient philosophies still have a vital role to play in addressing contemporary issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mae Carol Jemison was born in Decatur, Alabama, on October 17, 1956, the youngest child of Charlie Jemison and Dorothy Green. Her father was a maintenance supervisor for a charity organization, and her mother worked most of her career as an elementary school teacher of English and math at the Beethoven School in Chicago. The family moved to Chicago, Illinois, when Jemison was three years old, to take advantage of the better educational and employment opportunities there. Jemison says that as a young girl growing up in Chicago she always assumed she would get into space. In the spring of 1996, Jemison filed a complaint against a Texas police officer, accusing him of police brutality during a traffic stop that ended in her arrest. She was pulled over by Nassau Bay, Texas officer Henry Hughes for allegedly making an illegal U-turn and arrested after Hughes learned of an outstanding warrant on Jemison for a speeding ticket. In the process of arresting her, the officer twisted her wrist and forced her to the ground. In her complaint, Jemison said the officer physically and emotionally mistreated her. Jemison's attorney said she believed she'd already paid the speeding ticket years ago. She spent several hours in jail and was treated at an area hospital after release for deep bruises and a head injury. Jemison said in a televised interview that the incident has altered her feelings about police there. \\"I always felt safe and comfortable [around the police]. I don't feel that way anymore at Nassau Bay and that's a shame,\\" she said. Jemison filed a lawsuit against the city of Nassau Bay and officer Hughes. In 2007, diagnostic test provider Gen-Probe Inc. announced that they would not accept the resignation of Jemison from their board of directors. Jemison had failed to be re-elected to the board in a vote of the shareholders of the company at the company's May 31 annual stockholders meeting. The company said it believed that Jemison's failed re-election was the result of a recommendation by advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services that shareholders vote against her due to her poor attendance at board meetings. Gen-Probe determined that Jemison's two absences in 2006 were for valid reasons and said Jemison had attended all regular and special board and committee meetings since September.

Article:House of Representatives Majority Whip Steve Scalise was one of five injured in the early morning ambush at a park in Alexandria, Virginia. The attacker, identified as Illinois native James T Hodgkinson, 66, was killed after a firefight with police. The injured included two officers with non-life-threatening wounds. Hodgkinson was self-employed until recently and worked as a home inspector. He had campaigned for former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. A Facebook account that appears to belong to Hodgkinson is filled with anti-Republican and anti-Trump posts. Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator, said he was \\"sickened by this despicable act\\" and condemned Hodgkinson's actions. President Trump described the attack as a \\"very, very brutal assault\\". \\"We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation's capital is here because, above all, they love our country,\\" he added. The president visited Mr Scalise - who was shot in the left hip and is in a critical condition after surgery - at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Wednesday evening, describing him as a \\"patriot and a fighter\\". The hospital said Mr Scalise had suffered fractured bones, internal organ injuries and severe bleeding and would require further operations. What we know about James T Hodgkinson The lawmakers were practising for the annual congressional ballgame that organisers vowed would go ahead as planned on Thursday at Nationals Park, home of Major League Baseball team the Washington Nationals. Alexandria police said the FBI was taking over the investigation into the shooting, which began shortly after 07:00 (11:00 GMT) on Wednesday morning at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park. As well as Mr Scalise, two police officers who protect him, Krystal Griner and David Bailey, lobbyist Matt Mika and Zack Barth, a congressional aide for Texas lawmaker Roger Williams, were injured. Mr Barth, a former staffer for two Republican congressmen, was shot in the chest, according to witness Arizona Senator Jeff Flake. Mr Flake told reporters he was at bat during the shooting and the victims were \\"sitting ducks\\". Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, said someone at the baseball field had used a belt as a tourniquet on Mr Scalise, who is the number three House Republican. South Carolina congressman Jeff Duncan said the suspect had asked him whether Republicans or Democrats were practising, before shots rang out. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul told Fox News: \\"I do believe without the Capitol Hill police it would have been a massacre. \\"We had no defence at all. The field was basically a killing field.\\" He said they were lucky that Mr Scalise was present because he has a security detail owing to his congressional seniority. US lawmakers receive police protection while they are at the Capitol building, but only certain high-ranking House and Senate figures - believed to number about 10 in total - have a round-the-clock security detail wherever they are. Just a handful of top congressional leaders used to have that privilege, but it was broadened after 9/11 to include the whips, according to The Hill. However, other members can get protection too if, for example, threats have been made. Some of those not eligible for constant protection carry guns in their home districts if the state laws allow it, and lawmakers can also organise local police protection for their events. When Democrat representative Gabrielle Giffords was shot in January 2011 in Arizona while speaking to constituents, no police were providing security. The latest shooting has triggered a fresh debate around the issue. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, told CNN he was on third base during the baseball game when he saw Mr Scalise, who was on second base, shot. He said Mr Scalise had a bullet hole in his leg, but was saying: \\"I'm OK, I'm OK.\\" Mr Brooks said everyone on the field scattered as 50 to 100 shots were fired. He said a gunfight had ensued between the shooter and the congressmen's police security detail, who were armed with pistols. Mr Brooks, who took refuge behind a batting cage, said the gunman was armed with a rifle and was \\"blasting away\\" from behind the dugout. Mr Brooks said congressmen Chuck Fleischmann, of Tennessee, Ron DeSantis, of Florida, and Jeff Duncan, of South Carolina, were among 15-25 other lawmakers at the game. Asked by a CNN host if the attack was deliberate, Mr Brooks replied: \\"Well, it sure as heck wasn't an accident! \\"He was going after elected officials, congressmen.\\" Mr Brooks continued: \\"The only weapon I had was a baseball bat and that's not the kind of fight you want to engage in.\\" Ohio congressman Brad Wenstrup, who served in Iraq as a combat surgeon from 2005-06, provided medical care at the scene. He said the attack had lasted for at least 10 minutes, adding: \\"He had a lot of ammo.\\" Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown said his officers had responded and engaged the shooter within three minutes. The last member of Congress to be targeted by a gunman was Democrat Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head as she met constituents in Tucson, Arizona, in January 2011. She survived, but six others died in that incident. Ms Giffordsâ€ Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"House of Representatives Majority Whip Steve Scalise was critically injured in an early morning shooting at a park in Alexandria, Virginia.

Given the question: Question: When picking up drinks, what kind requires you to hold them by the neck? Choices: - glass - shoulder - body - guillotine - bottle The rationale to choose \\"bottle\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"\\"bottle\\" The rationale for choosing \\"bottle\\" as the answer when picking up drinks that require you to hold them by the neck lies in the understanding of the different options provided and the characteristics of each choice in relation to holding a beverage container. Here is a detailed examination of each choice and why bottle is the most appropriate answer: 1. Glass: While it is true that beverage glasses exist in various shapes and sizes, their intended method of being held is not by the neck. Beverage glasses such as wine glasses, pint glasses, and highball glasses are typically held by their base or body for stability and to keep the drink at the desired temperature. Holding a glass by the neck is not practical or ergonomic. 2. Shoulder: The term \\"shoulder\\" in this context is not directly related to a beverage container or the way to hold one. It may refer to the body part, but this choice does not align with the given question. 3. Body: The body of a beverage container, such as a can, bottle, or glass, typically refers to the main or cylindrical part of the container. While it is common to hold the body of a can or glass to drink from it, the specific question asks for a type of drink that requires holding it by the neck. 4. Guillotine: A guillotine is a historical beheading apparatus and not related to beverage containers or how to hold them. Therefore, it is an irrelevant choice for this question. 5. Bottle: Bottles, such as those used for beer or wine, have a distinctive neck that is narrower than their body. This design allows for better control and grip, preventing the bottle from slipping out of your hand. Holding a bottle by its neck also helps maintain the temperature of the drink inside, as your hand does not come into contact with the main body of the container. Thus, it is a practical and intended way to hold a bottle while drinking from it. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"bottle\\" as the answer for the given question lies in its design, where a narrow neck is present, providing better control, grip, and temperature preservation compared to the other choices. The other options do not fulfill the requirements of the question, with some being unrelated to beverage containers, and others not having a neck specifically designed for holding the drink."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: A well-balanced diet of whole foods, fresh fruits, and plentiful vegetables can do wonders for your skin. A healthy body means healthy skin! In turn, healthy skin is more likely to be free of blemishes, imperfections, uneven complexion issues, and red or dry patches. Eat fruits and vegetables of all colors to ensure you get a rich variety of vitamins and minerals. Eat foods that are rich in vitamin C, which can help make your skin paler. Vitamin C also promotes skin elasticity because it helps the body with collagen production. Consume foods and drinks that are high in antioxidants. This can help fight the signs of aging, including dull, discolored, and wrinkled skin. There is such a thing as too much water, but your skin and body still need to be hydrated for proper health. Drink when you are thirsty, especially if you are exercising. Hydrating your skin should help keep it from becoming dry and flaky, and it may even promote a \\"glowing\\" appearance. Cardiovascular exercise is great for your heart and lungs, and it also promotes circulation. Strong circulation is essential for healthy skin. Exercise also reduces stress, which can help alleviate conditions that cause redness (e.g. acne and eczema.) People who suffer from skin conditions like rosacea, psoriasis, or eczema should exercise in cool environments to avoid flare-ups. Moisturize before and after a workout to keep the skin happy. To take care of your skin: wash it daily with a gentle cleanser, exfoliate once or twice a week, and moisturize daily. Exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, which can leave your skin looking fresher and cleaner. Dirt can often contribute to darker-looking skin. Like exercise, a skin massage can promote healthy circulation. Before bed, take a few moments to massage lotion or aloe vera thoroughly into your skin. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of a well-balanced diet, hydration, and exercise for maintaining healthy skin.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Cine este vinovat? Translate to English","completion":"Who is guilty? In order to provide a detailed and long answer, we first need to understand the context in which the question is asked. The statement \\"Who is guilty?\\" is quite broad and can refer to various situations. Since there is no specific background or context provided, I will address different possibilities where this question may arise. 1. In a legal context: In a court of law, determining who is guilty primarily depends on the evidence provided and the legal procedures that establish guilt or innocence for the accused individual. The process involves a thorough investigation, collection of evidence, and testimony from witnesses, ultimately leading the judge or jury to decide if the accused is guilty or innocent. 2. In a moral or ethical context: \\"Who is guilty?\\" might also refer to blame being assigned amid an ethical or moral predicament. In such cases, morality often varies from person to person and culture to culture, so there may not be a unilateral answer. It depends on one's own beliefs, values, and principles when judging if someone is guilty in a moral or ethical sense. 3. In a personal or social context: Conflicts or disputes could occur between individuals or within social groups, where someone's actions might cause harm or distress to others, and the question of guilt arises. In this case, the guilty party may not necessarily have committed an illegal act, but guilt may still be attributed due to a perceived violation of social norms, trust, or expectations. 4. In Literature: This concept of guilt is often explored in literature and the arts, where the actions of characters and their reactions to the consequences of these actions reveal different forms of guilt. The exploration of guilt in literary contexts can delve into various human emotions, moral dilemmas, and socio-political issues. 5. In historical context: \\"Who is guilty?\\" might refer to the assignment of blame for specific events or periods in human history. Historians examine primary and secondary sources to understand the motives, actions, and decisions taken by individuals and groups to determine who bears primary responsibility for historical occurrences. 6. Collective guilt: In some cases, the question of guilt could refer to an entire community or a society rather than just an individual. This arises from the idea that individuals collectively contribute to specific events and outcomes through their actions and inactions. In conclusion, the question of \\"Who is guilty?\\" can have multiple meanings depending on the context it is asked in. To provide an accurate and comprehensive answer, it is crucial to know more details surrounding the situation in question. This could include understanding the legal, moral, ethical, personal, social, historical, or collective aspects underpinning the issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who resented the marriage? is inside the article: Ottavio's marriage troubled Alessandro; he struggled with the burden of chastity and entertained fantasies of marrying a princess. He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he \\"became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor.\\" In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given as a means to strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost.

El Chicó venía de conseguir un empate en la fecha pasada contra su rival de patio, el Patriotas Fútbol, mientras que el conjunto azucarero había conseguido una victoria en casa contra el Once Caldas. Al comienzo del juego ambos equipos mostraron fútbol ofensivo e intentaron marcar pronto, el primer remate a arco lo hizo el equipo local pero llego fácilmente a las manos del guardameta Faryd Mondragón. \\"Manga\\" escobar sería el encargado de abrir el marcador cuando el reloj marcaba apenas 8 minutos de juego. La jugada nació de un escape por el lateral derecho de Brayan Perea, quien centro al área local y encontró a Escobar, para que este último disparara de pierna izquierda, lanzando un disparo que el arquero del cuadro \\"ajedrezado\\" no alcanzó a desviar. El Deportivo Cali siguió manejando el balón durante el primer tiempo, creando algunas situaciones de riesgo que el equipo no logró concretar y mostrando como mejor jugador a Manga Escobar, el Chicó llego pocas veces de la mano de Pérez y Chica, pero sin crear mayores complicaciones para la defensa verde. Para el final del primer tiempo el conjunto azucarero era quien dominaba el balón y las jugadas de peligro. Para la segunda mitad, el equipo local salió a buscar el empate y logró controlar bien el terreno de juego, poniendo en dificultades a la escuadra visitante. Sin embargo, el Deportivo Cali aprovechaba el vacío defensivo que dejaba su rival para realizar rápidos contraataques. En el momento más reñido del partido, y cuando el equipo ajedrezado mostraba con su fútbol que se acercaban al empate, una jugada afortunada le dio al equipo visitante su segundo gol. El juvenil Harrison Mojica lanzó un centro al área que buscaba encontrar a Brayan \\"el coco\\" Perea, Brayan que entraba diagonalmente al área dejó a todos los defensas atrás, mientras que el arquero Alejandro Niño salió un poco del arco para reducir el área de disparo de Perea, con tan mala suerte que \\"el coco\\" no alcanzó a tocar el balón y el arquero local no pudo atrapar el disparo centrado de Mojica, que finalmente resulto en gol. El Deportivo Cali se ponía 2-0 faltando 22 minutos para el pitido reglamentario. El descuento para el Chicó llegó al minuto 38 de parte de Devis Oliveros, después de un mal despeje en el área, un compañero bajo de pecho el balón y le dejó el esférico a Oliveros para que con un contundente remate desde fuera del área sentenciara el 2-1. Esto complico un poco el partido para el conjunto visitante. Los últimos minutos fueron de ataques constantes de ambas escuadras, sin embargo el resultado fue definitivo.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the alias of the person who disables a robot? ? In a technologically-advanced 1939, the zeppelin Hindenburg III moors itself atop the Empire State Building. Aboard the airship is Dr. Jorge Vargas, a scientist who arranges for a package containing two vials to be delivered to Dr. Walter Jennings. The courier looks back while leaving with the vials, to see that Dr. Vargas has vanished. Polly Perkins, a reporter for The Chronicle, is looking into the disappearances of Vargas and five other renowned scientists. A cryptic message leads her to Radio City Music Hall, against the warnings of her editor, Mr. Paley, where she meets Dr. Jennings during a showing of The Wizard of Oz. He tells her that a Dr. Totenkopf is coming for him next. Suddenly, seemingly indestructible robots attack the city. Clearly outmatched, the authorities call for \\"Sky Captain\\" Joe Sullivan, the city's hero and Perkins' ex-lover and the commander of the private air force the Flying Legion. While Joe engages the robots with his modified Curtiss P-40 pursuit fighter, Perkins photographs from the street with little regard for her personal safety. He eventually manages to disable one robot; the rest leave thereafter. News reports show similar attacks around the globe. The disabled robot is taken back to the Legion's air base so that technology expert Dex can examine it. Polly follows and convinces Joe to reluctantly let her in on the investigation.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"While the underlying concept behind laptop chargers for both Sony and Apple is the same - providing power to the laptop while also charging the battery - the design, manufacturing processes, and company philosophies of Sony and Apple differ. We'll examine how each of these companies make their laptop chargers, keeping in mind that information on their exact manufacturing processes is proprietary and highly guarded. 1. How does Sony make laptop chargers? Sony, a Japanese multinational conglomerate, produces a wide range of electronic products, including laptop chargers. Sony's laptop chargers are typically designed for their VAIO line of laptops. When Sony designs and produces laptop chargers, they follow these general steps: Step 1: Design and Development Sony's engineers and specialists design laptop chargers according to the specifications and requirements of the particular VAIO laptop. This includes determining factors such as power output, voltage, amperage, connector type, and protective circuits, ensuring compatibility with the device while maintaining the desired performance and safety standards. Step 2: Sourcing Materials and Components Once the design is finalized, Sony works with suppliers and manufacturers to source the necessary components, materials, and parts for production. This involves procuring parts such as electrical components, cables, connectors, plastic enclosures, and other specific materials required for the charger. Step 3: Assembly and Integration Following the arrival of the necessary components, assembly of the laptop charger begins. This process typically involves the use of specialized machines and robotics, as well as highly skilled technicians. Parts such as the charger's transformer, voltage regulators, capacitors, resistors, and connectors are assembled and secured in place. Step 4: Quality Control and Testing Quality control and testing are crucial for ensuring the safety and performance of the laptop chargers. Sony uses rigorous testing methods to ensure their chargers meet international safety and quality standards. Each charger undergoes various tests, such as electrical performance, safety features, and thermal management. Step 5: Packaging and Distribution Once the chargers receive the green light from the quality control team, they are packed and shipped globally to retailers, authorized service centers, and directly to customers as replacement chargers. 2. How does Apple make laptop chargers? Apple, an American multinational technology company, is known for its obsession with design, build quality, and the user experience. Laptop chargers for Apple's MacBook product line are no exception. The production process for Apple laptop chargers includes several steps: Step 1: Design and Development Apple's design team develops its laptop chargers in-house, aiming to create chargers that are sleek, compact, and complementary to their MacBook line. They consider power output, voltage, amperage, connector type (such as MagSafe or USB-C), and protective circuits to ensure high performance, safety, and compatibility. Step 2: Sourcing Materials and Components Similar to Sony, Apple works with suppliers and manufacturers to source the necessary components and materials for their laptop chargers. Apple is particularly focused on using high-quality components, maintaining strong relationships with suppliers, and ensuring that its supply chain meets strict quality and environmental standards. Step 3: Assembly and Integration Apple's chargers are assembled using state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and techniques. The assembly process is predominantly automated, with specialized machines and robotics responsible for assembling components, soldering, and securing parts. Human technicians oversee the process to ensure smooth execution and quality control. Step 4: Quality Control and Testing Maintaining the Apple brand's reputation for high-quality products, quality control and testing is a top priority. Apple laptop chargers undergo a plethora of tests to ensure they meet not only international safety standards but also Apple's own stringent quality standards. These tests include electrical performance, safety features, and thermal management. Step 5: Packaging and Distribution After passing quality control checks, Apple's laptop chargers are packaged and distributed to Apple stores, authorized retailers, and directly to customers as replacement chargers or part of a new MacBook package. While the questions about how Sony and Apple make laptop chargers are similar in nature, they are not the same question, as they refer to different companies with distinct design philosophies, production processes, and company values. Comparing the two provides insight into their respective approaches to developing and producing laptop chargers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

At the core it is really hot. All that heat tries to rise toward the surface. In the Mantle, the rock is partially melted and is able to move. As it is heated, the material in the mantle moves toward the surface. As the mantle material rises, it cools. When it reaches the Earths crust, it is mostly stopped. A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all. Instead, it begins to move horizontally. The mantle material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest.

Saks recants on controversial stance on transgender discrimination After sparking outrage, luxury retailer Saks & Company is backing away from controversial statements it made about transgender bias in the workplace. Last month, Saks said that transgender employees are not covered under the ban on sex discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The company took that stance when it asked a judge in federal district in Texas to dismiss a lawsuit filed this fall by former selling associate Leyth Jamal, who claims she was harassed and retaliated against because of her transgender identity. Jamal said in her lawsuit that her coworkers at a Saks store in Houston referred to her as a man and forced her to use the men’s bathroom. A manager suggested that she make her appearance more masculine and “separate her home life from work life.” Saks fired Jamal in 2012 after she filed a discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to the complaint. In its defense, Saks argued that discrimination based on gender identity was not prohibited by federal law. The statement was in stark contrast to recent actions by the federal government advocating for the protection of transgender employees. In late December, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that, going forward, the Justice Department would consider discrimination against transgender people as covered by the Civil Rights Act’s prohibition of sex discrimination. Holder’s statement came a few months after the EEOC—the government agency that enforces the federal employment discrimination laws—filed its first-ever lawsuits to protect transgender workers under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. And in July, President Barack Obama issued an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against workers based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Saks then began to feel the heat from other corners of the legal world. In response to Saks’ filing in late December, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent a letter to Saks inquiring about its anti-discrimination policies for employees in New York. The Human Rights Campaign and National Center for Lesbian Rights chimed in with a court filing that said that Saks’ “position that Title VII does not protect transgender workers from the types of discrimination and harassment alleged in [Jamal’s] complaint is wrong as a matter of law.” In response to the heightening backlash, Saks on Monday said that it would withdraw its December 29 filing that said that transgender employees were not protected from discrimination under Title VII. Saks’ withdrawal came just before the Justice Department blasted the retailer in a filing on Monday. “Saks maintains that Ms. Jamal cannot prevail on a Title VII sex discrimination claim that is based on her gender identity, particularly her transgender status. Not so. Discrimination against an individual based on gender identity is discrimination because of sex.” The retailer still plans to fight Jamal’s lawsuit on its merits. In a motion to withdrawal filed on Monday, Saks said that it is confident that, “as this matter proceeds, the facts will demonstrate that the plaintiff’s allegations are wholly without merit” and that “Saks did not discriminate against [her].” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are as follows: 1. Luxury retailer Saks & Company originally took a controversial stance on transgender discrimination, claiming that transgender employees were not covered under the ban on sex discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 2.

(a). No. (b). Yes. A:","completion":"(a). No. The statement provided is not a reasonable answer to the question asked. The question aims to know the number of states that have open carry gun laws, while the statement offers a description of some advocacy groups and a potential trend in open carry laws without mentioning any specific numbers or state names. A more suitable response to the question would be as follows: In the United States, open carry laws vary from state to state. As of 2021, there are 31 states that allow open carry of firearms without a permit, while 15 states require a permit to open carry. A total of 46 states have open carry laws in some form. Although it is true that activism from groups like OpenCarry.org, GeorgiaCarry.org, and the Free State Project has played a role in the promotion of open carry practices, this information does not address the number of states with such laws in place.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Beast Context: The film is prefaced with a quotation from the poem \\"The Young British Soldier\\" by Rudyard Kipling: When you're wounded an' left on Afghanistan's plains An' the women come out to cut up your remains Jus' roll to your rifle an' blow out your brains An' go to your Gawd like a soldier. In 1981 Afghanistan, a Soviet tank unit viciously attacks a Pashtun village harboring a group of mujahideen fighters. Following the assault, one of the tanks, commanded by the ruthless Commander Daskal (George Dzundza), gets separated from the unit and enters a blind valley. Taj (Steven Bauer) returns to discover the village destroyed, his father killed and his brother martyred by being crushed under the tank, to serve as execution for disabling and killing a Russian tank crew. As the new khan, following his brother's death, Taj is spurred to seek revenge by his cousin, the opportunistic scavenger Mustafa - and together they lead a band of mujahideen fighters into the valley to pursue the separated tank, counting on their captured RPG-7 anti-tank weapon to destroy it. The tank's crew is made up of four Soviets and an Afghan communist soldier. As night falls and the crew sets up camp, the Afghan tank crewman Samad (Erick Avari) educates the tank driver, Konstantin Koverchenko (Jason Patric), about the fundamental principles of Pashtunwali, the Pashtun people's code of honour: milmastia (hospitality), badal (revenge), and nanawatai, which requires even an enemy to be given sanctuary if he asks. As the plot progresses, Commander Daskal (called \\"Tank Boy\\" during World War II for destroying a number of German tanks when he was a child soldier during the Battle of Stalingrad) demonstrates his ruthlessness not only to the enemy, but also to his own men. He despises Samad for his ethnic association to the enemy and, after a couple of attempts to kill him, finally gets his wish on the pretext of suspecting Samad of collaborating with the mujahadeen.

Ukraine's newly-appointed defence minster has pledged to to retake Crimea from Russian control promising a victory parade in the key city of Sevastopol. The parliament in Kiev erupted with cheers following the remark made by Colonel General Valeriy Heletey, 46, a former policeman who previously headed the state's VIP bodyguard service. Heletey was recommended for the position by President Petro Poroshenko as someone who would work day and night to revitalise Ukraine's armed forces. In his address, Heletey, who replaces Mikhailo Koval, said: 'Believe me, there will be a victory parade -- there will be for sure -- in Ukraine's Sevastopol.' Russian troops annexed Crimea, home. to a Russian-speaking majority, in March following a widely-disputed. referendum in which 96.7 per cent reportedly voted to become part of. Russia. It comes as government troops continue their bloody offensive against pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine who have declared independence and occupied government buildings. Ukraine and the West say Russia is helping arm the rebels and letting its citizens cross the border to fight, while key allies France and Germany are pushing Poroshenko to pursue talks over attacks. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a conference call yesterday during which they appealed to him to put pressure on the rebels in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. President Poroshenko said he was prepared to order a ceasefire providing it was observed by both sides, all hostages were freed and borders secured by government forces. Poroshenko also appointed Lieutenant. General Viktor Muzhenko as chief of the military's general staff and. Yury Kosyuk, an agriculture magnate and one of Ukraine's richest men, to. oversee defense issues in the presidential administration. Heletey was recommended for the position by President Petro Poroshenko, right, as someone who would work day and night to revitalise Ukraine's armed forces. He told the parliament: 'Today the revival of the army is starting from the scratch, the army which is capable of fighting and winning. 'I have witnessed that during meetings with soldiers and officers while visiting the zone of anti-terrorist operations - the army which knows how to and is able to defend its people and country,' he added. Ukrainian astronomers have named a star 'Putin is a D**khead' in a jibe aimed at the hated Russian president. The star was adopted and named through the Pale Blue Dot Project, which allows anyone to adopt and name a star for just 10, with the money going to fund the hunt for Earth-like planets. The co-ordinates of star which is officially named 'Putin Huilo' are: Celestial Star: right Ascension: 18 h 59 m 47.09 s Slope: 46 * 26 '44', 'magnitude: 11. The term Putin Huilo is belived to have been coined by football fans and was widely chanted at matches, before being picked up by rock bands and becoming a popular internet meme. It was widely shouted during the Maidan protest in Kiev which resulted in the ousting of President Yanukovych and his government. Kiev has struggled to re-assert control over the country's industrial east, where fighting between government troops and pro-Russia separatists has claimed more than 400 lives since April. The army has been unable to prevent rebels from occasionally cruising the countryside in armored vehicles or to dislodge them from the occupied town of Slovyansk. Yesterday three Ukrainian traffic police officers were shot dead after unknown gunmen wearing camouflage uniforms opened fire. The incident took place near the main railway station in Donetsk - the largest city in eastern Ukraine, where clashes between government troops and pro-Russia separatists are ongoing. At least 250 civilians, almost 200 soldiers and at least 800 rebels have been killed in eastern Ukraine since April. According to figures released by the UN at least 110,000 people have left Ukraine for Russia this year, the majority from eastern regions. The insurrection started after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was driven from office by a protest movement among people wanting closer ties with the European Union instead of Russia. Russia called Yanukovych's ouster a coup by radical nationalists and seized Ukraine's Russian-speaking Crimea region. Ukraine says Russia is now backing the insurgency. Poroshenko was elected in a special election May 25 to replace Yanukovych.

Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, anthropologists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, have conducted a genetic analysis of human body lice that suggests clothing originated quite recently, around 170,000 years ago. Body lice is an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern Homo sapiens away from the warm climate of Africa, thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago (Reed et al. 2004. PLoS Biology 2(11): e340).

This method results in a texture resembling a traditional slurpee and maintains the proper temperature for serving and consuming. In the first option, you begin by freezing Coke or your desired cola soda in an ice tray. This step allows the soda to solidify while maintaining its flavor. Freezing the soda to create ice cubes can take several hours, so it is essential to plan ahead and give yourself enough time to allow the cubes to freeze entirely. Once the Coke cubes are fully frozen, transfer them to a blender. Mixing on low at first helps break up the larger ice chunks without over-taxing the blender motor. As the larger pieces begin to break down, increase the blender's speed to create a smooth, slushy texture. This method will yield a frozen beverage with the desired consistency and temperature. Adding 1/2 cup of liquid Coke to the blender with the frozen Coke cubes is a crucial step that enables the blending process to run smoothly. The liquid works with the blender's blades to help break down the larger frozen pieces and creates a cohesion between ice shards, resulting in a uniform consistency. Once well blended, serve the Coke slurpee in a glass and enjoy a refreshing, homemade frozen treat. Option 2, on the other hand, involves boiling the frozen Coke, which would result in a hot, melting substance, not resembling a slurpee at all. This method would also lead to losing carbonation and potentially altering the cola's flavor. In conclusion, the best solution for making Coke slurpees at home is Option 1, where you freeze Coke in an ice tray, then blend the frozen Coke cubes with 1/2 cup Coke to achieve the desired consistency and temperature for a delicious and refreshing slurpee-like beverage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Information: - Similarity refers to the psychological nearness or proximity of two mental representations . It is one of the principles of grouping in Gestalt psychology According to Daniel Schachter \`\` Regions that are similar in color , lightness , shape , or texture are perceived as belonging to the same object '' Research in cognitive psychology has taken a number of approaches to the concept of similarity . Each of them is related to a particular set of assumptions about knowledge representation . - Attention is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether deemed subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information. It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneous objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. Attention has also been referred to as the allocation of limited processing resources. - Personality psychology is a branch of psychology that studies personality and its variation among individuals. Its areas of focus include: - Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. This field examines change across a broad range of topics including: motor skills, cognitive development, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept and identity formation. - Perception (from the Latin \\"perceptio, percipio\\") is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the environment. All perception involves signals in the nervous system, which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the sense organs. For example, vision involves light striking the retina of the eye, smell is mediated by odor molecules, and hearing involves pressure waves. Perception is not the passive receipt of these signals, but is shaped by learning, memory, expectation, and attention. - Mental process or mental function are all the things that individuals can do with their minds. These include perception, memory, thinking (such as ideation, imagination, belief, reasoning, etc.), volition, and emotion. Sometimes the term \\"cognitive function\\" is used instead. - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences. - Abnormal psychology is the branch of psychology that studies unusual patterns of behavior, emotion and thought, which may or may not be understood as precipitating a mental disorder. Although many behaviours could be considered as abnormal, this branch of psychology generally deals with behavior in a clinical context. There is a long history of attempts to understand and control behavior deemed to be aberrant or deviant (statistically, morally or in some other sense), and there is often cultural variation in the approach taken. The field of abnormal psychology identifies multiple causes for different conditions, employing diverse theories from the general field of psychology and elsewhere, and much still hinges on what exactly is meant by \\"abnormal\\". There has traditionally been a divide between psychological and biological explanations, reflecting a philosophical dualism in regard to the mind body problem. There have also been different approaches in trying to classify mental disorders. Abnormal includes three different categories; they are subnormal, supernormal and paranormal. - Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes such as \\"attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and thinking.\\" Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines of psychological study, including educational psychology, social psychology, personality psychology, abnormal psychology, developmental psychology, and economics. - Educational Psychology is the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of human learning. The study of learning processes, from both cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan. - Social psychology is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. In this definition, \\"scientific\\" refers to the empirical method of investigation. The terms \\"thoughts\\", \\"feelings\\", and \\"behaviors\\" include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others' presence may be \\"imagined\\" or \\"implied\\" suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms. Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and immediate social situations. - Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes. It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of cognition. Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform information. Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language, perception, memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology. The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from learning and decision to logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization. The fundamental concept of cognitive science is that \\"thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures.\\" - A mental representation (or cognitive representation), in philosophy of mind, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science, is a hypothetical internal cognitive symbol that represents external reality, or else a mental process that makes use of such a symbol: \\"a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this.\\" Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'facet of' with 'cognition'. A:","completion":"Several entities have the relation 'facet of' with 'cognition' according to the information provided. These entities include: 1. Similarity: As part of Gestalt psychology, similarity connects mental representations based on attributes such as color, lightness, shape, or texture. 2. Attention: The cognitive process of selectively concentrating on specific information while ignoring other information. 3. Perception: The organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information to understand the environment. 4. Mental process or mental function: Activities of the mind, including perception, memory, thinking, volition, and emotion. Additionally, different branches of psychology and cognitive science, such as cognitive psychology, educational psychology, social psychology, and cognitive science itself, also study various facets of cognition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics. Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said. Democrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \\"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are. This is an election to tell the world who we are and what we stand for.\\" Question: What is probably true about the Senate position in Alabama? Options: - The position has fluctuated throughout the years between Democratic and Republican candidates. - It has a history of Republican candidates filling that position. - not enough information - It has not once been filled by a Democratic candidate. === The correct answer is A:","completion":"It has a history of Republican candidates filling that position. The state of Alabama has been largely Republican for many years. Jeff Sessions, the previous senator, was a member of the Republican party, and the two candidates mentioned are a Democrat (Doug Jones) and a Republican (Roy Moore), suggesting that both Democrats and Republicans have the possibility of filling the position. However, given Alabama's history, it is more commonly occupied by Republican candidates. It's important to note that this doesn't completely rule out the possibility of a Democratic candidate; Doug Jones, the Democrat mentioned, won the 2017 special election against Roy Moore. Thus, the Senate position could potentially fluctuate between Democratic and Republican candidates, but it has a stronger history of Republican representation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Egyptians begrudgingly accepted the Ptolemies as the successors to the pharaohs of independent Egypt, though the kingdom went through several native revolts. The Ptolemies took on the traditions of the Egyptian Pharaohs, such as marrying their siblings (Ptolemy II was the first to adopt this custom), having themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participating in Egyptian religious life. The Ptolemaic ruler cult portrayed the Ptolemies as gods, and temples to the Ptolemies were erected throughout the kingdom. Ptolemy I even created a new god, Serapis, who was combination of two Egyptian gods: Apis and Osiris, with attributes of Greek gods. Ptolemaic administration was, like the Ancient Egyptian bureaucracy, highly centralized and focused on squeezing as much revenue out of the population as possible though tariffs, excise duties, fines, taxes and so forth. A whole class of petty officials, tax farmers, clerks and overseers made this possible. The Egyptian countryside was directly administered by this royal bureaucracy.

Look for unique flavor combinations, spices, and chili cooking techniques. 2. Choose your base: Decide whether you want to make vegetarian chili or chili with meat (such as beef, pork, or chicken). This decision will influence the ingredients and the overall cooking process. 3. Select high-quality ingredients: To make an award-winning chili, it's essential to use the best ingredients available. This includes fresh vegetables, high-quality meats (if using), aromatic spices, and quality canned tomatoes or tomato paste. 4. Develop your own recipe: Combine the elements from your research with your preferred choice of ingredients to create a unique chili recipe. Keep in mind the desired consistency, spiciness, and flavors you want to achieve. Note down the ratio of ingredients for future reference. 5. Test and tweak: Once you have a recipe, cook your chili several times to test and adjust the ingredients and cooking times. It's important to practice making your chili to perfect its taste and texture. Discuss your chili recipe with friends and family members, asking for their input on the taste, texture, and overall presentation. Incorporate their feedback to improve your recipe. 6. Experiment with spices: The blend of spices is the key to an extraordinary chili. Consider using traditional spices like cumin, paprika, chili powder, and cayenne pepper, but also explore adding unique spices such as smoked paprika or chipotle powder. To attain an optimal spiciness level, carefully measure the quantity of each spice, and adjust accordingly to your preferences. 7. Enhance depth of flavor: One of the secrets to a winning chili is to layer flavors. Adding elements such as a dash of dark chocolate, a shot of espresso, or a splash of beer can bring out a richer and deeper taste. 8. Cook low and slow: Cooking chili at a low temperature for a longer period brings out the flavors and helps meld the spices together. Consider using a slow cooker or cooking the chili on the stovetop for several hours for the best results. 9. Rest the chili: Allowing the chili to rest for at least an hour or better yet, overnight, enhances its flavor and results in a more cohesive dish. 10. Presentation matters: Present your chili in an attractive way, such as serving it in a colorful or unique bowl. Consider garnishing the chili with shredded cheese, chopped green onions, or sour cream to add visual appeal. 11. Keep the details a secret: Make sure not to reveal every aspect of your chili recipe to maintain a competitive edge. When participating in the chili cook-off, present your chili confidently, highlighting the use of quality ingredients and unique flavor combinations. Incorporating these steps while paying close attention to detail and perfecting your unique recipe will aid in creating an award-winning chili for a chili cook-off. Practice, dedication, and creativity are key factors to winning the competition and impressing the judges with your culinary skills."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plants also detect the daily cycle of light and darkness. Do you know how plants respond to these changes? Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off. This dormancy period helps trees. It allows them to survive the cold and dry winter. Plants only want to grow when conditions are right.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. and the situation: Scientists studied mutations on groups of fruit flies. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. Answer the following question: Which group studied more about mutations that cannot be passed to the next generation? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Group B, which presented somatic mutations, was the group that studied more about mutations that cannot be passed to the next generation. These somatic mutations occur in the body cells and do not affect the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, which are responsible for passing genetic information to the next generation. Somatic mutations may lead to various medical conditions, such as cancer, depending on the location of the mutation and the specific gene affected. These mutations can spread throughout the organism as the affected somatic cell divides and replicates its DNA, producing more cells with the same mutation. However, since the mutations are not present in the gametes, they will not be inherited by the offspring. On the other hand, Group A focused on germline mutations, which occur in the DNA of sex cells and can be passed down to the next generation. If a zygote (fertilized egg) contains a germline mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will carry this mutation, potentially causing hereditary diseases if the mutation results in a disease phenotype. Therefore, the group that studied more about mutations that cannot be passed to the next generation is Group B, which dealt with somatic mutations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Tottenham midfielder, who is on a season-long loan with Swansea, scored soon after the break in Prague, capitalising on a goalkeeping mistake. Watford's Matej Vydra went closest for the hosts in the first half when his shot was cleared off the line. The U21 European Championships will be held in Czech Republic in the summer. England lost 3-2 in France in their last match in November, after they had won their previous 11 games, but they returned to the winner's circle after a gritty display at the Letna Stadium. In the 12th minute, Alex Pritchard picked out Cauley Woodrow, who turned and shot just over the bar as England began brightly. However, the Czechs were more dangerous in the rest of first half and Carroll cleared a Matej Vydra shot from a corner off the line shortly before the half-hour. Three minutes into the second half Gareth Southgate's side edged ahead thanks to an opportunistic goal from the impressive Carroll. Nathan Redmond did superbly to nip between two players in midfield before he spread the play out to Chambers. The Arsenal defender's cross was fumbled by Czech goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka and back out into the area, where Carroll arrived to stroke the ball home. Carroll, who captained the side, was withdrawn later in the half after he picked up a knock and was replaced by Derby's Will Hughes. But England's players finished the game strongly and apart from Ondrej Petrak's shot, which flashed past the post, England goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli remained largely untroubled.

Instead, a study concluded, the only way to prevent a hangover is to drink less alcohol. More than 800 students were asked how they tried to relieve hangover symptoms, but neither food nor water was found to have any positive effect. The findings are being presented at a conference in Amsterdam. A team of international researchers from the Netherlands and Canada surveyed students' drinking habits to find out whether hangovers could be eased or if some people were immune to them. Among 826 Dutch students, 54% ate food after drinking alcohol, including fatty food and heavy breakfasts, in the hope of staving off a hangover. With the same aim, more than two-thirds drank water while drinking alcohol and more than half drank water before going to bed. Although these groups showed a slight improvement in how they felt compared with those who hadn't drunk water, there was no real difference in the severity of their hangovers. Previous research suggests that about 25% of drinkers claim never to get hangovers. So the researchers questioned 789 Canadian students about their drinking in the previous month and the hangovers they experienced, finding that those who didn't get a hangover simply consumed \\"too little alcohol to develop a hangover in the first place\\". Of those students who drank heavily, with an estimated blood alcohol concentration of more than 0.2%, almost no-one was immune to hangovers. According to lead author Dr Joris Verster, from Utrecht University, the relationship was pretty straightforward. \\"The more you drink, the more likely you are to get a hangover. \\"Drinking water may help against thirst and a dry mouth, but it will not take away the misery, the headache and the nausea.\\" Dr Verster said part of the problem was that scientists still do not know what causes a hangover. \\"Research has concluded that it's not simply dehydration - we know the immune system is involved, but before we know what causes it, it's very unlikely we'll find an effective cure.\\" He said the next step was to carry out more controlled trials on hangovers. Dr Michael Bloomfield, from University College, London, said the economic costs of alcohol abuse ran into hundreds of billions of euros every year. \\"It's therefore very important to answer simple questions like, 'How do you avoid a hangover?' \\"Whilst further research is needed, this new research tells us that the answer is simple - drink less.\\" The paper is presented at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology conference.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose work was devoted to awakening an awareness of the catastrophes the country suffered? ? The Belarusian government sponsors annual cultural festivals such as the Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk, which showcases Belarusian performers, artists, writers, musicians, and actors. Several state holidays, such as Independence Day and Victory Day, draw big crowds and often include displays such as fireworks and military parades, especially in Vitebsk and Minsk. The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture both inside and outside the country. Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th-century religious scripture, such as the 12th-century poetry of Cyril of Turaw.By the 16th century, Polotsk resident Francysk Skaryna translated the Bible into Belarusian. It was published in Prague and Vilnius sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe. The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century; one prominent writer was Yanka Kupala. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as Uładzimir Žyłka, Kazimir Svayak, Yakub Kolas, Źmitrok Biadula, and Maksim Haretski, wrote for Nasha Niva, a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in Minsk. After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of \\"Belarusianization\\" was followed in the newly formed Byelorussian SSR. This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges. The free development of literature occurred only in Polish-held territory until Soviet occupation in 1939. Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus and would not return until the 1960s.The last major revival of Belarusian literature occurred in the 1960s with novels published by Vasil Bykaŭ and Uladzimir Karatkievich.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: Clickety clack, clickety clack. It was the soundtrack to my Fifties childhood, as my mother and grandmother knitted constantly. Even relaxing in front of the TV, they were never happy unless their hands were occupied. It’s a trait I inherited, and when my own children were small, I was never happier than when I was ‘creating’ something to swathe them in. But by their teenage years the time came when they didn’t want homemade clothes any more. I suppose wearing something knitted by Mum isn’t cool. Jenni says she inherited her love of knitting from her mother and grandmother who knitted non-stop. Now Ed and Charlie are 31 and 27 — and it would have taken me months to do anything for them. So, in the absence of grandchildren, I put away my knitting needles and took up needlepoint. Then, a couple of months ago, I came across a colourful book of knitting patterns for dogs, by the designer and author Debbie Bliss. In the absence of grandchildren Jenni has started knitting for her chihuahuas Butch, Madge and Frida. And I just knew my three chihuahuas, Butch, Madge and Frida (yes, they are definite grandchild substitutes), would love something to keep them warm this winter. Full of excitement, I dug out my yarns and knitting needles again. Knitting is experiencing a renaissance here — with an estimated seven million knitters clacking away in their homes. And a huge number of knitters will own a dog. What’s not to love about a pooch in a homemade poncho? asks Jenni. So what’s not to love about a pooch in a homemade poncho? My two previous pets, William and Mary, miniature schnauzers, had the kind of coats of their own that could be clipped close in the summer and allowed to grow in the winter, so they never noticed the cold. Chihuahuas, though, are different. Mine are short-haired and, as soon as a winter nip sets in, they regard me as a lunatic when I enthusiastically shout: ‘Walkies!’ Chihuahuas are bred for a Mexican climate rather than the chilly British weather. They hide behind the sofa and emerge reluctantly when I put on my bossy ‘leader of the pack’ voice. I then have to endure their pitiful display of shivering the minute we step out of the door. I’ve even faced scathing comments from fellow dog walkers: ‘Poor little things. Don’t you think they should be wrapped up warm?’ My son, Ed, is a vet, and when I asked his opinion of the growing trend of clothes for dogs and whether I should get some for my three he was scornfully dismissive. ‘If a dog needs a coat it shouldn’t be living in this country. They’re chihuahuas, for goodness sake, bred for the Mexican climate. And they are dogs, Mother. They shouldn’t be treated like pampered, spoilt babies.’ Jenni has lavished love and affection on her pets since her sons Ed and Charlie left home. So my poor little chihuahuas just aren’t built for the chilly British winter. But they do make adorable companions . . . always welcoming, never making demands or expressing disapproval of Mummy — the way children do. To be honest, I think Ed may be a teensy bit jealous of my canine kids, given the love and affection I’ve lavished upon them since he and his brother flew the nest. Debbie Bliss told me she was inspired to create a range of patterns for dog wear because every time she went to talk to her editor about knitting books they ended up talking about their dogs. Combining her two greatest passions in life seemed like an inspired idea. Her pets — Smiffy, the Parsons Jack Russell and Monty, the beagle — seemed happy in the sweaters, and Debbie soon compiled enough doggy patterns for a book. It’s illustrated with lots of fun photos of dogs in jumpers, including spaniels, bulldogs, collies and Yorkies. The patterns vary in difficulty and can be modified for small, medium and large canines. The size of my three meant there was no point considering the Aran or the stripey sailor suit, because even the small wouldn’t have been small enough (and I’m not sure my skills are up to stripes just yet). Nor was I prepared to humiliate them by knitting the funny hats to go with their coats. My guys would have them off in seconds no matter how tight the elastic used to keep such hats in place. So in the end I went for the Puppy Polo (a jumper with a rollneck to you and me). I excitedly restocked my knitting bag with needles, a stitch holder, row counter, darning needle, tape measure and a strange contraption that helps you knit a rollneck in one piece without seams. I was surprised how quickly the skills came back. Soon I was casting on like lightning, doing rib and stocking stitch and casting off neatly without any trouble. Each jumper took the best part of three evenings — time that has turned out to be very well spent. Jennie's brood - Butch, Madge and Frida in their homemade outfits. Madge happily let me fit hers on and modelled it with her usual panache, prancing about like Kate Moss on speed. I chose hot pink to suit her wild personality. Butch (who has white fur) looked very smart in black, and for Frida I picked a softer pink because I thought it would complement her grey coat. She didn’t seem to mind, though she looked a bit cross when she realised it was a bit too long at the back and wiggled from side to side when she wagged her tail — which she does a lot. I told her what my granny always said to me when she’d stayed up all night to finish a sweater for me for school. ‘Don’t worry love, you’ll grow into it.’ (She won’t!) Jenni thinks carefully about the tones that would suit each of her pet pooch's natural fur colour. This week, on a bit of a chilly day, I took all three to the local park. They ran about happily and were thrilled to be stopped every few minutes by fellow walkers saying: ‘Oh, don’t they look gorgeous, where did you buy their lovely sweaters?’ I almost burst with pride when I answered: ‘I didn’t, I made them myself.’ This substitute Granny is very, very happy indeed.

Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When did the author discover the exhibit Chihuly Garden and Glass?

It tells the story of death row supervisor Paul Edgecombe's encounter with John Coffey, an unusual inmate who displays inexplicable healing and empathetic abilities. The serial novel was originally released in six volumes before being republished as a single volume work. The book is an example of magical realism. Can we draw the following conclusion? John Coffrey has no abilities","completion":"We cannot draw the conclusion that John Coffey has no abilities based on the information provided about \\"The Green Mile.\\" In the 1996 serial novel, written by Stephen King, it is evident that John Coffey, one of the main characters and an inmate on death row, possesses extraordinary abilities. These talents are in sharp contrast with the typical persona of a death row inmate, making Coffey a unique and rather mysterious figure in the prison. John Coffey's abilities include supernatural healing and empathetic capabilities, making him an enigmatic figure on the Green Mile, as the death row supervisor, Paul Edgecombe, comes to learn when he meets Coffey. Throughout the story, the presence and extent of Coffey's powers are revealed in various instances. For example, Coffey's healing powers become apparent when he cures Edgecombe's urinary tract infection and later when he resurrects a dead mouse named Mr. Jingles, transforming it into an almost immortal creature. Moreover, Coffey's empathetic powers are unveiled when he touches other people, experiencing their feelings, thoughts, and even witnessing the crimes they have endured or committed. This empathic ability is pivotal to the plot, as it allows Coffey to reveal and prove the innocence of characters such as Eduard Delacroix and reveal the true psychopath behind the evil acts in the story, prison guard Percy Wetmore. In light of these examples, it is clear that John Coffey holds remarkable, even supernatural, abilities that significantly impact the lives of those he encounters and the narrative progression of the story. As such, it would be far from justifiable to conclude that John Coffey has no abilities based on the information provided about The Green Mile. Instead, it is appropriate to maintain that John Coffey possesses extraordinary, even miraculous powers that serve as crucial elements to the story's plot and themes."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: \\"Belut\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"The Guardians of Truffula\\" Genre: Adventure / Fantasy / Family Plot: Once upon a time in the magical land of Elyria, nestled between the highest mountains and the deepest valleys, lied the enchanted Truffula forest. This forest was home to some of the most breathtaking flora and fauna seen only in this realm. The Truffula trees, known for their vibrantly colored tufts, had a remarkable ability to provide materials for a highly versatile, durable, and luxurious fabric known as Thneed. For centuries, the inhabitants of Elyria managed to live harmoniously with these mystical trees and the creatures of the forest, harvesting Thneed in a responsible and sustainable manner, which attracted traders from far and wide. Unbeknownst to the Elyrians, the secret of the Truffula trees had traveled to the ears of the insatiable clothing mogul, Victoria VanCrest. She, along with her relentless corporation, saw this as an opportunity to dominate the world's fashion industry with the unique and magical Thneed. Hungry for profit and power, Victoria set her sights on the enchanted Truffula Forest in order to exploit its resources. Amber, a spirited and fiercely independent 16-year-old Elyrian girl, had grown up hearing stories of the wonders of Truffula Forest from her grandmother, a local weaver. She possessed a deep connection to the forest, and as fate would have it, she stumbled upon the arrival of VanCrest's minions in Elyria and their plan to strip the Truffula trees bare. Horrified by the potential devastation that could befall the forest, Amber made a vow to protect the trees at any cost and embarked on a perilous journey to acquire the help of the Guardians, mystical beings of untold power who were said to be the true caretakers of the Truffula trees. With the help of Flint, a daring and roguish forest-guide, and Lumi, an enigmatic glowing creature native to the mythic forest, Amber embarked on the adventure of a lifetime. The trio faced many challenges on their way to find the Guardians, including encounters with treacherous beasts, navigating a labyrinth of seemingly endless caverns, and being pursued relentlessly by Victoria's minions who were determined to stop them at all costs. Along her journey, Amber discovered that she had a latent gift for summoning the magic of the Truffula trees, allowing her to harness their ancient elemental powers to overcome various obstacles. At long last, Amber, Flint, and Lumi managed to locate the Guardians' sanctuary, where they learned that Amber's true destiny was to become the chosen protector of the Truffula trees. With their help, the trio must unite the people of Elyria, awaken the long-forgotten spirits of the forest, and stand up against Victoria's corporate army to preserve the enchanted land. Through their trials and tribulations, the group forged unbreakable bonds, amidst the backdrop of an epic, heart-stopping battle for the very soul of the enchanted forest. Thus, the noble heroes fought bravely, ensuring that not only would the Thneeds continue to be crafted sustainably, but also that the Truffula trees remained a symbol of environmental stewardship. In the end, the battle-hardened Elyrians, the mystical Guardians, and our heroes emerged triumphant, and the balance between nature and humanity was in harmony once again. Victoria VanCrest was left with no choice but to forge a more ethical path for her corporation. Elyria was saved, with Amber crowned as the new Guardian of the Truffula Forest, alongside Flint and Lumi, who continued to be her steadfast companions in ensuring the protection of the magical realm. \\"The Guardians of Truffula\\" would not only be an enchanting tale of adventure, friendship, and magic but also remind us of the importance of respecting and preserving the delicate balance of nature, emphasizing that greed and the pursuit of power are no match for the forces of love, unity, and harmony."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Leon Valley police say that Shannon eventually confessed to the crime and was charged with felony theft. RELATED: SA Aquarium theft: Shark returned safely \\"It was wrong to just take him like that. But, at that point in time, it was just something that I had to do,\\" said Shannon, a self-proclaimed activist who says that he has 30 years of personal experience with marine life. In his home, he has three salt water tanks filled with dozens of fish and five sharks. \\"I've been dealing with aquariums since I was 8 years old,\\" said Shannon, who described placing the stolen horn shark in one of his tanks until police later recovered it. \\"I knew it would gain a lot of strength being in a proper environment.” Shannon said that about four weeks ago, a friend told him the San Antonio Aquarium was in poor condition and marine life were dying frequently. \\"So I said, as a salt distributor, I was going to send in a guy, 'Anthony Shannon,' that he's my buddy, he's an aquarist in San Antonio. So when I came, I posed as myself, I got a full tour of the store,\\" Shannon recalled. \\"She showed me everything, and the room, and ‘check out the systems.’\\" RELATED: Shark heist suspect may have posed as supplier to stake out SA Aquarium The General Manager of the San Antonio Aquarium sent this statement on Wednesday: About a month ago Anthony Shannon posed as an employee of Instant Ocean, the company from where we get our marine salts. He stated that we may have been sold a bad batch of salts and he needed to do water quality testing to make sure we were not putting our animals in danger. We have a good working relationship with Instant Ocean and had no reason to doubt his story until he was recognized on camera after the theft by the employee that led him to various back areas to do the testing. Any deceased animals he may have seen while in our back areas were an unfortunate part of being in this business. We take the best possible care of our animals throughout their lives, which unfortunately do end eventually. A giant pacific octopus only lives for about 3 years and are rarely acquired as babies, giving us only a short time with these amazing creatures. Part of taking great care of animals is giving them the best possible diet, full of vitamins and the nutrients they need to survive. Many of our aquatic animals eat things such as krill and capelin, which can be somewhat oily. This oil can cause a slight sheen on the water after a feeding. Our filtration systems clean this out pretty quickly but it takes a few minutes to completely clear the water. We do daily tests of our water throughout the aquarium and show that everything is within normal parameters on the day Helen went missing. We appreciate all of the love and support everyone has shown for Helen and invite everyone to come see her when she's back on exhibit. Shannon claims that on Saturday, when he was visiting the aquarium, he sat for an hour as children and their families played with the animals then saw a shark in distress. RELATED: Take a look inside the home of the man accused of stealing a shark \\"Then I pulled the net out, I told the customers to get out of the way, ‘I'm going to quarantine the shark,’\\" Shannon described. \\"I'm an activist, not a criminal, and basically I don't want to produce any crimes that will make me lose my family or big charges and to open an eye and make things better.\\" Shannon was charged with felony theft of property valued at 2,500 to less than 30,000 for the heist but claims that the horn shark is worth, at most, 800. An online petition on Care2.com asking the the aquarium to close its touch pool has over 15,000 signatures. The petition came about after the shark was taken from the pool.

Shannon was arrested Monday night and charged with felony theft 2,500-30,000. He is no stranger to criminal activity, however, with an extensive rap sheet that includes eight prior arrests. Shannon was indicted in May 2002 for aggravated assault and released eight months later after the case was dismissed. He was booked in April 2000 for theft of a vehicle 1,500-20,000, evading arrest and driving with an invalid license. Shannon has another charge for driving with an invalid license from March 2000. He was fined 150 and sentenced to 45 days in jail. Shannon’s first arrest for theft of a vehicle 1,500-20,000 stems from a June 1998 incident for which he was fined 1,000 and sentenced to one year in prison. In August 1998, Shannon was arrested for hindering an apprehension, and the case was dismissed. He was also arrested in February 1998 for possession of marijuana and Shannon was fined 100 and sentenced to 60 days in jail.

Johnson gives him a list of three cities where the President is scheduled to visit and Swagger assesses a site in Philadelphia as the most likely. This turns out to be a set-up; while Swagger is working with Johnson's agents to find the rumored assassin, the Ethiopian archbishop is instead shot while standing next to the president. Swagger is then shot twice by a city police officer, but manages to escape. The agents tell the police that Swagger is the shooter and stage a manhunt for the injured sniper. However, he meets a rookie FBI special agent, Nick Memphis, disarms him, and steals his car. After his escape, Swagger takes refuge with Sarah Fenn, widow of his late spotter and close friend, killed years before in a mission in Africa. He later convinces her to help him contact Memphis with information on the conspiracy. Memphis is blamed for Swagger's escape and is informed that he will face disciplinary review, but argues that, given Swagger's training and experience, it is surprising that the president survived and the archbishop standing several feet away was killed. He independently learns that Swagger may have been framed for the assassination and is further made suspicious when he learns that the officer who shot Swagger was himself shot dead just hours later in a \\"mugging\\". When the agents realize their secret is compromised, they kidnap Memphis and attempt to stage his suicide. Swagger tails them and kills the captors.

One day Monica shared a needle with a drug addict at a party. She later found out that she'd been infected with HIV. Jill was scared and helped her as much as she could. and a hint : The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ . Please answer this question : Which friend has a virus that is transmitted by sexual contact? Answer:","completion":"Monica is the friend who has contracted a virus that is transmitted by sexual contact. In this situation, Monica shared a needle with a drug addict at a party and later discovered that she had been infected with HIV. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) can be transmitted through various means, including sexual contact, as well as through contact with infected bodily fluids like blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. Sharing needles is another common route of transmission for the virus, as it can expose individuals to infected blood. Upon learning about Monica's infection, Jill became concerned and offered her support and assistance. It is essential for Monica to seek medical care and begin treatment for HIV, which can help manage the virus and potentially delay or prevent the progression to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). While there currently is no cure for HIV, early detection, proper care, and antiretroviral therapy can significantly improve the quality of life and life expectancy for individuals living with the virus. Prevention efforts are crucial in minimizing the spread of HIV. Practicing safer sex, using condoms consistently and correctly, and avoiding sharing needles or other drug paraphernalia are all essential steps that individuals can take to protect themselves and their partners from the transmission of HIV. Additionally, regular HIV testing and knowing one's status is key to ensuring early detection and treatment if necessary, further mitigating the risks associated with the virus. Although HIV/AIDS remains a significant global health issue, with millions of people affected worldwide, advancements in research, treatment, and public health initiatives continue to contribute to the reduction of new infections and improvements in the lives of those living with HIV.

We are provided with four choices: layers, molecules, ligaments, and tissues. To answer this question, we must understand the definitions of each of these terms: 1. Layers: Layers refer to thin sheets or strata of a material or substance that are arranged one on top of another in a particular order. This term does not specifically relate to specialized cells. 2. Molecules: Molecules are the smallest particle in a chemical element or compound that has the chemical properties of that element or compound. They are made up of atoms bonded together. Molecules define the fundamental structure of chemical compounds, but they do not signify a collection of specialized cells. 3. Ligaments: Ligaments are the fibrous connective tissues that connect two bones or cartilages or hold together a joint. They provide stability to the joints and help in overall mobility. While ligaments comprise specialized cells, they do not relate to muscles and skin in particular. 4. Tissues: Tissues are a collection of specialized cells and cell products that work together to perform a specific function within an organism. Tissues are primarily classified into four groups based on their functionality: epithelial tissue covers surfaces and lines organs and cavities, connective tissue provides structural support and binds other tissues, muscle tissue generates force, and neural tissue receives and transmits nerve impulses.

The hypothesis, however, claims that the people are standing on the pile of hay.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. Question: What legislation rebuilds the US military? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"The legislation that rebuilds the US military is the 1.3 trillion spending plan, also known as the \\"omnibus spending bill.\\" This bipartisan bill was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives with a 256-167 vote and aims to keep the government funded until the end of September. The spending plan provides significant financial support to the United States military, fulfilling President Donald Trump's promise to boost military funding. Key provisions of this legislation that directly benefit the military include a substantial budget increase for defense spending and a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. House Speaker Paul Ryan emphasized the importance of this legislation, stating, “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military.” Although the bill provides limited funding for President Trump's immigration agenda, it does allocate 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 93 miles of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. However, this is significantly less than the 25 billion Trump had requested for the project. This spending plan, which the White House claimed President Trump supports, helps to strengthen the US military and signals a renewed focus on national security. Given its bipartisan nature and support, the legislation is a crucial step in rebuilding the United States military and ensuring its continued effectiveness in protecting the nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The anticipation builds as negotiations behind the scenes take place. Among the many possible transfer deals, one stands out as most likely to be finalized before the deadline - Daley Blind from Ajax to Manchester United. In this ending, Manchester United's coach, Louis van Gaal, has long admired Daley Blind's talents, having previously coached him during his time as the Netherlands national team manager. Blind's versatility on the field, combined with his impressive performance at the recent World Cup, makes him an attractive option for strengthening United's lineup. Furthermore, Daley Blind's connection with United's coach also plays a factor in this transfer becoming more feasible. Louis van Gaal's familiarity with Blind's playing style and strengths will help integrate him into the team and potentially have an immediate impact. Consequently, this transfer deal also seems reasonable, unlike some of the other options where players or even reporters like IAN LADYMAN are included, which are not based on any realistic scenarios. Additionally, while many other prominent players are listed, the nature of some of these transfers would be either unlikely or impossible. For example, Diego Costa has already joined Chelsea earlier in the window, making this transfer out of the question. In conclusion, considering the current situation at Manchester United, the coaching staff's familiarity with the player, and the realistic nature of this option, Daley Blind's transfer from Ajax to Manchester United is the most likely to come to pass before the 11 pm deadline on Monday."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). I am facing a new situation today: Two soccer players had a friendly match one on one after work. Paul had plenty of time to do his warm up properly, but John got there late and didn't warm up. Paul won the match. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which player had an increased hear rate before the match? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article and the given situation, the player who had an increased heart rate before the match would be Paul. This is because Paul had plenty of time to do his warm-up properly before the friendly soccer match. As mentioned in the background article, warming up helps in increasing the blood flow to the muscles and the heart rate, making the warmed-up muscles and tendons less likely to get injured. Since John did not have time to warm up before the match, his heart rate would not have been increased to the same extent as Paul's. Therefore, Paul is the player who had an increased heart rate before the match."},{"prompt":"Given the following context: The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \\"Nevertheless\\", he wrote, \\"there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\\". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \\"The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\", he wrote.

One day, he spotted something very unusual while walking near the water. Finlay saw 19 dolphins stuck in shallow water in a place called Lochbuie! They couldn't get back to the deeper water, and they needed help. Quick as a wink, Finlay knew what he had to do. He called for help from his uncle Simon Lane, who was 59 years old. Finlay's mother also heard the call and decided to help too. Together, they all ran down to the shore to help the dolphins. When they got to the water, they bravely waded into the sea and began working as a team to help the dolphins. They knew they had to get the dolphins back to the deep water where they belonged. For two whole hours, Finlay, his uncle and mother patiently and gently moved each dolphin from the shallow water to the deeper water. Some of the heaviest dolphins weighed up to 200 pounds! They used luggage straps to get a grip on the bigger animals and help them safely move to deeper water. Thankfully, someone even took a video of this incredible scene. When people found out about it, they realized that it was the worst case of dolphins getting stuck on the beach in the UK since another sad incident that happened in Cornwall in 2008. Finlay, his mother, and uncle Simon made sure the dolphins were safe and sound. People admired their kindness and bravery.

These factors were crucial in ensuring Quinn’s safety, comfort, and overall well-being. Though it is impossible to pinpoint Aubrey’s precise motivations without knowing their exact relationship and circumstances, the following explanations can provide a general overview of the possible reasons behind Aubrey's decision to pick Quinn up from school. 1. Relationship: Aubrey may be in a close relationship with Quinn. They may be siblings, cousins, or close friends. In such cases, it is common to support each other, and picking someone up from school is just a manifestation of this emotional bond. 2. Responsibility: If Aubrey is a parent, guardian, or caretaker of Quinn, they are likely to feel obligated and responsible for Quinn's safety and well-being. They might pick Quinn up from school to ensure that they safely reach home or other planned activities after school. 3. Carpooling: Aubrey and Quinn might be part of a carpool arrangement, where parents or friends share driving responsibilities to transport children to and from school. This arrangement can be both economically savvy and environmentally friendly. 4. Special Event or Circumstances: There could be a special event or unique circumstance on that day which required Aubrey to pick Quinn up from school. For instance, it may have been a half-day, a day with a special function, or a day when Quinn was not feeling well and needed someone to take them home. 5. Quinn's Needs: Quinn might require assistance or have specific needs that Aubrey can cater to. This could include helping Quinn with homework or providing emotional support upon school dismissal. 6. Schedule Changes: It is also possible that there was a change in Aubrey or Quinn’s schedule that prompted Aubrey to pick up Quinn from school. For example, Aubrey could have had an unexpected change in their schedule or a day off from work, thereby allowing them to be there for Quinn. 7. Safety Concerns: Aubrey may have been worried about Quinn’s safety on their way home from school, especially if there were known issues in the area, such as criminal activity or a dangerous route. By picking Quinn up, Aubrey could ensure their safety, offering peace of mind to both parties involved. 8. Bonding Opportunity: Picking Quinn up from school might allow for more quality time spent together. Such bonding experiences can deepen relationships, leading to positive emotional and psychological benefits. In conclusion, Aubrey's decision to pick Quinn up from school could be attributed to one or a combination of the reasons listed above, such as their relationship, responsibility, carpooling arrangements, special events or circumstances, Quinn's needs, schedule changes, safety concerns, or bonding opportunities.

Answer:","completion":"The Chinese first used gunpowder as a weapon during the 9th century, specifically around the mid-late Tang dynasty (618-907 AD). However, the exact date remains a subject of much debate among historians. Gunpowder, initially known as \\"fire medicine\\" or \\"black powder,\\" had initially been discovered by Chinese alchemists while searching for an elixir of life that promised immortality. In their pursuit to create this potion, they had inadvertently stumbled upon the formula for gunpowder, a mixture of saltpeter (potassium nitrate), sulfur, and charcoal. Though the precise time of gunpowder's invention remains elusive, an influential precursor is a text known as the Wuzazu, written by the Chinese scholar Zeng Gongliang during the Song dynasty (960-1279 AD). This document provides a comprehensive explanation of several gunpowder-based weapons, hinting that the military application of gunpowder had begun much earlier. However, even older documents exist, alluding to the use of gunpowder as a weapon. One such document dating back to 808 AD, the Zhenyuan miaodao yaolüe, details the use of gunpowder in warfare. Another, the Wujing Zongyao, a military compendium written around 1044 AD, offers the first recorded instances of different gunpowder formulas and their military applications. This text describes how gunpowder could be employed to create fire arrows, fire lances, and even simple grenades. Throughout the 11th and 12th centuries, the Chinese continuously developed and improved their gunpowder weaponry, producing the earliest documented firearm, the fire lance. The fire lance primarily served as a flamethrower attached to a vastly extended spear, launching a jet of flames onto enemies. Some fire lances were even designed to fire projectiles, laying the groundwork for the invention of hand-held firearms. By the 13th century, gunpowder technology had spread to Mongol-occupied China, and consequently, to Islamic countries and Europe. The Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) observed advancements in gunpowder warfare such as cannon technology and improved the portability of firearms. Over time, gunpowder weapons became increasingly sophisticated, leading to the creation of a wide range of weapons, including early cannons, rockets, and eventually, handguns, and other firearms. Throughout history, gunpowder has indelibly shaped the world and the way wars were fought, owing primarily to its Chinese roots and initial development. In summary, the Chinese first used gunpowder as a weapon during the 9th century, with the earliest documented evidence dating back to 808 AD. The invention of gunpowder revolutionized warfare with the development of various weapons such as fire lances, fire arrows, grenades, cannons, and rockets. The advancements made by the Chinese in gunpowder technology would later facilitate the rapid dissemination and development of firearms throughout the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His daughter suddenly tells him that she is leaving indefinitely to teach English in Mongolia with her German boyfriend. As Gopal recovers from this shock and tries to talk her out of it, largely on the grounds that she will be living in sin in his eyes, his wife Madhu announces that she is leaving him as well, and is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India. Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few Indian-American acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughter's phone calls from Mongolia. He tries to cope with his emptiness by redecorating slightly, searching through the various corners of his small house, reading newspapers, and watching videos of Bollywood romance extravaganza films. Desperately lonely, he latches upon a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine that had belonged to his daughter, and takes a quiz gauging a man's suitability for a relationship – which reveals that he is a \\"Ditchable Dude\\". In the midst of his distress and his Bollywood fantasies, Gopal's eccentric neighbor, the oddly attractive divorcée Mrs. Shaw – whom he had previously thought of as loose-moralled (because of her one-night stands) and slovenly – appears at his door asking to borrow one of his rakes. This sets off a whole new set of fantasies on his part. A few nights later Gopal sees her on her porch nursing a drink, and after a tentative conversation, asks her to have Thanksgiving dinner with him at home the next day. While cleaning and straightening for the date, Gopal finds several more of his daughter's Cosmopolitans, and reads several articles on \\"What women want\\" from a man – evidently it is for them to \\"listen, listen, listen\\". answer the following question: Whose wife is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India?

Context: Have you ever wondered whether it’s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising? In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.

Native Americans, also known as American Indians, Indians, Indigenous Americans and other terms, are the indigenous peoples of the United States. There are over 500 federally recognized tribes within the U.S., about half of which are associated with Indian reservations. The term excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaska Natives. The ancestors of modern Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago, possibly much earlier, from Asia via Beringia. Iroquois Culture: The Iroquois League of Nations or \\"People of the Long House\\", based in present-day upstate and western New York, had a confederacy model from the mid-15th century. It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the later United States government. Their system of affiliation was a kind of federation, different from the strong, centralized European monarchies.Leadership was restricted to a group of 50 sachem chiefs, each representing one clan within a tribe. The Oneida and Mohawk people had nine seats each; the Onondagas held fourteen; the Cayuga had ten seats; and the Seneca had eight. Representation was not based on population numbers, as the Seneca tribe greatly outnumbered the others. When a sachem chief died, his successor was chosen by the senior woman of his tribe in consultation with other female members of the clan; property and hereditary leadership were passed matrilineally. Decisions were not made through voting but through consensus decision making, with each sachem chief holding theoretical veto power. The Onondaga were the \\"firekeepers\\", responsible for raising topics to be discussed. They occupied one side of a three-sided fire (the Mohawk and Seneca sat on one side of the fire, the Oneida and Cayuga sat on the third side.) Elizabeth Tooker, an anthropologist, has said that it was unlikely the US founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy, as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the United States. For example, it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership, selected by female members of the tribes, consensus decision-making regardless of population size of the tribes, and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body. Long-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds. Historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th century, or in the 17th century Beaver Wars. Through warfare, the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River. Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the Osage, Kaw, Ponca and Omaha people. By the mid-17th century, they had resettled in their historical lands in present-day Kansas, Nebraska, Arkansas and Oklahoma. The Osage warred with Caddo-speaking Native Americans, displacing them in turn by the mid-18th century and dominating their new historical territories.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How did they contribute to the political aspects?","completion":"The Iroquois culture is said to have possibly contributed to political thinking during the development of the later United States government.

It is spoken as a first language by around 76 million people and as a second language by more than 235 million people worldwide. Additionally, French is an official language of many international organizations, such as the United Nations, the European Union, and the International Olympic Committee. French has a rich history that dates back to the Roman Empire when Latin was the most widely spoken language in the region that is now France. Over time, regional dialects began to emerge, leading to the development of Old French (between the 9th and 13th centuries). The French language continued to evolve during the Middle French period (14th to 17th centuries) and then the Modern French period, which began in the 17th century and continues to the present day. Modern French is characterized by its sophisticated grammar, extensive vocabulary, and standardized pronunciation rules. The French writing system uses the Latin alphabet, with 26 letters and additional accented forms for vowels (é, è, ê, ë, etc.). It also employs several ligatures, such as œ and æ. French is known for its relatively complex grammar, with grammatical gender (masculine and feminine), noun and adjective agreement, and verb conjugations. French has had a significant impact on other languages around the world, particularly in the areas of science, art, literature, and diplomacy.

On June 23, 1996, during the World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) King of the Ring event, Stone Cold Steve Austin (real name Steven James Anderson) was set to face Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts in the tournament final. Before the match, Roberts had cut a promo (pre-match promotional speech) quoting the Bible, specifically referencing the passage John 3:16. After Austin's victory over Roberts, in his post-match promo, Stone Cold responded to Roberts' earlier words by stating, \\"You sit there and you thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn't get you anywhere. Talk about your Psalms, talk about John 3:16... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!\\" This moment marked the birth of the \\"Austin 3:16\\" catchphrase, which resonated with WWE fans and became a major part of his persona during the peak of his career. Thus, the meaning of Austin's 3:16 is a direct retort to the biblical John 3:16, signifying Stone Cold's rebellious and anti-establishment character. Stone Cold Steve Austin is often associated with drinking beer, as he would regularly celebrate victories by chugging beers in the ring. The brand of beer he typically drank during these post-match celebrations is called \\"Steveweiser.\\" Steveweiser is not a real beer, but a renamed, prop version of Budweiser supplied by WWF for Steve Austin's on-screen persona. However, in real life, Austin enjoys a variety of beer brands, and he has even created his own craft beer called the \\"Broken Skull IPA\\" in collaboration with El Segundo Brewing Company.

Grande dame of cooking still going strong at 90: Julia Child celebrates in San Francisco. How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home.

After this initial experience, Thomson and another colleague, William Broadhead, went on a two-month expedition, going up the Spanish River and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today Mississagi Provincial Park). Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his own original style of painting became apparent around this time. Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, was lost during two canoe spills; the first was on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids.In fall 1912, Albert Robson, Grip's art director, moved to the design firm Rous & Mann. A month after returning to Toronto, Thomson followed Robson and left Grip to join Rous & Mann too. They were soon joined by Varley, Carmichael and Lismer. Robson later spoke favourably of Thomson's loyalty, calling him \\"a most diligent, reliable and capable craftsman\\". Robson's success in attracting great talent was well understood. Employee Leonard Rossell believed that the key to Robson's success \\"was that the artists felt that he was interested in them personally and did all he could to further their progress. Those who worked there were all allowed time off to pursue their studies ... Tom Thomson, so far as I know, never took definite lessons from anyone, yet he progressed quicker than any of us.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Grace Beverly Jones (born 19 May 1948) is a Jamaican singer, songwriter, supermodel, record producer, and actress. Born in Jamaica, she moved when she was 13, along with her siblings, to live with her parents in Syracuse, New York. Jones began her modelling career in New York state, then in Paris, working for fashion houses such as Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo, and appearing on the covers of Elle and Vogue. She worked with photographers such as Jean-Paul Goude, Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer, and became known for her distinctive androgynous appearance and bold features. Context: Grace Jones was born in 1948 (though most sources say 1952) in Spanish Town, Jamaica, the daughter of Marjorie (nee Williams) and Robert W. Jones, who was a local politician and Apostolic clergyman. The couple already had two children, and would go on to have four more. Robert and Marjorie moved to the East Coast of the United States, where Robert worked as an agricultural labourer until a spiritual experience during a failed suicide attempt inspired him to become a Pentecostal minister. While they were in the US, they left their children with Marjorie's mother and her new husband, Peart. Jones knew him as \\"Mas P\\" ('Master P') and later noted that she \\"absolutely hated him\\"; as a strict disciplinarian he regularly beat the children in his care, representing what Jones described as \\"serious abuse\\". She was raised into the family's Pentecostal faith, having to take part in prayer meetings and Bible readings every night. She initially attended the Pentecostal All Saints School, before being sent to a nearby public school. As a child, shy Jones had only one schoolfriend and was teased by classmates for her \\"skinny frame\\", but she excelled at sports and found solace in the nature of Jamaica. Marjorie and Robert eventually brought their children - including the 13 year old Grace - to live with them in the US, where they had settled in Lyncourt, Salina, New York, near Syracuse. It was in the city that her father had established his own ministry, the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ, in 1956. Jones continued her schooling and after she graduated, enrolled at Onondaga Community College majoring in Spanish. Jones began to rebel against her parents and their religion; she began wearing makeup, drinking alcohol, and visiting gay clubs with her brother. At college, she also took a theatre class, with her drama teacher convincing her to join him on a summer stock tour in Philadelphia. Arriving in the city, she decided to stay there, immersing herself in the Counterculture of the 1960s by living in hippie communes, earning money as a go-go dancer, and using LSD and other drugs. She later praised the use of LSD as \\"a very important part of my emotional growth... The mental exercise was good for me\\". She moved back to New York at 18 and signed on as a model with Wilhelmina Modelling agency. She moved to Paris in 1970. The Parisian fashion scene was receptive to Jones' unusual, androgynous, bold, dark-skinned appearance. Yves St. Laurent, Claude Montana, and Kenzo Takada hired her for runway modelling, and she appeared on the covers of Elle, Vogue, and Stern working with Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer. Jones also modelled for Azzedine Alaia, and was frequently photographed promoting his line. While modelling in Paris, she shared an apartment with Jerry Hall and Jessica Lange. Hall and Jones frequented Le Sept, one of Paris's most popular gay clubs of the 1970s and '80s, and socialised with Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld. In 1973, Jones appeared on the cover of a reissue of Billy Paul's 1970 album Ebony Woman. Question: Who were her parents?

Here is an article: WASHINGTON, June 4  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice played down today a threat from Tehran to curb oil exports if the United States made \\"a single mistake about Iran,\\" but added that Iranian leaders had a limited window for taking up a six-nation offer of incentives if they stop enriching uranium. \\"We shouldn't place too much emphasis on a threat of this kind,\\" Rice said on \\"Fox News Sunday,\\" referring to comments today by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader. \\"I think something like 80 percent of Iran's budget comes from oil revenue, and so obviously it would be a very serious problem for Iran if oil were disrupted.\\" Iran had previously avoided using oil as a threat in the standoff over its nuclear program, a confrontation that has grown in urgency since it resumed enrichment activities late last year, in defiance of pleas from the United Nations, the Europeans and the United States. The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  Britain, France, Russia, China and the United States  joined by Germany, said last week that they would formally present Iran an offer of substantial incentives  including, in a shift, possible American participation in multilateral talks  should Iran suspend enrichment as part of a program that the six countries fear could lead to a nuclear weapon. The Iranian response so far has been largely defiant, although President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran said Saturday that Tehran would not prejudge the proposal. But Ayatollah Khamenei appeared more peremptory today, saying that Iran would not give in to \\"threats and bribes,\\" and calling it \\"an absurd lie\\" that Iran sought nuclear bombs. He declared friendship with Europe, but, in reference to the United States, said, \\"If you make a single mistake about Iran, the supply of energy will definitely be put in serious risk.\\" And Mr. Amadinejad said Iran would reveal details of the proposed incentives and threatened penalties  details expected to be formally delivered within days by Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief  thereby rejecting a United Nations plea for diplomatic confidentiality. The Iranian president insisted that his country's \\"right to nuclear technology and power is legal and definite, and we will not talk about these issues.\\" He expressed a willingness, however, to discuss \\"the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and how to stop it.\\" Ms. Rice reiterated today that Iran had a right to a civil nuclear program, but said that \\"you don't want the negotiations to be used as a cover for continued progress along the nuclear front.\\" She declined to reveal details of the six-nation offer, saying, \\"The Iranians shouldn't have to read in the newspaper what is being offered to them.\\" But while saying that Tehran would need some time to assess the offer, she added, \\"We will not allow Iran to drag this out.\\" Ms. Rice declined to announce any deadline, but said the six nations agreed that \\"we really do have to have this settled over a matter of weeks, not months.\\" Ms. Rice helped engineer a policy shift by Washington last week that would allow it to join in the talks with Tehran, conducted up to now by Britain, France and Germany. She was said to fear that the international coalition on Iran was close to collapse. China and Russia had appeared increasingly resistant to calls from the United States and others to impose sanctions if Iran continued its enrichment activities. Ms. Rice would not say explicitly today that Russia and China had agreed to impose sanctions if Iran rejected the latest offer, but she said on Fox News that \\"we are absolutely satisfied with the commitments of our allies to a robust path.\\" President Bush has spoken by phone or in person to the leaders of the five other countries, and Ms. Rice met with counterparts from those countries last week in Vienna. She said today that Iran would be confronted with one package of incentives and another of tougher measures. Ms. Rice said that Washington's partners were \\"committed to robust action on either path, as appropriate,\\" but that diplomacy was the strong preference. \\"The important thing,\\" Ms. Rice said on Fox News, \\"is here it's a major opportunity, a sort of major crossroads for Iran.\\" In a separate appearance on the CBS News program \\"Face the Nation,\\" Ms. Rice said, \\"We need to know whether negotiation is a real option or not, and we will soon know that.\\" Ms. Rice also called for patience in dealing with the new Iraqi government, despite its inability to settle on new interior and defense ministers at a time of sharply resurgent violence and intense sectarian conflict. \\"Obviously, this is a very tough process,\\" she said. But, Ms. Rice added, \\"to have a government of national unity is at the core of solving the problems.\\" Ms. Rice was asked about the incident on Nov. 19 in the Iraqi city of Haditha in which a marine unit is accused of entering several houses and killing up to 24 civilians, including women and children. \\"I can assure you that the investigation will be thorough,\\" she said, adding that if appropriate, people would be punished. Asked about recent comments by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq that attacks on civilian targets by some in the multinational forces had become common  with some troops even killing \\"on a suspicion or a hunch\\"  Ms. Rice simply said Mr. Maliki was a strong supporter of the American-led coalition and had consistently worked closely with its officials.

Step 2: Identifying the core message The premise states that the actual government subsidy per job is 323,000, and the job pay is 50,000. The hypothesis states that the subsidy is 20,000 per job, resulting in more than 200,000 profit per job.

Entailment means that if the premise is true, the hypothesis should also be true. In this case, we should verify whether the premise's information leads to the hypothesis's conclusion about the subsidy amount and profit per job. Step 4: Examining the entailment Based on the premise, the government provides a subsidy of 323,000 per job, and the jobs pay 50,000. There is no information provided about the profits. In the hypothesis, the government subsidy is stated as 20,000 per job, leading to more than 200,000 in profit per job.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Moon craters may hold ancient asteroid pieces NASA / Goddard Space Flight Center / Arizona State University Sunrise shadows on the moon's Tycho crater, as seen by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter on June 10, 2011. Twenty-five percent of the moon's impact craters may retain substantial remnants of the asteroids that created them, a new study finds. The surprising result suggests that scientists will have to work a little harder than they had perhaps anticipated to figure out what the moon is made of, researchers said. \\"Future studies of the moon's composition will have to show that exposed surface rocks really come from the moon and were not delivered by impacts, especially for unusual or exotic minerals,\\" said co-author Jay Melosh of Purdue University. [10 Surprising Moon Facts] Melosh and his colleagues, led by Zhong Yue of Purdue and the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Remote Sensing Applications in Beijing, used computer models to simulate the formation of lunar craters by asteroid impacts. They determined thatone-quarter of space rock strikes on the moon likely occur at a velocity of 26,800 mph (43,130 km/h) or less — blazingly fast, to be sure, but not fast enough to obliterate the asteroid. Other simulations performed by the team show that, at such impact speeds, little asteroid material is vaporized and lots of it is hurled against the walls of the newly formed crater. If the crater is at least 12 miles (20 kilometers) or so wide, impactor remnants tend to accumulate in a central peak as the crater collapses under the moon's gravity. The findings of the new study, which was published online Friday in the journal Nature Geoscience, could explain the occurrence of minerals called spinels and olivines in the central peaks of large lunar craters such as the 58-mile-wide (93 km) Copernicus. Spinels and olivines are common in many asteroids, so it's possible that these and other minerals that scientists had assumed were indigenous to the moon were actually delivered via space rock strikes, researchers said. \\"We cannot infer the deep composition of the moon from rocks in the centers of large craters without more care than has been used to date,\\" Melosh told Space.com via email. The findings have other intriguing ramifications as well. Some material blasted off Earth by colossal impacts long ago, after all, is thought to have hit the moon at relatively slow velocities. \\"This raises the possibility of finding early Earth material, ejected by collisions billions of years ago, in massive deposits on the moon, and suggests yet another explanation for the spinels: that they are deposits derived from the Earth’s upper mantle, emplaced long ago on to the moon and reworked,\\" Erik Asphaug of Arizona State University writes in an accompanying commentary in the same issue of Nature Geoscience. \\"Even more provocative is the suggestion that we might someday find Earth’s protobiological materials, no longer available on our geologically active and repeatedly recycled planet, in dry storage up in the lunar 'attic,'\\" Asphaug adds.

News article: Belle and Sebastian invite devotees to dance at HOB When the Scottish outfit Belle and Sebastian emerged in the late ’90s, its precisely arranged, plainly emotive brand of pop was seized upon fiercely by listeners looking to commemorate their heartbreaks and other hiccups in song. Tracks like the plaintive “The Fox in the Snow” and the achingly hopeful “Judy and the Dream of Horses” captured the imagination of twee: a subset of indie rock that sounds like it perpetually exists in the first flushes of romance. That sugar-rush appeal has earned Belle and Sebastian a devoted (and growing) cult, which communes on college radio stations and online message boards. The band’s packed show at House of Blues on Monday night felt at times like a meeting of that secret society. An impeccable live act, Belle and Sebastian over the course of 20 years has loosened up just enough to share in-jokes with its rapturous audience. During Monday’s show, the start of a North American tour supporting the recent LP “Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance,” band members offered sly asides about back-in-the-day Boston gigs and the vagaries of aging, between tales of sex, heartbreak, and dancing. The songs, from the space-age “Electronic Renaissance” to the envious “Perfect Couples,” remained sterling in their precision, although that meticulousness is obscured just enough by the heart-on-sleeve lyrics and slightly fuzzy guitars that are twee’s hallmarks. The band’s combination of emotion and the kind of devotion to pure pop craftsmanship exhibited by makers of beautiful music from Henry Mancini to Jeff Lynne is unparalleled, in both its musical and lyrical execution. The swooping strings on “The Power of Three” and rave-up percussion on “Legal Man” could have doubled for bursting hearts. Just before “Legal Man,” the band invited fans onstage to dance to the jaunty, saucy “The Boy With the Arab Strap,” and a healthy clutch took them up on the offer. One dancer lingered after the rest had left, prompting frontman Stuart Murdoch to dub him the band’s official butler for the rest of the tour. The encore was muted at first, at Murdoch’s request. But it provided another moment for communion: a cover of Simon & Garfunkel’s “America,” meant to send the band off on its cross-continental trek, inspired singalongs, and allowed for just enough of a breath to be taken before “Judy and the Dream of Horses” — the appropriately bittersweet choice for the night’s last dance.

Successfultreatmentofanorexia/VitaViva-Info Please segment the words:","completion":"Successful treatment of anorexia / Vita Viva-Info Anorexia nervosa is a complex mental health disorder characterized by a distorted body image, persistent fear and obsession with being overweight, restrictive eating behaviors, and a relentless pursuit of thinness, even at the expense of health, happiness, and safety. Successful treatment of anorexia is a multi-faceted approach that often involves a team of healthcare professionals, including psychologists, therapists, dietitians, and sometimes medical doctors. It is critical to recognize that treating anorexia nervosa is a long-term commitment and requires an individualized approach. Everyone's experience and needs are unique. Here are some key components for successful treatment of anorexia: 1. Early diagnosis and intervention: The sooner a person is diagnosed with anorexia, the better the chances of successful treatment. Early intervention can minimize physical and psychological complications, as well as prevent long-term damage to the body and mind. 2. Medical assessment and management: A healthcare professional should perform a thorough medical evaluation to identify and address any co-occurring medical conditions or complications related to anorexia. 3. Psychological therapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), family-based therapy, or other specialized forms of treatment are essential components of any anorexia treatment plan. These therapies help patients address the root issues behind their disordered eating and develop healthier thought patterns and coping mechanisms. 4. Nutritional counseling: A registered dietitian plays an important role in helping individuals with anorexia restore a healthy relationship with food and develop proper eating habits. This often includes providing meal plans, monitoring progress, and offering guidance about appropriate dietary intake. 5. Support from family and friends: A strong support network can help make recovery more feasible and sustainable. Involving loved ones in therapy sessions can provide additional support and ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding the individual’s treatment plan. 6. Ongoing monitoring and adjustments: Anorexia is a chronic condition that may require long-term care. Regular check-ins with healthcare providers can help identify and address any roadblocks, setbacks, or concerns that arise during the recovery process. 7. Relapse prevention: Developing a plan to prevent relapses is a crucial aspect of long-term recovery from anorexia. Coping strategies, such as having a support network, maintaining regular therapy sessions, and staying vigilant for any warning signs of relapse, can help maintain progress. Vita Viva-Info is presumably an information resource platform that may provide additional resources and support for those dealing with anorexia. However, it is advisable to consult with healthcare professionals, as they can offer personalized guidance and treatment plans tailored to the individual's specific needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness is assigned to stop Capone, but his first attempt at a liquor raid fails due to corrupt policemen tipping Capone off. He has a chance meeting with Irish-American veteran officer Jimmy Malone, who is fed up with the rampant corruption and offers to help Ness, suggesting that they find a man from the police academy who has not come under Capone's influence. They recruit Italian-American trainee George Stone (aka-Giuseppe Petri) for his superior marksmanship and intelligence. Joined by accountant Oscar Wallace, assigned to Ness from Washington, D.C., they conduct a successful raid on a Capone liquor cache and start to gain positive publicity, with the press dubbing them \\"The Untouchables.\\" Capone later kills the henchman in charge of the cache as a warning to his other men. Wallace discovers that Capone has not filed an income tax return for some years and suggests that the team try to build a tax evasion case against him, since he is well-insulated from his other crimes. An alderman offers Ness a bribe to drop his investigation, but Ness angrily refuses it and throws him out of the office. When Capone gunman Frank Nitti threatens Ness' family, Ness has his wife and daughter moved to a safe house. His team flies to the CanadaâUnited States border to intercept an incoming liquor shipment, aided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, killing several gangsters and capturing George, a Capone bookkeeper. Malone shoots a gangster through the mouth (not revealing the man is already dead) to scare George into agreeing to testify against Capone. Wallace prepares to escort George from the Chicago police station to a safe house, but they are shot and killed by Nitti, who has infiltrated the station.

Make sure the squares are large enough to cover the Ferrero Rocher candies. Step 3: Gluing candies to tissue paper squares - Place a Ferrero Rocher candy in the center of each tissue paper square. - Apply a generous amount of glue on the bottom side of the candy. Make sure to use a glue that will stick well to both the chocolate wrapper and the tissue paper. - Press the candy onto the tissue paper square so it firmly sticks to the center. - Repeat this process for all candies and tissue paper squares. Allow enough time for the glue to dry completely. Step 4: Attach decorated tissue squares to the wine bottle - Apply a small amount of glue to the back of each tissue paper square, focusing on the outer edges. - Starting at the bottom of the wine bottle, press the tissue paper square with the glued candy onto the wine bottle. Ensure it adheres properly. - Continue attaching the tissue-paper-covered candies to the wine bottle by working your way up from the bottom. Arrange the squares in a pattern or design of your choice, making sure they cover the entire surface of the wine bottle. - Let the glue dry completely before handling or displaying the decorative wine bottle. This approach makes sense as it ensures that the candies are firmly attached to the tissue paper squares first, providing a better surface for gluing them to the wine bottle."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The electromagnetic field obeys laws of motion similarly to a mass on a spring, and can come to thermal equilibrium with hot atoms. The hot object in equilibrium with light absorbs just as much light as it emits. If the object is black, meaning it absorbs all the light that hits it, then its thermal light emission is maximized.

This property of a black object makes it an ideal candidate to study the behavior of objects at different temperatures and the subsequent radiation that they emit. In fact, under thermal equilibrium conditions, a black object will emit the maximum possible amount of thermal light emission, which is governed by the temperature of the object and the frequency of the emitted light, as described by Planck's law of black-body radiation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"To answer your questions, I will break them down into relevant parts and provide explanations step-by-step. 1. What is the difference between keyPress, keyUp, and keyDown events? Step 1: Define keyPress, keyUp, and keyDown events separately: - keyPress: This event is triggered when a keyboard key is pressed and produces a character value. - keyDown: This event is triggered when a keyboard key is first pressed down. - keyUp: This event is triggered when a keyboard key is released after being pressed. Step 2: Compare the differences: - keyPress is specifically for character keys and triggers when they're pressed, while keyDown and keyUp can be used for all types of keys (such as Ctrl, Alt, Shift, etc.). - keyDown corresponds to the starting phase of the key press, keyPress occurs during, and keyUp indicates the key has been released. 2. What is the difference between an object and an event? Step 1: Define an object and an event: - Object: An instance of a class in programming, representing a combination of data and methods that can manipulate that data. - Event: An action or occurrence detected by a program, usually triggered by user input, such as clicking, typing, or scrolling. Step 2: Compare the differences: - Objects are data structures with associated methods, while events are occurrences or actions that can be detected and handled by code. - Objects can be thought of as \\"things\\" in your code, while events represent \\"happenings\\" or \\"occurrences\\" that interact with your code. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? Answer: (1). no Justification: The first question is about understanding the differences between keyPress, keyUp, and keyDown events, while the second question asks about differences between objects and events.

[ii] it is not possible to tell. [iii] no.","completion":"[ii] it is not possible to tell. The premise \\"Don't underestimate newcomers to the ring\\" suggests that you should not downplay the abilities and skills of those who are new to a competitive environment, as they may have potential you have not yet seen or identified. The premise acknowledges that newcomers have the ability to perform well and make a difference, despite their lack of experience in such a setting. However, whether or not the hypothesis \\"Don't underestimate the veterans of the ring\\" is true cannot be directly concluded from this premise alone. The two statements address different groups of people – newcomers and veterans – highlighting the need to be conscious of both of their varying abilities. It's conceivable that veterans could also be underestimated, especially if they have been participating for a long time and people may not value their experience as much anymore. Conversely, there may be reasons why veterans could more reasonably be underestimated, such as a decline in performance due to aging or injury. In order to determine the validity of the hypothesis \\"Don't underestimate the veterans of the ring,\\" additional evidence, context, or premises would need to be considered. Given the information provided, it isn't possible to definitively support or refute the hypothesis. Both statements promote a sentiment of caution against making assumptions about people based on their level of experience, but they address separate groups, and conclusions about one group cannot necessarily be derived from those about the other.

Plot title: The Contractor Movie plot: Retired CIA black-ops hitman James Jackson Dial (Wesley Snipes) is living his life in seclusion on his ranch in Montana when he is offered the chance to redeem himself by his former employer, Jeremy Collins (Ralph Brown). Some years earlier, Dial had been seconds away from taking down notorious terrorist cell leader Ali Mahmoud Jahar (Nikolay Sotirov) but his carelessness allowed Jahar to escape, marking his assignment as a failure. Now Collins wants Dial to complete his task by assassinating Jahar, who has been captured and is now in the custody of the police in London, England. Provided with a safe house, passports, and an assistant, Terry Winchell (Richard Harrington), Dial is off to London to complete unfinished business. Disguised as a priest, Dial gets into position in a church bell tower across the street from the building that Jahar is being brought into. When Jahar is brought out of the police van, his head is covered by a jacket, leaving Dial without a clean shot. Not wanting to fail again, Dial patiently waits for his opportunity. Moments later, from his high vantage point, Dial spots Jahar standing inside the building with his back to the window. Dial grasps the opportunity and shoots through the glass, fatally hitting Jahar in back of his head. Because of the delay caused by a pair of cops, Winchell is late in bringing the getaway car, and this brings attention to them fleeing the scene. After numerous attempts to stop the car, the police open fire, killing Winchell. The car, now out of control, comes to crashing stop, injuring Dial. But Dial manages to get out of the crashed car. On the run and bleeding profusely, he makes his way to the safe house, where he meets curious 12-year-old neighbor Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who lives with her grandmother (Gemma Jones). Emily helps Dial stop the bleeding.

My question: What rules are at play? Answer:","completion":"The rules at play in the movie plot \\"The Contractor\\" involve professional ethics, moral dilemmas, trust, and the concept of redemption: 1. Professional Ethics: As a CIA black-ops hitman, Dial is expected to follow strict professional guidelines and complete his assignments efficiently and discreetly. His previous failure to take down Jahar reflects a lapse in his professional ethics. Dial's decision to accept the new assignment and finish the task signifies his want to correct this and adhere to the standards expected of him. 2. Moral Dilemmas: Dial faces a moral dilemma regarding the taking of a human life. He disguises himself as a priest - a symbol of faith, morality, and forgiveness - in order to carry out an assassination. This juxtaposition of roles showcases the conflict between his sense of duty to eliminate a terrorist and the moral implications of causing death. 3. Trust: Trust plays a significant role between various characters in the movie plot. Dial trusts his former employer Collins by accepting the mission, and Winchell, his assistant, exhibits trust in Dial by aiding him in the assignment. Additionally, Dial begins to develop trust with his 12-year-old neighbor Emily as she helps him recover from his injuries and becomes involved in his predicament. 4. Redemption: Dial is offered a chance to redeem himself by completing the failed task and assassinate Jahar. His desire to make amends for his past failure drives him to complete the mission even when faced with obstacles and danger. However, with the security footage of Dial's escape making his assignment a failure in Collins' eyes, the theme of redemption becomes uncertain, leaving the audience to question whether Dial will achieve a personal and professional sense of redemption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Down a quiet street in the New Orleans Square section of Disneyland, far from the mouse-riddled streets of Downtown Disney, sits a secret clubhouse. This is no offshoot of the famed Mickey Mouse Club, though, nor is it a place to spot princesses eating breakfast. Instead, it’s an ultra-exclusive restaurant and bar for the Disneyland elite, possible investors, visiting dignitaries, and, of course, celebrities. Club 33 is a meeting place for the rumored 500 members willing to pony up 25,000 for membership fees, plus 12,000 a year in dues for the privilege of eating and drinking in the shadow of Sleeping Beauty�?s Castle. The speakeasy is not a new addition to the park. In fact, it was developed by Walt Disney himself and decorated with antiques and a French elevator chosen by Disney and his wife. Disney envisioned Club 33 as a place for VIPs to meet and greet far from the maddening crowds of Main Street U.S.A. The club officially opened in 1967, five months after Disney’s death, and has been hosting the Disneyland one percent ever since. While Disneyland has some big changes planned for the years to come, it’s unlikely that Club 33 is going anywhere. The concept has even spread from California to Japan, with a sister location in Tokyo Disneyland. Tim Rue According to fan site Disney Dose, which managed to score an invitation, Club 33 is lavishly decorated, filled with lush furniture, chandeliers, stained glass, and dark wood. There’s also a harpsichord that’s been played by both Paul McCartney and Elton John, according to the website Vine Pair. There’s a courtyard called the Court of Angels, an extensive wine cellar, a jazz club lounge featuring a hand-carved wood bar, and a main dining room serving a French Nouveau menu that includes items like sassafras-dusted duck breast, butter poached lobster, and flaming vanilla crème brulee (at least at the time that Disney Dose went for a visit). While the prix-fixe meal costs 100 per person, unlimited dessert is reportedly included, proving that the restaurant could be the happiest place inside the Happiest Place on Earth. Because this is a Disney property, there are nods to the Magic Kingdom throughout, including a talking vulture perched on a grandfather clock in the reception area, original Disney artist drawings, and fanciful fairytale-filled artwork. Unfortunately, most people will never be able to see the inside of the club. The membership is limited—rumored to have a waiting list with more than 800 names. While in past years, members had passes to share with friends, in 2015, Disneyland changed the Club 33 policy last year, and now only the member and a spouse or domestic partner can access the club benefits. Luckily, it’s possible to take a tour on YouTube and through fan photos. ||||| Questions and rumors about Shanghai Disneyland abound. As Disney’s newest theme park prepares for its debut June 16, 2016 there are so many questions still unanswered. I was privileged to preview SH Disneyland in May during Trial Operations, and was truly impressed with the scope of this park (even after seeing all the other Disney castles). Opening with five noteworthy E-ticket attractions and three stage shows, SH Disneyland is poised to be a key player among Disney parks. Here, I answer 10 essential questions about Shanghai Disneyland. 1. Why is there no Main Street USA? When is the next Train? Shanghai Disneyland is distinguished by many record “firsts.” First Disneyland without Main Street USA. First Disneyland without a train. (Yes, in this spacious park, the train station was built only as a nod to tradition). First to substitute Tron for Space Mountain. And that castle! The local population in China has not had the same exposure to Disney characters that the Western world has. Many Disney films were never released in China. Chinese guests know Mickey and Minnie. They adore Winnie the Pooh for being cute, cuddly, and red and gold (popular Chinese colors). They love Anna and Elsa. Other characters may all be new to the locals. Mickey Avenue was built to introduce Disney characters. Initially themed as an ‘international street,’ Mickey Avenue incorporates harmonious influences from France (Remy’s Patisserie) and Italy (Il Paperino gelateria). Whimsical is the rule, reminiscent of Toon Town. The Bank – resembling a giant vault – belongs to Scrooge McDuck. Minnie signs autographs at Sweethearts Confectionery. Pluto greets guests where the flag pole would usually be. As you enter Mickey Avenue, shopping is on the left (Avenue M Arcade replaces the Emporium). Food is on the right – Remy’s, the Confectionery, and Chip & Dale’s Treehouse Treats. Many storefronts line the street, but not all are actual shops. (Contrary to the signage, there is no Barber Shop). Windows above the shops have potential room for future honorees. 2. Whose Castle is this? Towering above the skyline, SH Disneyland’s Enchanted Storybook Castle is immediately new, yet familiar. Sleeping Beauty inspired Disney castles in Anaheim, Paris, and Hong Kong. Cinderella constructed large castles in Orlando and Tokyo. So whose castle is this? SH Disneyland built this castle as a tribute to all the Princesses. It is as impressive as it is massive. Graceful spires and towers built in varied architectural styles stretch skyward to honor different Disney Princesses. The weather vane on top points towards Anaheim, and the original Disneyland. As you circle around, you notice that the Castle changes from each vantage point. Wooden accents. Balconies. Gargoyles. Forest animals. Seashells. External stairs and a sky bridge. A lofty central hall recreates the magical ballroom scene from Beauty and the Beast, complete with chandelier and stars set against a cobalt blue sky. Four mosaic murals sparkle along the inner walls, featuring Rapunzel, Merida, Tiana, and Anna and Elsa. The Castle is home to the “Once Upon a Time” Adventure – a Snow White walk through attraction. Royal Banquet Hall, the park’s only table-service restaurant, features character dining with Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Daisy on the second floor (ADA accessible by elevator). Of course, there’s a Princess meet and greet at Storybook Court. The SH Disneyland castle is the first one extensive enough to include a boat ride attraction: Voyage to the Crystal Grotto (think Jungle Cruise, fairytale-style, with top-notch special effects in the Grotto). 3. What are Gardens of Imagination? Gardens of Imagination form a new Land in the hub of SH Disneyland. Filled with peaceful reflective waterways and mismatched bridges, these Gardens lead you to an ideal photo opportunity with Storyteller Walt and Mickey. Notably, this is the first time Dumbo and the Fantasia-themed Carousel are located in front of the Castle. To the right, the Garden of the Twelve Friends is composed of mosaic murals featuring animals of the Chinese Zodiac, Disney style: Tiger (Tigger), Dragon (Mushu), Rabbit (Thumper), Rat (Remy), Snake (Kaa), Pig (Hamm), Horse (Maximus), Dog (Pluto), Monkey (Abu), Rooster (Allan-A-Dale), Cow (Babe the Blue Ox), and Sheep (Jolly Holiday Lambs). 4. Can I get a Turkey Leg? Where’s the Coke? Yes! Turkey legs and churros are available on food carts. I saw popcorn in butter and caramel flavors. (Tokyo DL has at least 5 different flavors of popcorn – including curry, soy sauce, and honey – differentiated by exclusive cart locations on the map). There are many quick-service restaurants and food stands serving mostly Asian fare, ranging from dim sum and noodles to bakery goods. I did not see any flattened Korean Squid in Shanghai (popular at Hong Kong Disneyland food carts). Coke lovers, be prepared. In a surprising break from tradition, Pepsi is a sponsor of Shanghai Disneyland. Coke is served at all other Disney parks around the world. 5. Can I make reservations for the Blue Bayou? Captain Barbossa commandeered the Blue Bayou at SH Disneyland, now a Quick Service restaurant called Barbossa’s Bounty. Walking into an expansive hall, you choose from several food bays (each with a different menu). Gathering your meal – served on pirate compass-themed plates – you wander through a pirate’s lair. Portraits of Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swan, and Angelica (Penelope Cruz) garnish the walls. Each dining chamber is designed with true pirate flair. You almost expect them to reappear, as they’ve just briefly stepped away. You pass rooms dedicated to women pirates, and Royal British Naval officers of Jerry Bruckheimer’s Pirates films. You finally settle down at the iconic waterfront table seating. Adjacent is a remarkable rum cellar, stacked to the ceiling with barrels and barrels of rum. 6. Are there Fastpasses for Soaring? Yes! Martin Short will be glad to know that Soaring Over the Horizon has Fastpasses. Be sure to plan for this one early as the Standby line for Soaring reached 6 hours during Trial Operations. It’s important to note that Fastpasses are distributed at Guest Relations booths in the Land where the ride is located. FastPass machines are not near the actual attraction. Guest Relations booths in each Land are marked with an “i” symbol (next to the “FP” symbol) on the park map. Tip: The Disney Fastpass system is available for: TRON Lightcycle Power Run, Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Peter Pan’s Flight, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, Soaring Over the Horizon, and Roaring Rapids. Fastpass is not available for Pirates of the Caribbean – Battle for the Sunken Treasure, or Voyage to the Crystal Grotto. 7. Why is there no Haunted Mansion? Chinese historically have been very superstitious, and they are not fond of ghosts or hauntings. Hong Kong Disneyland did not open with a Haunted Mansion. Instead, GPS-guided Mystic Manor was added later. Mystic Manor is more whimsical and hints at the supernatural, rather than dead ghosts. Similarly, Shanghai DL has not invited the 999 Happy Haunts to their park. 8. Who stole the toilet? Restrooms. This topic isn’t often discussed, but is very important. It’s a bit of a culture shock if you aren’t prepared. Squat toilets (a ceramic toilet pan in the ground) have been traditional for Asian populations for centuries. While still used occasionally in Japan, squat toilets are standardly used in China. The squat toilets at SH Disneyland are easily spotted: 1) they are the first ones you see coming in, and 2) there are two small steps leading up to the stall. Restrooms are approximately 80% squat toilets, and 20% ‘Western’ toilets (what we’re used to). Tip: If you see 2 small steps, keep walking. Traditional Western toilets are on level ground, and sometimes marked with the handicap symbol on the stalls. 9. Is there a Club 33? Yes, there will be. Club 33 is situated above Mickey Avenue. The entry is down a small walkway on the left side, between Il Paperino and Avenue M Arcade. The walls around the entry are painted with an Eyvind Earl-style Sleeping Beauty mural. Painted street numbers appear natural to the casual observer – 31, 32… 33. 10. Can I get Mickey ears with my Chinese name embroidered on them? Yes, and no. Actually, unless you were born with one, you don’t really have a Chinese name. Cast members can match your English name to the approximate sounds of Chinese characters – hopefully with a pleasant meaning. That becomes your ‘Chinese name.’ Many people, including famous Hollywood actors, have names created in Chinese that sound similar to their English names. Mickey and Minnie ears are available on Mickey Avenue. What are you most excited to see at Shanghai Disneyland? What burning questions do you have? I’d love to answer them. Please share your comments with me @ChrysalisTravel ||||| Opening its 5.5-billion resort in mainland China this week, Walt Disney Co. has been eager to share all manner of details about its Shanghai theme park — down to how many bok choy it expects to serve in the first year of operation (12 million, if you’re wondering). But one thing Disney reps have not been keen to discuss is whether the resort has a Club 33, the members-only establishment for well-heeled and well-connected fans of the Mouse House. Design documents for the theme park posted online three years ago revealed that significant elements of Chinese culture were being incorporated. The documents also posited a less-than-egalitarian Club 33 would be located in the Shanghai resort, which is operated by a joint venture in which Disney holds a 43% stake and the state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group owns the rest. Rain doesn't dampen the mood of opening day at Shanghai Disney » Still, evidence was scant until this week, when the park formally opened its doors to the public on Thursday. One morsel came courtesy of Michael Chase, a senior project manager with Walt Disney Imagineering who designed the Walt Disney Grand Theatre in the Disneytown shopping district, where a Mandarin version of the Disney Broadway show “The Lion King” debuted on Tuesday evening. On June 8, Chase posted a photo on Instagram tagged with the location “Club 33 Shanghai Disneyland” and showing a white-linen-covered table with a flower centerpiece and a leather-bound menu with the number 33 on it. A link to the post on Twitter said, “Just a hint at where I had dinner last night. #club33 #shanghaidisneyland.” https://www.instagram.com/p/BGXjFHiLtTu/?taken-by=michaelchase971 More confirmation came from no less than Willow Bay, director of the Annenberg School of Journalism at USC (and wife of Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger). Asked Friday via Twitter whether a photo she took of the park’s opening moments was shot from Club 33 above Mickey Avenue near the entrance gates, she replied: “yes, it sure is.” Bay did not respond to follow-up messages. A Disney spokeswoman did not reply to multiple requests for comment on Friday. https://twitter.com/Willow_Bay/status/743309661324009472 https://twitter.com/Willow_Bay/status/743664655931826176 An arched doorway with the address 33 and flanked by painted trees apparently is one entry to the exclusive club, located just west of Mickey Avenue and facing the Enchanted Storybook Castle and Gardens of Imagination. After Thursday morning’s ribbon-cutting ceremony, a number of VIP guests made their way to that doorway but were told by staff that they could not enter and were diverted to another venue. https://twitter.com/JulieMakLAT/status/743249981696442370 Eagle-eyed visitors to the adjacent Disneytown shopping district have spotted another doorway marked with a simple “33,” indicating the club is accessible from both inside and outside the theme park gates. The original Club 33 opened at Disneyland in 1967, six months after Walt Disney’s death. The impresario had envisioned Club 33 as a private place to entertain investors and business associates. The limited membership, said to number just 500 at Disneyland, has only added to the club’s mystique. The club's annual dues, said to run 12,000 a year, entitle members to park admission, exclusive benefits and access to the only alcohol regularly served at Disneyland. Another Club 33 operates at Tokyo Disneyland, and a members-only club called 1901 (the year of Walt’s birth) operates at Anaheim’s California Adventure park.

Video: A flyover view of Shanghai Disney Here's what you can eat at Shanghai Disney ||||| A former member of Disneyland’s private Club 33 said his membership was revoked after a friend auctioned off a guest pass for a children’s charity. But Disney officials say Joseph Cosgrove had misused his membership for years leading up to the latest incident. Mark Corrinet, an attorney representing Cosgrove, 84, of Lake Forest, filed a lawsuit against The Walt Disney Co. this week in Los Angeles Superior Court charging breach of contract and other allegations after Disney’s private club terminated his client’s membership after 47 years. “Mr. Cosgrove has been a member for nearly five decades,” Corrinet said in an interview. “In fact, he’s one of the original members in Club 33, and he’s been a member of good standing the entire time.” Disney said Cosgrove has only been a member since 1979. The club opened in 1967. Club 33 is an exclusive members-only club in New Orleans Square in Disneyland and modeled after the VIP lounges that Walt Disney experienced at the 1964 New York World’s Fair. Membership to the private club, is extremely limited, with people reportedly waiting as long as a decade to become a member and, if selected, paying a 25,000 initiation fee and 11,000-plus in annual dues for use of the restaurant and lounge and other benefits. Walt Disney died before the club opened. Disney Co. officials first used the space to entertain VIPs, sponsors and business associates and later turned it into a private club with a paid membership. Cosgrove is a long-time Disney fan whose home is adorned with souvenirs and memorabilia, and he authored the book, “Walt Dreamers Me.” Cosgrove took his wife, Janet, to the club on their first date. Last year, Cosgrove gave a friend a guest-access pass to visit the club. The woman instead auctioned off the pass at a children’s charity unbeknownst to Cosgrove, according to the suit. Members are not allowed to transfer Club 33 access via charity auctions, according to the suit. When Club 33 management learned of the incident, it revoked Cosgrove’s membership. “Disney knew Joe did not sanction nor authorize it,” Corrinet said. “And without any hearing or allowances for him to defend himself, they (Disney officials) threw him out.” Corrinet said the members’ guide states termination is the last step in resolving issues and membership will first be placed on hold “with the intention of resolving issues and infractions.” However, Disneyland spokeswoman Suzi Brown said the Cosgroves frequently misused their membership. “Over the years, the Cosgroves repeatedly transferred and sold their membership privileges, which was a clear violation of membership,” Brown said in an emailed statement. “We, unfortunately, were left with no other choice, in order to preserve the integrity of membership.” Corrinet said he’s reached out multiple times to Disney officials to resolve the matter but to no avail. “Mr. Cosgrove is not trying to lash out at people, he just wants his membership reinstated and some compensation for the grief and costs that he is incurring to fight for his rights,” the attorney said.

Summarize the following: Trimming scissors have a rounded tip designed specifically for safety when trimming hair in sensitive places, such as noses and ears. Facial hair trimming scissors can be found at most major retailers in the cosmetic section. Good lighting helps you see the lighter hairs that may be sticking out of your nose, while the mirror helps you effectively groom the hairs. Even though the scissors have a rounded tip, you need to pay close attention to where you are sticking them. Watch your hand and the scissors closely. Never shove the trimming scissors into your nose, because you can do a lot of damage to your nose by puncturing something. Before inserting the scissors into your nose, make sure the scissors have been cleaned. Just remove the hairs that affect appearance - those sticking out around your nose. The hairs further inside your nose need to remain there to help keep harmful pollutants from your body. Removing nose hair completely could have negative side effects. Make sure your scissors aren't dull. Dull scissors will have a harder time cutting some hairs, and they might even pull out hairs, causing pain and eye watering. Push your nose straight up to get a better view inside your nostrils. Also try smiling. Both of these methods might reveal additional peeking hairs.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 10 months later, first American full face transplant patient smiles FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) – Ten months after becoming the first person to get a full face transplant in the United States, a Fort Worth man marvels at recovering the ability of expression. The progress of 25-year-old Dallas Wiens and the handful of other patients that have undergone the procedure is helping to make the case that it should be more widely available. \\"The ability to smile and to show emotion on my face, even unintentionally, is such a natural thing,\\" Wiens told the Dallas Morning News. \\"Having a new face has changed me dramatically.\\" Wiens' face was burned off in 2008 when his head touched a high-voltage power line while he was standing in an elevated cherry picker. He was also left blind and has not recovered his sight. He underwent more than two dozen surgeries, but they left him with a featureless face. The transplant changed that. \\"I don't look much different than anybody else,\\" he said. Wiens case, and those of two others, were the subject of a study published last month in The New England Journal of Medicine. The procedure can correct \\"severe deformities in a single operation\\" rather than years of reconstructive surgery, the study said. The Department of Defense funded the transplants though a 3.4 million grant with the hope of offering the procedures to wounded soldiers. Wiens was the only patient of the first three surgeries done in the U.S. who did not suffer an acute rejection of the transplant within the first six months, though all suffered infections. The first full face transplant was performed in France in 2005. Since then, 18 patients have shown \\"promising results,\\" the study said. The study also weighed in on early concerns that the donor's facial identity would be transferred to the recipient. \\"It is our subjective opinion, as well as that of two of the donor families, that the patients do not look like their donors,\\" the study concluded. (The third donor family chose to remain anonymous and did not participate in the study.) Wiens, through physical therapy, can once again do things such as control his lips to drink from a glass. And he regained his sense of smell. He has had to return to Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston a couple times for adjustments to make the face fit more snugly. \\"To undergo a face transplant and regain normalcy allows me to do whatever I want to do,\\" he said. \\"It's a journey that I've just started.\\" Summary:","completion":"Ten months after receiving the first full face transplant in the United States, 25-year-old Dallas Wiens has regained the ability to express emotions and smile.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: I can use this background: As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels, farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy, it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are illustrated in the Figure below . Now, I have a new situation: Greg was studying Bohr's model. He found it helpful to categorize different scenarios in the model. First, he labeled electron with higher energy as cat A, and electron with lower energy as cat B. Then he labeled electron that gained energy as cat C, and election that lost energy as cat D. Answer this question please: Which electron would be farther from the nucleus, cat A or cat B? The answer is:","completion":"Cat A would be farther from the nucleus. According to Bohr's model, electrons with higher energy are found at higher energy levels, which are farther from the nucleus.

Abstract: The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are key regulators of inflammation and interfere with insulin action in cultured cells and whole animals. Obesity increases total JNK activity, and JNK1, but not JNK2, deficiency results in reduced adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, a higher-than-normal level of JNK activation is observed in Jnk2(-/-) mice, particularly in the liver, indicating an interaction between the isoforms that might have masked the metabolic activity of JNK2 in isolated mutant mice. To address the role of the JNK2 isoform in metabolic homeostasis, we intercrossed Jnk1(-/-) and Jnk2(-/-) mice and examined body weight and glucose metabolism in the resulting mutant allele combinations. Among all of the viable genotypes examined, we observed only reduced body weight and increased insulin sensitivity in Jnk1(-/-) and Jnk1(+/-)Jnk2(-/-) mice. These two groups of mice also exhibited reduced total JNK activity and cytokine expression in liver tissue compared with all other genotypes examined. These data indicate that the JNK2 isoform is also involved in metabolic regulation, but its function is not obvious when JNK1 is fully expressed because of regulatory crosstalk between the two isoforms..

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Background: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. Paragraph: Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores. The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which pack had more difficulty targeting prey animals? Answer:","completion":"The Mobutu pack had more difficulty targeting prey animals. Step 1: Identify the hunting strategies of the two packs. - The Simba pack targets wounded individual prey animals. - The Mobutu pack targets large groups of zebras and other grazers. Step 2: Relate their strategies to the background information about zebras and predator confusion. - According to the background information, zebras traveling in herds with their striped patterns can confuse predators, making it harder for predators to focus on an individual zebra. - Moving zebras also create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. Step 3: Determine which pack's strategy aligns with the predator confusion caused by zebras. - The Mobutu pack follows large groups of zebras, which matches the conditions described in the background information that can lead to predator confusion.

Q:This article: In the interim came The Beatles, a double LP commonly known as the White Album for its virtually featureless cover.

At his ashram in Rishikesh, India, a \\"Guide Course\\" scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs including a majority of the 30 included on the album. However, Starr left after only ten days, likening it to Butlins, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to questioning when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them. When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled \\"Maharishi\\", renamed \\"Sexy Sadie\\" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, \\"We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was.\\"During recording sessions for the White Album, which stretched from late May to mid-October 1968, relations between the Beatles grew openly divisive.

Define the scope: Consider the historical period of the Roman Empire and its subsequent transformation into Christian Rome. 2. Identify the key event: Search for a specific event or decree that marked the shift to Christianity as the official religion. 3. Verify the date: Confirm the date of the event or decree. Step 1: Defining the scope The Roman Empire, founded in 27 BCE, was a vast and powerful civilization that lasted for centuries. Its religious beliefs and practices evolved significantly over time, with various gods and goddesses worshipped in different regions. Christianity was introduced to Rome in the 1st century CE and grew steadily despite periods of persecution. Step 2: Identifying the key event The key event marking the shift to Christianity as the official religion of Rome is the Edict of Thessalonica, also known as the Edict of Milan, issued by Emperor Theodosius I in 380 CE. This edict commanded all citizens of the Roman Empire to adhere to the Christian faith as defined by the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE, making it the official state religion. Step 3: Verifying the date The Edict of Thessalonica was issued on February 27, 380 CE.

In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.

As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Theodosian Code—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests. At the emperor's death, the Byzantines had control of most of Italy, North Africa, and a small foothold in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and setting the stage for the Muslim conquests, but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.

Melanie and Jacob have an ongoing flirtation with each other.John is trying to evade the IRS, to whom he owes back taxes. One night he thinks the IRS has come for him, so he jumps out his bedroom window, and Ariel surprisingly shows up, asking to use his bathroom for no particular reason. She discloses that she has been watching how John and Max both ogle her.The next day, John tries to convince Max that his visit from Ariel was amorous in intent.

Given the below context: Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group...

Answer the following question: how does one convert poly-unsaturated fats into saturated fat?","completion":"Converting polyunsaturated fats into saturated fats is not a simple process and is usually not carried out by individuals in a home setting. The process typically requires a chemical reaction called hydrogenation. This answer will provide an understanding of the basic concepts, the process of conversion, and the consequences of consuming hydrogenated fats. Saturated and Unsaturated Fats: The main distinction between saturated and unsaturated fats lies in their chemical structure. Fats (or fatty acids) are composed of long carbon chains with hydrogen atoms connected. In saturated fats, the carbon atoms are single-bonded, and the molecule contains the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, possess one or more double bonds between their carbon atoms, and the molecules contain fewer hydrogen atoms relative to saturated fats. Unsaturated fats can be further categorized into monounsaturated (one double bond) and polyunsaturated (two or more double bonds). Hydrogenation Process: Hydrogenation is the process of converting unsaturated fats into saturated fats by breaking down the double bonds and attaching hydrogen atoms. This is done by exposing the fat to hydrogen gas, usually in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel, palladium, or platinum, and applying heat and pressure to assist the reaction. In the food industry, this method is commonly employed to increase the stability and shelf-life of oils and fats. Partial and Full Hydrogenation: There are two types of hydrogenation: partial and full. Partial hydrogenation modifies the fat's properties in a controlled manner, keeping some double bonds intact while hydrogenating others. The result is a semi-solid fat, such as margarine or shortening. Full hydrogenation, as the name suggests, saturates all double bonds. However, it's worth noting that partial hydrogenation can lead to the production of trans fats, which have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Consequences of Consuming Hydrogenated Fats: While converting polyunsaturated fats into saturated fats can increase the stability and shelf-life, it may come with certain health risks. Hydrogenated fats, particularly those containing trans fats, have been associated with increasing total and LDL cholesterol levels and contribute to a higher risk of heart disease. Along with that, removing the polyunsaturated fats may also result in the loss of essential fatty acids like omega-3 and omega-6, which play a vital role in the maintenance of cell function and regulation of inflammation. Due to these health risks, it's generally recommended to limit the consumption of hydrogenated fats and opt for healthier options like natural sources of saturated fats (such as dairy and animal fats) or mono- and polyunsaturated fats (found in olive, canola, and flaxseed oils). To summarize, converting polyunsaturated fats into saturated fats involves a chemical process called hydrogenation. By breaking down the double bonds in the fat molecule and attaching hydrogen atoms, hydrogenation can transform unsaturated fats into saturated fats. Although using hydrogenated fats can improve the stability and shelf-life of the product, excessive consumption of them may lead to increased health risks. It is always advisable to introduce healthier fats into the diet to maintain a balanced nutritional intake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

Goal: How do I say the alphabet backwards Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"To say the alphabet backwards, there are several methods that you can try, and the most effective method for you would depend on how your mind works and how well you can memorize content. I will present three different methods, and you can choose which is most reasonable for you. Method 1: Memorization The first method is straightforward memorization. In this case, you simply memorize the alphabet in reverse order. Repeat the sequence over and over again until you can recite it without difficulty. The reverse alphabetical sequence is: Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O, N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A Memorizing the reverse alphabet can be made easier by breaking it down into small groups. You can try memorizing segments, like this: - Z, Y, X - W, V, U - T, S, R - Q, P, O - N, M, L - K, J, I - H, G, F - E, D, C - B, A Method 2: Visualization If you are a visual learner, you can try visualizing the alphabet in a specific location (e.g., written on a whiteboard or along a wall). Picture each letter in this location, in reverse order. As you visualize each letter, say it out loud. Practice this a few times by looking at the visual representation of the reversed alphabet and reciting it. Eventually, you will be able to recall the sequence without needing the visual aid. Method 3: Alphabet song reverse adaptation Most people are familiar with the classic alphabet song, which is helpful for remembering the letters in order.

Fact 2: Macaques are known for their aggressive behavior. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"what intends to cause harm or pain\\" with the following options: - macaques - complex - A drug. - A computer - humans - animals - an object - Toxicity A:","completion":"Given the two facts presented — Fact 1: Aggression is behavior that is intended to cause harm or pain, and Fact 2: Macaques are known for their aggressive behavior — the most appropriate answer to the question \\"what intends to cause harm or pain\\" is macaques. Macaques are a group of primates commonly found in Asia, North Africa and Gibraltar. They exhibit aggressive behavior which, as defined by Fact 1, is intended to cause harm or pain. This association makes macaques the most suitable answer to the question. While some of the other options mentioned may potentially cause harm or pain under specific circumstances, they don't inherently possess aggression as a core characteristic. For example: - Complex: A complex represents a structure or a group of interconnected elements. It does not inherently have intentions or the ability to cause harm or pain. - A drug: A drug can cause harm or pain as a side effect, but its intended purpose is generally to alleviate symptoms or treat a medical condition. It's worth noting that some drugs are developed and marketed with the intent to cause harm (e.g. chemical weapons), but this is not the primary purpose of most drugs. - A computer: A computer is an electronic device designed to process information and perform various functions. While computers can be used as tools for harm, they, as inanimate objects, do not inherently have intentions or the ability to cause pain or harm. - Humans and animals: While some humans and animals display aggressive behavior and may intend to cause harm or pain, not all individuals within these categories have these intentions. Thus, it's too broad and inaccurate to say that either humans or animals as a whole intend to cause harm or pain. - An object: An object, as an inanimate thing, does not have intentions or the ability to cause harm or pain without human interaction or some external force. - Toxicity: Toxicity refers to the degree to which a substance can harm living organisms. While some substances may have harmful effects, toxicity is not an entity that possesses intentions or the ability to cause harm or pain on its own but rather a characteristic of certain substances. In conclusion, among the given options, macaques are the most accurate answer to the question “what intends to cause harm or pain,” as they are known for exhibiting aggressive behavior that can lead to harm or pain. It is crucial to understand that although other options might cause harm or pain, they don’t inherently possess intentions or aggression as a characteristic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"The Tai Situpa is even supposed to have written in his will: \\"In the past I received loving care from the emperor in the east.\\" answer the question \\"Who wrote in their will that they received loving care from the emperor in the east?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"The Tai Situpa is even supposed to have written in his will: 'In the past I received loving care from the emperor in the east.'\\" answers the question, \\"Who wrote in their will that they received loving care from the emperor in the east?\\" The person mentioned in the sentence is the Tai Situpa, who is the one that allegedly wrote this statement in his will. The Tai Situpa is an important figure in the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. The title \\"Tai Situpa\\" is given to the person who holds the position of the throne holder at the Surmang Monastery in Tibet. This person is considered a tulku, or a reincarnated lama, possessing great spiritual wisdom and capabilities. There have been several Tai Situpas throughout history, with each one being the successor of the previous tulku. The quote from the will suggests that the Tai Situpa had a connection with an emperor in the east, who he received loving care from in the past. This statement indicates that the Tai Situpa had a relationship with the emperor that transcended geographical, cultural and religious boundaries. This relationship could have been rooted in the shared spiritual and philosophical beliefs between the two individuals, as the emperor might have been a supporter of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, or a patron of the Surmang Monastery. Furthermore, the phrase \\"loving care\\" implies that the emperor provided assistance, support, or patronage to the Tai Situpa, which could be in the form of financial, political, or moral support. This could have played a vital role in upholding the monastic institution and ensuring the continuation of the lineage of the Tai Situpas. In conclusion, the sentence provided does answer the question about who wrote that they received loving care from the emperor in the east in their will. The Tai Situpa was the one who made this statement, indicating a connection with an emperor who provided him with care and support in the past. This suggests that the relationship between the Tai Situpa and the emperor was of mutual respect, understanding, and a shared belief in the spiritual values of Tibetan Buddhism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What area do indigenous people call Warlmanpa? Indigenous Australians have lived in parts of the Northern Territory for around 40,000 years. Pre-European settlement numbers are not known with any precision, although the Indigenous population of the Northern Territory has been estimated at \\"well over 10,000\\". The area now known as Muckaty Station (often referred to as just \\"Muckaty\\", though the origin of this name and near variants such as \\"Mucketty\\" is unknown) was – and is – the responsibility of seven clans of traditional Indigenous owners: Milwayi, Ngapa, Ngarrka, Wirntiku, Kurrakurraja, Walanypirri and Yapayapa. The country is known by the Indigenous name Warlmanpa, which is also the name of a local language.Although there had been several unsuccessful attempts by British or colonial authorities to settle in the Northern Territory, there was no permanent European presence until surveyor George Goyder in 1869 established what is now known as Darwin. The timing was auspicious: in October 1870 the South Australian government decided to construct an overland telegraph line, from Port Augusta on the continent's south coast, to the new settlement just established in the country's tropical north. The line traversed what is now Muckaty Station, with repeater stations built at Powell's Creek to the north and Tennant's Creek to the south. At the same time as the telegraph line was completed in August 1872, a cattle industry was beginning to develop in central and northern Australia. The first pastoral lease in the Northern Territory was granted in 1872, and by 1911 there were at least 250 such leases covering over 180,000 square miles (470,000 km2) of the jurisdiction. The Muckaty pastoral lease was created in the late 19th century. Currently the property is surrounded by other leases including Powell Creek to the north, Helen Springs Station to the east with Philip Creek and Banka Banka Stations to the south.

Which of these statements best describes this new theory? Select from: (A). Earth is at the center of the solar system.; (B). There are eight planets in the solar system.; (C). The Sun is at the center of the solar system.; (D). Moons have circular orbits in the solar system.;","completion":"(C). The Sun is at the center of the solar system. In the 1500s, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model of the solar system, which revolutionized the way astronomers and scientists understood the structure and dynamics of our cosmic neighborhood. The heliocentric model presented a groundbreaking new perspective on the solar system, with the Sun at its center, as opposed to the longstanding geocentric model, which placed Earth at the center. The geocentric model, also known as the Ptolemaic system, had been the dominant astronomical model since antiquity. It described the solar system as a series of concentric spheres, with Earth at the center and all celestial bodies, including the Sun, Moon, and planets, orbiting around it in perfect circles. Contrary to this belief, Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model, which stated that the Sun, not Earth, was at the center of the solar system. This new model was published in his seminal work, \\"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\\" (\\"On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres\\") in 1543, the same year as his death. According to Copernicus, the planets, including Earth, revolve in circular orbits around the Sun, and the Moon revolves around Earth. He envisioned these orbits as concentric circles, with the Sun occupying the central position. By placing the Sun at the center, Copernicus was able to explain several astronomical phenomena, such as the retrograde motion of planets and seasonal changes on Earth, more accurately than the geocentric model. His ideas laid the groundwork for future scientists like Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton, who expanded upon the heliocentric model and developed a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the solar system. It should be noted that the heliocentric model did not account for the number of planets in the solar system, and in Copernicus's time only six planets were known: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. As for the statement (D), moons having circular orbits in the solar system, this would apply to both geocentric and heliocentric models, but it does not describe the primary change brought about by Copernicus's theory. In conclusion, the statement that best describes Nicolaus Copernicus's new theory on the heliocentric structure of the solar system in the 1500s is: (C) The Sun is at the center of the solar system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There are two kinds of memory: short-term and long-term. Information in long-term memory can be remembered at a later time when it is needed. The information may be kept for days or weeks. However, information in short-term memory is kept for only a few seconds, usually by repeating the information over and over. The following experiment shows how short-term memory has been studied. Henning studied how students who are learning English as a second language remember vocabulary. The subjects in his experiment were 75 college students. They represented all levels of ability in English: beginning, intermediate , and native speaking students. To begin, the subjects listened to a recording of a native speaker reading a paragraph in English. Following the recording, the subjects took a 15-question test to see which words they remembered. Each question had four choices. The subjects had to circle the word they had heard in the recording, Some of the questions had four choices that sound alike. For example, weather, whether, wither, and wetter are four words that sound alike. Some of the questions had four choices that have the same meaning. Method, way, manner, and system would be four words with the same meaning. Finally the subjects took a language proficiency test. Henning found that students with a lower proficiency in English made more of their mistakes on words that sound alike; students with a higher proficiency made more of their mistakes on words that have the same meaning. Henning's results suggest that beginning students hold the sound of words in their short-term memory, and advanced students hold the meaning of words in their short-term memory.

Pick from: A). yes; B). it is not possible to tell; C). no;","completion":"C). No The hypothesis \\"Consumption is declining\\" is not true based on the given premise. The premise states that \\"Government figures indicate that cigarette consumption is holding steady and may be rising.\\" This implies that cigarette consumption has not decreased as the hypothesis suggests; instead, it remains stable or may even be increasing. To further elaborate, the premise provides information on cigarette consumption from a credible source - government figures. According to these figures, there is no indication of a decline in consumption. Holding steady means that the usage is constant, not increasing or decreasing. The statement also allows for the possibility that consumption could be on the rise, thus reinforcing the idea that the hypothesis of declining consumption is not true. In conclusion, based on the presented premise, it is clear that the hypothesis \\"Consumption is declining\\" is not true. The government figures, which serve as a reliable source of information on cigarette consumption, indicate that usage is either remaining steady or potentially going up.

Instead, the title of the album, \\"Life, Love, and the Pursuit of Justice,\\" explicitly states that these are the themes Justin Sane, lead singer of the punk rock band Anti-Flag, seeks to explore in his first solo album. As it is his own work, the album entirely features his vocal and guitar performances, drawing significant influence from Billy Bragg's earlier recordings. The themes of life, love, and justice are intricately interwoven throughout the album. The theme of life could encompass various aspects, such as personal growth, relationships, and the human experience in general. The theme of love might touch upon romantic relationships or the broader aspects of love, such as empathy, compassion, and brotherhood. The theme of justice is likely to address social and political issues, which is typical of punk rock music. Given Justin Sane's background as the lead singer of the politically-driven punk band Anti-Flag, it is reasonable to assume that the concept of justice represents a significant component of the album. In conclusion, it is incorrect to infer that the album is not about justice, love, and life.

Berlusconi as Russia's ambassador to the Vatican. The pair have defended each other through thick and thin, so the move is hardly surprising for the ever-controversial pair. The Russian president has attended the Italian’s infamous bunga bunga parties while Mr Putin reciprocated with holidays at his dacha on the Black Sea. Friends: It has been claimed Vladimir Putin, left, who met the Pope in Rome's Vatican City, reportedly wants to make disgraced Silvio Berlusconi, right, a Russian ambassador - giving him diplomatic immunity. Pope Francis shakes hand with Russian President Vladimir Putin as they exchange gifts during the private audience at the Vatican City. They have attended extreme fighting events together and Mr Putin even has a bed named after him at the 77-year-old billionaire’s mansion. Now their unlikely bond has taken a new turn, with Mr Putin said to be poised to make the former Italian prime minister the Russian envoy to the Vatican. Such a move would confer diplomatic immunity on Berlusconi – and an escape from his latest legal woes courtesy of his old pal in the Kremlin. After being convicted of tax fraud, the politician is this week facing expulsion from the Italian parliament, a move that would strip him of some legal protection. Putin is on a two-day visit in Italy. He will also meet with Italian President Giorgio Napolitano and Premier Enrico Letta. In September the Pope wrote directly to Putin imploring him to co-operate with other international leaders to help the people of Syria. The three-time premier had hoped for a last minute pardon but Italian President Giorgio Napolitano has made it clear that this is not on his agenda. He is also appealing against a conviction for sex with underage prostitute Ruby ‘the heart-stealer’, and faces a new trial for an alleged £2.5million bribe to a senator. As well as legal immunity, the post would give Berlusconi a diplomatic passport, allowing him to visit his luxury overseas properties – something he has been denied since his old passport was cancelled by the authorities. Putin kisses the gift he presented to Pope Francis during the private audience at the Vatican City. Although the two have clashed over Syria, they agree that outside military intervention will escalate the civil war. Former KGB agent Mr Putin was last night arriving in Rome to meet Pope Francis and Italian ministers but he is also scheduled to meet Berlusconi. A political source told an Italian newspaper: ‘Putin’s idea is clear: he plans to nominate Berlusconi as ambassador to the Holy See, a strategy that would save him from persecution by the judiciary.’ Mr Putin held private talks with Pope Francis about the Syrian conflict, months after the Pope sent him an angry letter criticising the G20's failure to provide more aid. In. September the Pope wrote directly to Putin imploring him to co-operate. with other international leaders to help the people of Syria. Cosy: Berlusconi and Putin are firm friends, despite both being controversial figures on the world stage. Friends: The pair during a mid-air meeting in April 2004. Since then Berlusconi has been given several jail terms. So far the reports that Putin, left, could make Berlusconi, right, a Russian ambassador are unconfirmed. Pope Francis and Putin did agree on one thing, however - they were both against the British and U.S. push for military intervention. Putin refused to take sides in the conflict, while the Pope said it was important that the violence did not escalate. But the pair differ publicly in several areas including on gay rights. While the Pope has reportedly taken a softer line, Putin has cracked down on gay rights and criminalised protests in favour. And there is a long-running religious feud between the Vatican and the Russian Orthodox church, which have been at loggerheads since the fall of the Soviet Union. Russian church figures have accused the Vatican of trying to convert their worshippers to make them Catholic. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Q: Evaporation, condensation, and precipitation are all processes which occur in the What is the correct answer to this question?","completion":"The correct answer to this question is that evaporation, condensation, and precipitation are all processes which occur in the hydrologic cycle, also known as the water cycle. The hydrologic cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It is a fundamental process that is essential for sustaining life on our planet as it circulates water through ecosystems, provides freshwater resources, and influences climate. Here is a brief description of each of the processes mentioned in the question: 1. Evaporation: Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor, driven mainly by solar energy. Water evaporates from various sources, such as lakes, rivers, oceans, soil, and vegetation. As water evaporates, it absorbs heat from its surroundings, cooling the environment. This is an essential process, as it is the primary way water vapor enters the atmosphere, contributing to cloud formation and, ultimately, precipitation. 2. Condensation: Condensation is the process by which water vapor changes back into a liquid state. As water vapor in the atmosphere rises and cools, it starts to condense around tiny particles, such as dust, creating water droplets or ice crystals. These droplets come together to form clouds. Condensation also releases heat into the atmosphere, which is an essential factor in the formation and intensification of weather systems, such as storms and hurricanes. 3. Precipitation: Precipitation is the multi-faceted process by which water droplets or ice crystals in clouds become heavy enough to fall to the Earth's surface. It includes various forms like rain, snow, sleet, and hail. Precipitation occurs when clouds grow and accumulate enough water droplets or ice crystals, which then combine to form larger droplets or particles that are heavy enough to overcome the resistance of the air and fall to the ground. Precipitation is the primary way that water in the atmosphere returns to Earth's surface, supplying water to bodies of water, replenishing groundwater, irrigating plants, and providing various other benefits to ecosystems and human societies. Besides these three processes, there are also other important components of the hydrologic cycle, such as infiltration (water seeping into the ground), runoff (water flowing over land to join streams, rivers, or other water bodies), and transpiration (water vapor being released from plants back into the atmosphere). All of these processes are interconnected, maintaining the overall balance of water on Earth and supporting the diverse ecosystems and human activities that rely on water to survive and thrive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Remember, the image will shrink down to ½ to 2/3 of its original size by the time you are done.You can use any sort of image you like, but simple outlines (like those from a coloring book) might be easier to work with. If the image is on your computer, you will need to print it out onto regular printer paper. You can resize the image using an image editing program or a photocopier. Use a fine grit sandpaper, and lightly buff the surface of the shrink film. This will help the paint stick better. It is not necessary for colored pencils or markers. Try to go over the lines as smoothly as you can. If the shrink plastic moves around too much, you can tape it down to the table. If you can't find shrink film, you can use any type of number 6 plastic. It is usually found on take-out containers. Look for the recycling symbol on the container. There should be a number inside of it. If it is a 6, you can use it. Try to stick within the lines as much as possible. If you go over the lines, don't worry; you will be re-outlining the piece again. If you are using acrylic paints, be sure to thin them down first using a little bit of water. This will give you a smoother finish. It will also prevent the paint from clumping up after you back it. If you colored your design using markers or paint, wait for everything to dry first, or it will smear. You can use a pair of scissors or a craft knife to do this. Make sure that you cut right along the outline; try not to leave any white edges. If your package does not have any instructions, bake the shapes at 350°F (176.6°C) in a pre-heated oven until the pieces lay flat. This can take anywhere between 5 minutes and 35 minutes. Don't worry if the pieces start to warp and curl while baking. They will eventually flatten back out. If you are using number 6 plastic, bake the pieces at 350°F (176.6°C) for about 3½ minutes. If you want, you can bend them while they are still warm to give then an interesting shape. You can use a spray-on or brush-on sealer. You can even paint on a few layers of a decoupage glue.

Given the question: Given the following context: American singer Prudencesa Renfro, professionally known as Pru, was signed through Warner/Chappell Music Publishing by Capitol Records' executive Roy Lott, who said that he was \\"drawn to\\" her songwriting and voice. Jack Ponti, of Cazzy Dog Management, had helped Pru produce a demo tape to secure the record deal. Lott had noted Pru's potential as an artist through her lyrics. He worked closely with her to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound, serving as the executive producer for her debut studio album Pru.Prior to securing a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in artists such as Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: \\"From a word, I can get a whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis.\\" She considered her music as a form of poetry, citing the album track \\"Hazy Shades\\" as an example of a poem turned into a song.Pru stated that she wanted her songs to bring variety to contemporary R&B, and described the material as the opposite of the formulaic music typically found on radio. On her official website, the singer identified her style as connected with the soul. Though AllMusic gives the singer songwriting credit on twelve of the tracks, Pru is only credited for co-writing \\"Aaroma\\" on the album's liner notes. The record was completed at Studio 57 and Weight Room in New York City, with mixing handled by Mike Shipley and Tony Maserati. Following release of the album, Pru spoke highly of her experiences with the producers and felt that they \\"la[id] a good bed around the lyrics and the melodies\\". answer the following question: What is the last of the person who worked closely with a singer to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound?

Soon she became his fiancee. The man was very poor while the girl was rich. The young man wanted to make her a present on her birthday. He wanted to buy something beautiful for her, but he had no idea how to do it, as he had very little money. The next morning he went to a shop. There were many fine things there: gold watches, diamond... but all these things were too expensive. There was one thing he could not take his eyes off. It was a beautiful vase. That was a suitable present for his fiancee. He had been looking at the vase for half an hour when the manager of the shop noticed him. The young man looked so pale, sad and unhappy that the manager asked what had happened to him. The young man told him everything. The manager felt sorry for him and decided to help him. A bright idea struck him. The manager pointed to the corner of the shop. To his great surprise the young man saw a vase broken into many pieces. The manager said: \\"When the servant enters the room, he will drop it.\\" On the birthday of his fiancee the young man was very excited. Everything happened as had been planned.

Here is an article: ABC’s RICK KLEIN: Breaking bread beats everything staying broken. President Obama’s move to dine and even just talk to House and Senate Republicans (and Democrats, for that matter) is surprising out of a White House that never likes to admit it’s changing course. But this actually is different: It’s conceivable that, by the end of next week, Obama will have had more direct interaction with more rank-and-file lawmakers in his second term than he did in the entirety of his first term. The numbers here are key; the strategy isn’t to pick off one Republican at a time, but to soften GOP ground enough that a grand bargain is possible, with a wide swath of Republicans at least staying at the table. Whatever the result, it’s definitely better than staying hungry. ABC’s Z. BYRON WOLF: It doesn’t really have anything to do with drones and he isn’t an American citizen, but the secret extradition this year and public arraignment in federal court today of Saulaiman Abu Ghaith — Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law — has the potential to reignite a simmering debate about what to do with suspected terrorists. Rand Paul’s complaint with President Obama over drones is that they are an extra judicial form of justice. But President Obama had to bow to public opinion early in his first term and back off a promise to close Guantanamo Bay and utilize the American judicial system. Some Republicans who were defending Obama against Paul on drones must think that is where the administration should have sent Abu Ghaith. ABC’s DEVIN DWYER: The appearance of Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law in a New York City courtroom today marks a significant achievement for President Obama. Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, a top al Qaeda spokesman captured during a secret operation earlier this year, will be the highest-ranking figure from the terrorist network to be tried in a federal criminal court, according to U.S. officials. The arraignment comes after years of congressional roadblocks to Obama’s plan to try alleged foreign terror suspects in U.S. courts and to shutter the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay. By law, the administration is forbidden from transferring Gitmo detainees to U.S. soil, forcing prosecutors to try Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four other alleged 9/11 plotters before a military commission rather than in a New York City court. Several Republican lawmakers now say Abu Ghaith must be tried the same way. ”We’re putting the administration on notice,” Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday. “We think that sneaking this guy into the country, clearly going around the intent of Congress when it comes to enemy combatants, will be challenged.” ABC’s MICHAEL FALCONE: Did Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus basically call Karl Rove a fool? We’re certain he’d quibble with that assertion, but while in Iowa yesterday, he weighed in on the move by the Karl Rove-backed group, American Crossroads, to launch a new organization to weed out “problem” Republican primary candidates. One of the first targets of the new group, which is called the Conservative Victory Project, was said to be Iowa GOP Congressman Steve King, an ultraconservative who is considering a bid for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Tom Harkin. So what does RNC Chairman Reince Priebus think about it? “I don’t believe the party should pick winners and losers in primaries and I think it’s, historically, if you look at it, it’s a bit of a fool’s game because you can’t actually predict some of the things that go on.” According to Radio Iowa’s O. Kay Henderson, Priebus also told reporters that when it comes to Republican losses last year, “I don’t think our platform is the issue.” He added, “I think a lot of times it’s some of these biologically stupid things that people say, you know, that I believe caused a lot of the problems.” –”WHITE HOUSE REPORTER BALANCES WORKING AND BREASTFEEDING,” by Yahoo News’ Rachel Rose Hartman. “When I imagined my journalism career, I never pictured myself standing shirtless in a unisex bathroom in the White House. But that is precisely where I found myself in November, as a new mother of a nursing infant returning from maternity leave to cover the president. Hiding in a bathroom is a common condition for many breastfeeding moms seeking a private place to pump milk in their workplace. But it’s a condition the White House has been trying to eliminate. Under President Barack Obama’s new health care law, employers with more than 50 workers are required to provide a private lactation space other than a restroom for nursing mothers up to one year after giving birth. So then why was I stuck pumping in a bathroom at the very address where the lactation room requirement had originated?” Read Rachel’s first-person story: http://yhoo.it/YgCfzx –”FROM ‘MONEYBALL’ TO MONEY BOMBS: WHAT SPORTS ANALYTICS CAN TEACH POLITICAL NERDS,” an Op-Ed in the Atlantic by Rob Bluey who leads the digital-media team at the Heritage Foundation. ”A swarm of political strategists will descend on Austin, Texas, this week for South by Southwest’s Interactive Festival. It’s one of the premier tech conferences of the year — the place where Twitter made its big splash in 2007. If the political class is going to embrace innovation, SXSW is a good place to start. As many of my peers prepare for the trip to Austin, I have a story to share from Boston, where I attended the seventh annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference last weekend. I heard about the event from a Sports Illustrated story about the Houston Rockets, a team whose data-driven general manager, Daryl Morey, earned his MBA at Sloan. What, if anything, could a sports analytics conference teach a political junkie?” Read Bluey’s analysis: http://bit.ly/10phKHJ –A LIGHTENING ROUND WITH FORMER PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR LUIS FORTUÑO. Luis Fortuño, former governor of Puerto Rico, is a rare breed–or so they say–in the current American political landscape: he’s a Latino Republican. And, when it comes to immigration reform, Fortuño says the Republican Party needs to take the lead in fixing the country’s immigration system. “Clearly the immigration system is broken, it’s not working well,” Fortuño told ABC’s Rick Klein and Michael Falcone in the latest installment of “Top Line.” “Of course we need to protect our border, on the one hand. On the other hand, we have to realize that there are 11 million people working and living among us. We need to make sure they can continue to work and live among us one way or another.” Fortuño emphasizes that, in order for immigration reform legislation to appeal to the Latino community, it must provide a path for those illegal immigrants already living in the United States to remain here legally. But he stopped short of saying an explicit path to citizenship must be part of an immigration bill. “The most important aspect for our community regarding this immigration bill is allowing for those 10 to 11 million people who are here illegally to be able to work here, live here, contribute to our society, and have their children live the American dream,” he said.

With his resignation now official, the Catholic Church is in a period known as the “sede vacante”– which means vacant seat — and the College of Cardinals has begun meeting in Rome to discuss the start of the conclave which will elect the new pope.

Not everyone was so convinced by Rand Paul’s near thirteen hour filibuster, notes ABC’s Sunlen Miller. Two Republican colleagues — Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham — called his speech a “political stunt” and the Attorney General send a terse, one-line letter to the Kentucky senator. Paul built his argument Wednesday around a letter Monday in which Attorney General Eric Holder said the president has the power, however unlikely it would be used, to strike within the U.S. at an American terror suspect. No more nuance on Thursday after Paul’s filibuster. Holder Responded to an additional question from Paul with a single word: “no.” “It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: ‘Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?’” wrote Holder. “The answer to that question is no.” http://abcn.ws/W8xHOS SEQUESTER AT HOME: UNCERTAINTY IN DC SUBURB MEANS HIGHER TAXES. Residents of Virginia’s most populous county should expect to see a bump in their property tax bill this year, thanks to economic uncertainty fostered by – you guessed it – Washington and the sequester, a county official said Thursday, ABC’s Sarah Parnass reports. Fairfax County, a D.C. suburb ranked one of the top three richest counties in the country, depends on government contracts for much of its commercial revenue. As agencies are tightening their belts in some places and throwing their hands up on others trying to figure out how the 85 billion budget cuts will affect them, businesses lack the stability to expand, according to Braddock District Supervisor John Cook of Fairfax County. County officials have named sequestration one of the factors shaping their plans for the coming year. http://abcn.ws/VLYEck ARKANSAS STATE SENATE PASSES ABORTION BAN. Arkansas State Sen. Jason Rapert succeeded in banning early-term abortions in his state on Wednesday, notes ABC’s Chris Good. The Arkansas General Assembly enacted the nation’s most restrictive abortion law on Wednesday, overriding Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe’s veto and banning abortions when a woman has been pregnant for more than 12 weeks and an abdominal ultrasound shows the fetus has a heartbeat. Abortion-rights groups, including Planned Parenthood, quickly denounced the law. The Center for Reproductive Rights and the Arkansas ACLU plan to file a lawsuit, seeking to overturn it. But just a few hours after his bill passed, Rapert — the lead sponsor of the 12-week abortion ban — introduced another bill to defund Planned Parenthood. http://abcn.ws/WxhiGb OBAMA SIGNS VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN REAUTHORIZATION ACT. President Obama signed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act yesterday, expanding protections for victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault, ABC’s Mary Bruce reports. “This is a country where everybody should be able to pursue their own measure of happiness and live their lives free from fear, no matter who you are, no matter who you love. That’s got to be our priority. That’s what today is about,” he said at a bill signing ceremony at the Interior Department. “This is your day. This is the day of the advocates, the day of the survivors. This is your victory,” he said. “This victory shows that when the American people make their voices heard, Washington listens.” The renewal of the 1994 legislation, championed by then Sen. Joe Biden, makes it easier to prosecute crimes against women, including domestic violence, sexual assault and trafficking. The bill also extends protections to gays and lesbians and women of Native American tribal lands who are attacked or abused by non-tribal residents. http://abcn.ws/10dGKOo MICHIGAN SENATOR CARL LEVIN WON’T SEEK ANOTHER TERM. Another one bites the dust. ABC’s Sunlen Miller reports that Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman, announced last night that he will not run for reelection in 2014. Levin, 78, said the decision for him was “extremely difficult” but he decided with his wife that he could do a better job as a senator without campaigning. “We decided that I can best serve my state and nation by concentrating in the next two years on the challenging issues before us that I am in a position to help address,” Levin said, “in other words, by doing my job without the distraction of campaigning for reelection.” Levin, the senior Senator from Michigan, was first elected into the Senate in 1978. @MarthaRaddatz: “@Cirincione: I talked with @MarthaRaddatz about NKorea threat.

Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area. This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups, which may reduce pathogen transmission, or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture. Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior, which may reduce pathogen transmission. It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates. Higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate. There is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load, making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important. Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism, which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections. There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load. Thus, polygny may also be due to a lower male:female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases.

Initialize all elements to 0. Step 3: Find the lengths of common subsequences Iterate through matrix rows (i) starting at 1, and columns (j) starting at 1: If A[i-1] == B[j-1], set matrix[i][j] to matrix[i-1][j-1] + 1. Else, set matrix[i][j] to the maximum of matrix[i-1][j] and matrix[i][j-1]. Step 4: Backtrack to find the longest common subsequence Start at the bottom-right corner of the matrix and work your way up and left: If A[i-1] == B[j-1], add A[i-1] to the subsequence and move diagonally up and left. Else, move either left or up, depending on the greater value of matrix[i-1][j] and matrix[i][j-1]. Step 5: Reverse the subsequence and return it as output. Performing the steps: Step 1: A = [1973, 8431, 9633, 'c', 'j', 'x', 'z', 'E', 4673, 7239, 7609, 'R', 'W', '8375', 'y', '4801', '4445', 'p', '5475', 'w', 'c', '4139', '2809', 'x', 'f', '8321', 'c', 'g', 'h'] B = ['B', 1095, 'W', 'z', '8375', 'y', '4801', '4445', 'p', '5475', 'w', 'c', '4139', '2809', 'x', 'f', '8321', 'c', 'o', 'W', 9983, 'm', 'S', 'M'] Step 2: Initialize a matrix of dimensions 30x25 with all elements set to 0. Step 3: Fill the matrix with the lengths of common subsequences. Step 4: Backtrack in the matrix to find the longest common subsequence. Step 5: Reverse the subsequence and return it as output: ['W', 'z', '8375', 'y', '4801', '4445', 'p', '5475', 'w', 'c', '4139', '2809', 'x', 'f', '8321', 'c']"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's examine the differences between the two sentences in detail: Sentence 1: The field also included Olympian (and in 1932 Olympic champion) Paul Jessup of Cornell in 1928 and future world record maker John Anderson of Washington. In this sentence, the field has two notable participants. Paul Jessup, who studied at Cornell University, is an Olympian and the 1932 Olympic champion. This sentence implies that Jessup was competing in the field in 1928. Another remarkable participant is John Anderson, who is from Washington and is denoted as a future world record maker. This sentence gives precedence to Paul Jessup and his achievements. Sentence 2: The field also included Olympian (and in 1932 Olympic champion) John Anderson of Cornell and future world record player Paul Jessup of Washington in 1928. In the second sentence, the notable participants have been switched. Here, it conveys that John Anderson, who studied at Cornell University, is an Olympian and the 1932 Olympic champion. Paul Jessup, who is from Washington, is mentioned as a future world record player. The year 1928 is associated with the overall description of the field, where both participants competed. In this sentence, the emphasis is on John Anderson and his achievements. Consequently, while both sentences discuss the participation of Paul Jessup and John Anderson in an unspecified field or event in 1928, the achievements attributed to each athlete are swapped between the sentences. So, the two sentences do not convey the same information."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

How is \\"That is also a pre-condition for the External Action Service to start operating very soon.\\" said in Finnish?","completion":"In Finnish, \\"That is also a pre-condition for the External Action Service to start operating very soon.\\" can be translated as \\"Se on myös edellytys Ulkoasiainhallinnon palvelun aloittamiselle hyvin pian.\\" Here is a breakdown of the translation: - \\"That\\" is translated into Finnish as \\"Se.\\" - \\"is also\\" can be translated as \\"on myös.\\" - \\"a pre-condition\\" refers to a state or fact that must exist or happen before something else can exist or happen. In Finnish, this phrase can be translated as \\"edellytys.\\" - \\"for the External Action Service,\\" an EU institution responsible for foreign affairs, would be \\"Ulkoasiainhallinnon palvelun\\" in Finnish. Please note that in Finland, due to the regular usage of compound words, \\"External Action Service\\" is translated as one single entity - \\"Ulkoasiainhallinnon palvelu.\\" - \\"to start\\" can be translated as \\"aloittamiselle,\\" which is the translative form of the word \\"aloittaa.\\" - \\"operating\\" can be translated as \\"toimiminen,\\" the act of operating or functioning; - \\"very soon\\" can be translated as \\"hyvin pian.\\" It is also worth noting that the phrase structure in Finnish is quite different from English because it is an agglutinative language, meaning most words are formed by joining morphemes together. Finnish does not generally use prepositions like English does. Instead, these relationships are usually expressed by inflections of the noun. This is why in the translation, \\"for the External Action Service to start\\" becomes \\"Ulkoasiainhallinnon palvelun aloittamiselle\\". The inflection \\"-lle\\" at the end of \\"aloittamiselle\\" conveys the meaning of \\"for\\" in this context. Furthermore, Finnish is an SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) language like English but, unlike English, it also allows for flexibility in sentence structure due to its heavy use of cases and suffixes. This is why the translation might sound a bit different structurally but still conveys the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

To provide an appropriate and detailed response to the original question, we should focus on what Tracy might do or think after asking Jan to take something from the store even though it is illegal. This could involve several possibilities such as whether Tracy will feel guilty for her actions, plan to commit more such acts, or consider if she should continue encouraging Jan for similar activities in the future. Instead, a more appropriate response that aligns with the question would be: Tracy may want to ensure Jan is successful in taking the item from the store without getting caught. She might also be on the lookout for any potential consequences that might arise from their actions. Depending on Tracy's plans and motivations, she may either try to help Jan avoid detection or plan their next steps after acquiring the item.

Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to replace a bicycle tire Loosen the nuts that hold the axle to the frame. If they are extremely tight, spray some lubricant on the nuts-a silicone lubricant or even vegetable oil will do the trick very well. ( many modern bikes will not have nuts.","completion":"Instead, they have a quick-release mechanism, which consists of a lever, skewer, and end nut; to loosen these, simply flip the quick-release lever to the \\"open\\" position and unscrew the end nut slightly if necessary, then pull the lever outward to free the bike's axle from the frame.) Once the nuts or quick-release mechanism are loosened, carefully lift the bike to elevate the wheel you want to replace, ensuring that it is no longer in contact with the ground. Next, disengage the brakes by either releasing the brake arm's anchor bolt or unhooking the noodle end from the brake arm slot, depending on the type of brakes your bicycle has. With the brakes disengaged, gently slide the wheel out of the fork or frame's dropouts, taking care not to damage the derailleur or any other components. Before proceeding to remove the tire from the wheel, inspect the wheel for any damage, such as bent, cracked, or loose spokes, which may need addressing before you reinstall the wheel on your bike. If everything appears to be in order, deflate the tire by pressing down on the inner tube valve, either with your finger or a valve adapter if necessary. Once the tire is deflated, use tire levers or your hands to gently pry one side of the tire bead up and over the wheel rim, working your way around until the entire bead is free from the rim. Then, follow the same procedure to remove the other side of the tire. Now, you may carefully pull the inner tube out of the tire. Before installing a new tire or inner tube, it's essential to double-check the inside of the tire for any remaining debris (such as glass) or thorns that may have punctured the inner tube initially. You may use your fingers, a rag, or a gentle brush to check and clean the tire's interior. Once you've ensured the tire is debris-free, slightly inflate your new inner tube – just enough to give it shape and make it easier to install. Insert the valve of the inner tube through the hole in the rim first, then gently tuck the rest of the tube into the tire. Starting with the tire bead that is opposite the valve, gradually push it back over the rim, ensuring that the tube isn't being pinched anywhere. Work your way around the wheel, pressing the bead into place and making sure the inner tube is seated entirely within the tire. Lastly, inflate your new tire to the recommended pressure indicated on the sidewall of the tire using a tire pump. Once the tire is fully inflated, ensure that the wheel spins smoothly and there are no bulges or misaligned sections of the tire. To reassemble the wheel onto your bike, follow the earlier steps in reverse order: carefully align and slide the wheel's axle back into the frame or fork dropouts, making sure the brake rotor (if applicable) fits into the brake caliper slot, and that the chain is draped over the cassette cog if it's the rear wheel. Tighten the axle nuts or close the quick-release mechanism, ensuring the wheel is secure and properly aligned. Reengage the brakes by tightening the brake arm's anchor bolt or rehooking the noodle end, and you're ready to go – with a brand-new tire to help you ride smoothly and comfortably, wherever your biking adventures may take you."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the information provided, Preston North End was the first club to achieve this feat in 1889. They managed to win both the Football League, which was the top-tier league in England at that time, and the FA Cup in the same season, thus completing the double. The Football League was formed in 1888, and the FA Cup was first held in 1871. The FA Cup is a prestigious knockout competition in English football, open to clubs from various levels of the English football league system. Over the years, achieving the League and Cup double has been considered a remarkable accomplishment, given the intense competition and crowded schedules that football clubs face during the season. Following Preston North End, six other clubs have managed to win the FA Cup as part of a League and Cup double, as mentioned in the statement. Aston Villa was the next club to do so in 1897, followed by Tottenham Hotspur in 1961.

It is important to note that these doubles consist of winning the FA Cup along with the Premier League or its predecessor, the First Division of the Football League.

To find 'o', we'll divide both sides by -12: o = -96 / -12 When we divide -96 by -12, we find out that: o = 8 So, the solution to the math problem is o = 8.

If your trash service collects the garbage infrequently, you might worry about it getting stinky with dog poo. Even when the poo is wrapped up in bags, the scent can be quite powerful, especially in the summer. You can solve this problem by investing in a smaller, separate trash can specifically for dog waste. Ensure it has a lid. Place a liner in it as you would with any other can, but leave it outside, and empty it into your larger trash bin when your trash collection service arrives. If your trash tends to be relatively stinky even without the addition of dog waste, there is little to be gained from utilizing a separate trash can just for dog waste. If you don't want to dispose of your bagged dog waste in a separate can, place it in your primary garbage bin (the big one that sits by the curb). A pet waste digester is a device that breaks dog poo down into a safe, biodegradable liquid that is then absorbed by your yard. To use the device, simply drop the waste in the opening, add warm water, and add the digestive agent. The exact amount of water and digestive agent required depends on the pet waste digester model you have. Installation is relatively easy, but does require you to dig a shallow hole (usually about one cubic foot) in your yard. This allows the liquefied poo to release slowly into the yard without pooling onto the grass. Always follow manufacturer directions when using your pet waste digester. In its natural state, dog poop is not a good fertilizer, as it contains harmful bacteria and (potentially) parasites. New technologies, however, allow you to ferment your dog poo using commercially available kits. The fermentation process will remove the toxic elements and leave behind nutrient-rich soil. The basic process involves mixing a fermentive accelerant, a dry mix, and water in specific amounts, then adding poo to a small bucket. After the bucket is full, dig a small hole in your yard and poor the mixture in. Cover with soil. After about two weeks, the poo will be completely transformed to healthy soil. Pet waste fermenting systems are available in a few stores on the west coast, but can be easily ordered online. Don't use dog poo fertilizer on plants that are intended for human consumption. Many cities ban pet waste in human toilets since waste water systems cannot properly process it. It's best to err on the side of caution and put your dog poo in the garbage. Alternately, if you want to do some investigating, contact your local Department of Health or Municipal Waste Department and find out if it is possible to flush dog poop down the toilet. If your local waste water system allows pet poop, you could use flushable poop bags. These bags are specially designed to break down when they come in contact with water.","completion":"This article discusses various methods for dealing with dog waste, including using a separate trash can, pet waste digesters, fermenting it into fertilizer, or potentially flushing it down the toilet depending on local regulations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given these facts, some flowers become an adaptation for what among the following options: - genetic diversity - Reproduction - insects - seed dispersal - Plant reproduction - seed cracking - seed destruction - seed withering A:","completion":"Some flowers become an adaptation for plant reproduction and seed dispersal among the given options. I will provide a detailed explanation to support this answer. Flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, display a wide variety of reproductive structures called flowers. These flowers are specifically designed for efficient reproduction by attracting pollinators and ensuring the processes of pollination and fertilization occur. Pollination refers to the transfer of pollen grains from the male reproductive part of the flower (anther) to the female reproductive part (stigma). After successful pollination, fertilization takes place, which then leads to the formation of seeds. In many cases, flowers develop into fruits, which are structures that contain seeds and act as an adaptation for seed dispersal. Seed dispersal is a process through which plants can spread their offspring and ensure that they colonize new environments. Different plant species have evolved various mechanisms for seed dispersal, such as wind, water, animals, and even ballistic means (where they forcibly eject their seeds). Now, looking at the options provided: 1. Genetic diversity: While genetic diversity is an essential aspect of successful reproduction in plants, it is not the primary adaptation related to the transformation of flowers into fruits. Rather, genetic diversity arises from the combination of genetic materials during fertilization, leading to the development of new plants with different genetic characteristics. 2. Reproduction: Flowers do indeed play a vital role in plant reproduction, but it is not the main adaptation achieved by turning flowers into fruits. 3. Insects: Insects are often involved in the process of pollination when they act as pollinators. However, they are not the main adaptation related to the transformation of flowers into fruits. 4. Seed dispersal: As explained above, fruits develop from flowers as an adaptation to ensure efficient seed dispersal. 5. Plant reproduction: Flowers, the initial reproductive structures, play a key role in plant reproduction. However, the subsequent development of fruits from those flowers makes it an essential adaption that further aids in the successful reproduction and sustenance of plant species by providing protection, nourishment, and efficient dispersion of seeds. 6. Seed cracking, seed destruction, and seed withering: These options refer to factors potentially detrimental to seed survival. As such, they are not related to how flowers become adaptations when transforming into fruits. In conclusion, the transformation of some flowers into fruits is an adaptation primarily related to seed dispersal and plant reproduction. These adaptations are vital to the successful continuation of plant species and their ability to colonize new environments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A Baltimore Orioles fan got an unexpected surprise when he stopped to help a motorist trapped in an overturned truck and realized the man helping him was one of his sporting idols. Diehard Orioles fan Mike Soukup was driving southbound on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway on Monday afternoon when he saw the accident and decided to pull over and help. Soukup, 55, started to help one man try to push the truck back on its wheels and after four or five others joined in they were able to get the truck upright. Baltimore Orioles fan Mike Soukup, right, got an unexpected surprise when he stopped to help a motorist trapped in an overturned truck and realized the man helping him was his sporting idols, Chris Davis. When Soukup turned to congratulate the achievement with the man next to him - the one who was the first on the scene - he recognized him as Orioles corner infielder Chris Davis. 'I turned to high five the guy for a good job done getting this truck up, and I thought to myself, \\"Man, that looks like Chris Davis,\\"' Soukup told The Baltimore Sun. Davis received a 25-game suspension on Friday for a second failed drug test for an amphetamine that he later revealed was Adderall. 'When I said, \\"Chris?\\" and he said, \\"Yeah,\\" back, he did it as if I was saying it to my best friend Bob,' said Soukup. Soukup posted about the chance meeting with one of his sporting idols on his Facebook page. 'He was a real nice guy. He talked to everybody. He talked to the EMTs. But he should wear the No. 19 all the time just so we can tell.' Medics transported three individuals to Maryland Shock Trauma Center and a 61-year-old man was transported to Shock Trauma with serious injuries that were not considered life threatening. Soukup, a local musician who lives in Severn, also told Davis he thought he got 'screwed' by Major League Baseball, and he said Davis told him he appreciated his sentiment. 'He’s pretty much my favorite Oriole. He seems to be a real nice humble guy who just happens to hit a ball really far. 'I was supposed to make more stops on my way home, but I thought, I can’t. I’ve got to go home and tell my wife about this because my cell phone wasn’t working.' A spokesman for the Orioles confirmed that Davis was listed as a witness in a police report and signed a statement about what happened. Davis received a 25-game suspension on Friday for a second failed drug test for an amphetamine he later revealed was Adderall. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Diehard Baltimore Orioles fan, Mike Soukup, was driving on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway when he noticed an overturned truck and decided to pull over to help.

Let's break down the phrase and analyze the emotions and sentiments associated with its various components. 1. \\"Biting the hand\\": This expression refers to an action that shows ingratitude or betrayal towards someone who provides help or support. This phrase generally has negative connotations, indicating that the person being described is acting selfishly and disregarding the efforts or kindness of others. 2. \\"That has finally\\": The use of the term \\"finally\\" implies that the warming up process has taken a considerable amount of time, perhaps indicating an initial reluctance or hesitance. This addition to the phrase highlights that the situation has changed for the better, but it could also suggest an element of surprise or skepticism given the previous conditions. 3. \\"To some extent\\": This phrase indicates that the change in behavior or attitude is not complete or fully satisfying. It provides a sense of reservation and suggests that the support or warmth being provided is limited and may not be wholehearted. 4. \\"Warmed up to him\\": The expression \\"warming up to someone\\" means becoming friendlier, more accepting, or more supportive towards that person. This part of the sentence carries a generally positive sentiment, demonstrating that the person in question has made progress in building a relationship or gaining acceptance from others. Overall, when combining these elements, the sentiment of the sentence conveys a sense of disappointment and skepticism. While there has been a positive change in the form of someone warming up to the individual in question, the person being described still reacts ungratefully and unappreciatively, effectively harming their relationship. As a result, the sentiment would likely be perceived as negative, with the focus on the subject's lack of gratitude and their inability to fully embrace the support or warmth from others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Storm) is a Japanese boy band consisting of five members formed under the Johnny & Associates talent agency. The members are Ohno Satoshi, Sakurai Sho, Aiba Masaki, Ninomiya Kazunari, and Matsumoto Jun. Arashi officially formed on September 15, 1999, in Honolulu, Hawaii, and made their debut CD on November 3, 1999. The group was initially signed to Pony Canyon and released one studio album and six singles--beginning with their 1999 eponymous debut single before moving to the Johnny's subsidiary label J Storm in 2001, which was initially set up for their succeeding releases. Arashi began 2002 by releasing their first single under J Storm. \\"A Day in Our Life\\" was used as the theme song for Sakurai's comedy drama Kisarazu Cat's Eye and debuted atop of the Oricon weekly singles chart selling 226,480 copies. Their subsequent releases of the year, \\"Nice na Kokoroiki\\" and \\"Pikanchi\\", were used as the theme songs for the anime Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Koen-mae Hashutsujo and Arashi's movie Pikanchi Life is Hard Dakedo Happy (pikanchi Life is HarddakedoHappy, Pikanchi Life is Hard But Happy) respectively. Starting in 2003, the group would only release two singles every year until 2007. Both singles released in 2003, \\"Tomadoi Nagara\\" and \\"Hadashi no Mirai/Kotoba Yori Taisetsu na Mono\\", debuted at number two on the charts. The song \\"Kotoba Yori Taisetsu na Mono\\" marked the first time a member contributed to the penning of a single, as many of the group's songs are produced by other lyricists, composers, or musicians. Sakurai, who is the designated rapper of Arashi, has since written all the incorporated rap lyrics of the group's releases. 2004 was Arashi's fifth anniversary since debut. They began the year by releasing their twelfth single, \\"Pikanchi Double\\", in February as the theme song for their second movie Pikanchi Life is Hard Dakara Happy (pikanchi Life is HarddakaraHappy, Pikanchi Life is Hard Thus Happy). Selling 89,106 copies in the first week, it is Arashi's lowest-selling single to date. In celebration of their anniversary, the group released a greatest hits album 5x5 The Best Selection of 2002-2004, which included their second 2004 single \\"Hitomi no Naka no Galaxy/Hero\\". In 2005, on New Year's Day, Arashi released their first concert DVD since How's It Going? in 2003 titled 2004 Arashi! Iza, Now Tour!!. From July 26 to August 24, they embarked on a summer tour titled One to support their album of the same name. One of the highlights of the tour included the live performance their first single of the year, \\"Sakura Sake\\", on top of \\"Johnny's Moving Stage\\" (ziyanizumubingusutezi, Janizu Mubingu Suteji), a transparent stage that travels over the top of the audience. Invented by Matsumoto, \\"Johnny's Moving Stage\\" has since been used in a majority of Arashi's concerts to allow them to move closer to the audience seated at a distance from the main stage. In November, Arashi released a theme song for the manga-based drama Hana Yori Dango, which starred Matsumoto as one of the lead actors. \\"Wish\\" went on to sell an estimated 178,000 copies in its first week and over 300,000 copies by the end of its chart run, making it their first single to sell over 300,000 copies in total in nearly three years since \\"A Day in Our Life\\" in 2002.

He wrote the #2 Billboard hit, \\"The Rapper\\", with the Jaggerz in 1970 and was a member of Wild Cherry after the group had a #1 hit with \\"Play That Funky Music.\\" He also achieved fame as a solo artist in the early 1980s with the #29 hit \\"Ah! Leah!\\" Dominic Ierace was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, but grew up in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania. The son of father Sam and mother Carrie Ierace, young Dominic began to learn how to sing at an early age from his mother, who had sung in Curly Venezie's orchestra. He practiced earlier on by singing along with his mother's favorite singers, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett. Per his mother's encouragement, Ierace began singing at weddings at age five, and by eight was performing on local television and entering talent contests. Over time, Ierace began to develop his own interests in music with the advent of rock music, drawing inspiration from Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly and later from the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and even R&B and soul artists Marvin Gaye and Ray Charles in addition to other Motown acts. The popularity of rock and roll inspired Ierace to become a self-taught guitarist. When his voice changed around age 12, he gave up singing and took up the drums. About the time he was a senior in high school (circa 1961), Ierace's voice changed again, and he got back into singing. He formed a vocal doo-wop group called the Fabutons with Johnny Roth, Anthony Matteo, Lou Delessandro and Chuckie Hasson and performed gigs around Beaver and Lawrence counties in Pennsylvania. However, the group only performed a few times before they disbanded and Ierace went to college. While attending Slippery Rock State College, Ierace formed a band called the Tri-Vels with guitarist Jim Evans and drummer Dave Amodie, two fellow students at Slippery Rock. With the addition of bassist Dave Reiser, they renamed themselves Donnie and the Donnells. This band in both incarnations played R&B and pop rock covers at fraternity parties and lasted from about 1961 to 1964.

What is the answer?","completion":"The 'Reign of Terror', also known as 'The Terror,' was a particularly violent political period that took place in France during the years 1793-94. It was amidst the turbulence of the French Revolution, which lasted from 1789 to 1799. The Reign of Terror was characterized by a series of chaotic, bloody, and ruthless measures taken against perceived enemies of the French Republic, leading to mass executions and rampant persecution. The French Revolution began in 1789 due to widespread social and political discontent in France. The nation was facing economic hardships, and the governance under King Louis XVI was marked by injustice and inequality. The revolution aimed to establish a more egalitarian society by dismantling the existing feudal system and monarchical power. The radical revolutionary movement, marked by the fall of the Bastille prison in July 1789, sought to change the ancien régime radically and implement new political, social, and economic reforms. Despite early successes, such as the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, the revolution became increasingly unstable. As new radical factions emerged, internal and external conflicts intensified. France found itself at war with several European countries, including Austria, Prussia, and Great Britain, which saw the revolution as a potentially contagious threat to their own monarchical systems. Simultaneously, counter-revolutionary groups within France sought to preserve or restore the pre-revolutionary status quo. The Reign of Terror unfolded in this context of mounting chaos and paranoia. At its helm were the radical Jacobins, led by Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton, and Jean-Paul Marat, who came to power by overthrowing the moderate Girondin faction within France's National Convention. The Jacobins instituted the Committee of Public Safety, which acted as a de-facto government, implementing harsh measures to ensure the revolution's progress. During the Reign of Terror, thousands of perceived enemies of the revolution were arrested, tortured, and executed, many by guillotine. Victims included royalists, moderates, rival revolutionary factions, and, eventually, even original Jacobin leaders such as Danton and Desmoulins. At the height of this brutal period, between June and July of 1794, an event called the Great Terror saw nearly 1,400 executions in Paris alone. The Reign of Terror finally ended on July 27, 1794, with the fall of Robespierre, who was arrested, condemned to death, and guillotined. His execution marked a significant shift in the French Revolution, leading to the decline of radicalism and the beginning of the more conservative phase known as the Thermidorean Reaction. Ultimately, the French Revolution would lead to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte and the establishment of the Napoleonic era, which further transformed France and Europe at large. In summary, the Reign of Terror took place in France between 1793 and 1794 during the French Revolution. A radical period marked by extreme violence, political persecutions, and mass executions, it was led by the Jacobin faction under the influence of Robespierre, Danton, and Marat. Although it eventually came to an end with Robespierre's fall, the Reign of Terror's ruthless legacy remains a critical part of French revolutionary history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Which islands does Pindus last meet?\\" Context: \\"The Pindus range continues through the central Peloponnese, crosses the islands of Kythera and Antikythera and finds its way into southwestern Aegean, in the island of Crete where it eventually ends. The islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland. Pindus is characterized by its high, steep peaks, often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes. The spectacular Vikos Gorge, part of the Vikos-Aoos National Park in the Pindus range, is listed by the Guinness book of World Records as the deepest gorge in the world. Another notable formation are the Meteora rock pillars, atop which have been built medieval Greek Orthodox monasteries.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"According to the given context, the Pindus range, which is characterized by its high, steep peaks and a variety of karstic landscapes, extends through various parts of Greece, covering different regions, and spanning across several islands. After traversing through the central Peloponnese, the Pindus range crosses two key islands, Kythera and Antikythera. Kythera is located at the southern tip of the Peloponnese, and Antikythera lies to the north-west of Kythera, acting as a bridge between Kythera and Crete. After Kythera and Antikythera, the Pindus range reaches its final destination in the southwestern part of the Aegean Sea - the island of Crete. Crete, the largest and most populous of the Greek islands, is where the Pindus range meets its end. Thus, based on the contextual information provided, the islands that Pindus last meets are Kythera, Antikythera, and finally, Crete. It's interesting to note that these islands - Kythera, Antikythera, and Crete - are actually peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland. This is reflective of the extensive and geologically diverse landscape that the Pindus range covers, inclusive of everything from the spectacular Vikos Gorge, which holds the Guinness World Record as the deepest gorge in the world, to the Meteora rock pillars, atop which medieval Greek Orthodox monasteries have been erected. The Pindus range, therefore, is not only geographically expansive but also rich in natural beauty and cultural significance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn.

Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said.

Suarez has until Friday at midday GMT to appeal against punishment. Liverpool \\"shocked and disappointed\\" at decision.","completion":"Title: Liverpool Striker Luis Suarez Receives 10-Game Ban, Liverpool Expresses Shock and Disappointment Introduction: The English Football Association has delivered a significant judgment on one of the Premier League's most controversial stars. Liverpool striker Luis Suarez has been hit with a 10-game ban for a biting incident involving Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. This decision has sparked a range of reactions, with both Suarez and Liverpool voicing bewilderment and disappointment. Step 1: Analyze the incident To begin, it is crucial to understand the nature of the incident that led to this 10-match suspension. During a tense game on the weekend, Suarez sank his teeth into Branislav Ivanovic's arm during a tussle for the ball. The fact that this is not Suarez's first offense of a similar nature means it is necessary to explore whether the English Football Association's decision is reasonable or too harsh. Step 2: Highlight the context of previous offenses It should be mentioned that this is not the first time the Uruguayan forward has faced a lengthy ban in his career. In November 2010, Suarez bit PSV Eindhoven player, Otman Bakkal, and received a seven-game ban while playing for Ajax. Suarez has also faced an eight-game suspension in 2011 after being found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. Step 3: Explore reactions to the punishment The decision to issue a 10-game ban has left Liverpool \\"shocked and disappointed.\\" It appears the club had anticipated a lesser punishment, which would allow Suarez to continue playing an essential role in the team's bid to qualify for European competition next season. The club further outlined that it would thoroughly review the decision before deciding on an appropriate response. Step 4: Discuss Suarez's opportunity to appeal The English Football Association has given Suarez until Friday at midday GMT to appeal against the punishment. This timeframe provides the player and Liverpool ample opportunity to explore their options and potentially challenge the decision if deemed appropriate. Step 5: Explore implications of the ban If Suarez's 10-match ban remains in place, it will have significant ramifications for both the player and his club. As a key figure within the Liverpool squad, Suarez's absence could harm the team's chances of securing a European spot for the coming season. Additionally, the ban serves as a stark reminder that physical altercations and unsportsmanlike behavior have no place within the sport. Conclusion: The 10-game ban handed to Luis Suarez has sparked a turbulent period for the player and his club, Liverpool. Although Suarez's history of aggressive behavior may justify this punishment, Liverpool's shock and disappointment highlight the complexities surrounding the case. With the option to appeal still on the table, the coming days will prove pivotal in determining Suarez's immediate future within the Premier League."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Atahualpa was saluted as a hero; when recapturing Cajamarca, making camp outside the city with some 40,000 troops while Chalcuchimac and Quizquiz chased Huáscar's army south. With a disastrous northern campaign, Huáscar had not only lost his best generals and many soldiers, but his army was shocked and demoralized. Huascar and Atahualpa's armies met. Huáscar, after finding himself in a dominant position, refused to make use of it, opting for a safe retreat, crossing the Cotabambas River on the way to Cuzco. Chalkuchimac had a plan of his own and predicted the action of Topa Atao, and divided his army in two, sending one contingent around Topa Atao's back, enveloping and destroying the defenders. In January 1532, only miles from Cuzco, Huáscar's retreat was cut off at Quipaipan, and his army was annihilated and disbanded. Huáscar was captured and the capital Cuzco was seized by Quizquiz, who had it purged from Huáscar's supporters in a bloody massacre. Huáscar himself was executed the following year. During the course of the war, Atahualpa's army had grown to 250,000 men, all the strength of the Empire. However, before he could leave Cajamarca, the new king encountered conquistador Francisco Pizarro, who had reached the city on 16 November, and Atahualpa was captured in the ensuing Battle of Cajamarca. In the custody of Pizarro, Atahualpa was told by Pizarro that he would bring Huáscar to Cajamarca and Pizarro would judge which brother was the better Sapa Inca. In response, Atahualpa ordered Huáscar killed allegedly by drowning. Only months later on August 29, 1533, Atahualpa was himself garroted at the plaza of Cajamarca by Pizarro's men.

As the stagecoach driver refuses to take him any further, Renfield continues on foot despite turning back. Renfield meets Count Dracula, a charming but rather strange man who is a vampire. He then casts a hypnotic spell on the highly suggestible Renfield, making him his slave. Dracula and Renfield soon embark for England. During the voyage, Dracula dines upon the ship's crew. When the ship arrives and Renfield, (by this time raving mad in the style of Dwight Frye), is discovered alone on the ship, he is confined to a lunatic asylum. Meanwhile, Dracula visits an opera house, where he introduces himself to his new neighbors: Doctor Seward, (the lunatic asylum's administrator and head psychiatrist, who is obsessed with prescribing his patients enemas), Mina (Seward's nubile daughter), Jonathan Harker (Seward's assistant and Mina's fiance), and Lucy (Seward's equally nubile ward). Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, enters her bedroom and feeds on her blood. Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing informs the skeptical Dr. Seward that Lucy has been attacked by a vampire. After some hesitation, Seward and Harker allow garlic to be placed in Lucy's bedroom to repel the vampire. After a failed attempt by Renfield to remove the garlic, Dracula uses mind-control to make Lucy leave her room, and kills her. Despite Van Helsing's warnings, Seward refuses to believe him.

However, I can provide a step-by-step guide on how to clean a television screen. 1. Gather the necessary supplies: To clean your television screen, you will need a soft microfiber cloth and a screen cleaner solution that is specifically designed for electronics. Do not use harsh chemicals or abrasive cloths as they may damage the screen. 2. Turn off the TV: Ensure the television is turned off before cleaning. This will allow you to see the dust and smudges more clearly and avoid any possible electrical hazards. 3. Dust the screen: Gently wipe the screen with the dry microfiber cloth to remove any loose dust or debris. Be sure to clean the entire surface of the screen, moving in either horizontal or vertical strokes. Do not apply heavy pressure as it may damage the TV screen. 4. Apply the screen cleaner: Spray a small amount of the cleaner onto the microfiber cloth—not directly onto the screen. Spraying directly on the screen can cause the cleaner to drip into the electronics, which can be harmful. 5. Wipe the screen gently: Gently wipe the screen with the dampened microfiber cloth, using either horizontal or vertical strokes. Be sure to avoid applying excessive pressure. 6. Dry the screen: If after cleaning there is any excess moisture on the screen, use a dry section of the microfiber cloth to gently dry the surface to prevent streaks or damage. 7. Clean the frame: If needed, you can also use the same microfiber cloth to gently wipe the frame of the television. For more thorough cleaning, refer to your TV's manufacturer instructions.

George's sheriff's officials accused in theft from union A grand jury charged two Prince George's County sheriff's officials Thursday with conspiring to steal more than 20,000 from the deputies' union when they were officers for the organization. The criminal indictment was brought by State Prosecutor Robert A. Rohrbaugh. According to the indictment, Wendy Tyler, who until Thursday was an acting sheriff's captain, served as president of the union that represents deputies from September 2005 to October 2007. Capt. Nancy Ridgely was first vice president of the union for the same term, the indictment says. During those two years, Tyler was entitled to receive quarterly checks totaling 10,400 from the Prince George's County Deputy Sheriff's Association, Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #112, the indictment says. Tyler instead received 13 union checks for 22,124, the indictment says. The union requires the signature of two officers to draw checks on the union's bank account, according to the indictment. Ridgely signed 12 of the 13 checks paid to Tyler, the indictment says. Ridgely, who supervises the sheriff's department's public information office, did not return a phone call. Tyler, who had been working as an acting captain in the department's domestic violence unit, also did not return a phone call. William C. Brennan, Ridgely's attorney, said, \\"My client adamantly denies these allegations and will vigorously contest these charges.\\" Sheriff Michael Jackson, a candidate in the Democratic primary for county executive, did not return phone calls. Col. Paul A. Drula, Jackson's second-in-command, said, \\"As we've said before, it's a union issue involving union funds, not government funds. It's between union members.\\" Tyler and Ridgely will be placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the charges, Drula said. During her leave, Tyler will revert to the rank of lieutenant, Drula said. The indictment also accuses Tyler of making purchases of more than 10,000 for nonunion purposes with her union-issued credit card. The bills for those personal purchases were paid for with union funds, the indictment says.

Question: This article: The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Puerto Rico gov dares GOP to pass highly restrictive bill Puerto Rico’s financial crisis escalated early Wednesday morning as Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla won an emergency declaration from both houses of the Puerto Rican legislature authorizing him to suspend all payment on 72 billion in public debt. The sudden move stunned both Washington and Wall Street, where leaders keep ignoring Puerto Rico’s pleas to be allowed to restructure its debts. CONGRESS MULLS OVER 72B PUERTO RICO DEBT RESCUE METHOD The governor’s action came after hedge funds holding Puerto Rico bonds sued Monday in federal district court in San Juan to freeze assets of the island’s government development bank. With his government almost out of cash and facing huge debt payments of 422 million on May 1 and nearly 2 billion on July 1, Garcia Padilla is now forcing everyone’s hand. Around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, he won approval from Puerto Rico’s Senate for a debt moratorium until next January. The bill authorizes the governor to “protect the health, security and public welfare” of island residents by using government funds first and foremost for public services. The proposal then moved to the lower house, where a debate ensued for much of day, with financial industry lobbyists feverishly pressing legislators to oppose it. Around 1 a.m. Wednesday, members of Garcia Padilla’s ruling Popular Democratic Party passed their own version of the bill by a narrow one-vote majority. It authorizes the governor to suspend any debt payment on a case-by-case basis and also to appoint a new chief financial officer. The governor was expected to immediately sign the law. This sudden act of defiance should come as no surprise. Late last year, Republicans in Congress refused to include a rescue package for Puerto Rico in a year-end federal spending bill. House Speaker Paul Ryan failed to pass a bill by March 31 to address the problem as he promised. Republican leaders in the House Natural Resources Committee did finally issue a draft proposal last week. But its provisions outraged many Puerto Rican leaders. The financial control board it would create for Puerto Rico would enjoy unprecedented powers over island affairs. “Its real name should be the Omnipresent, Dictatorial and Colonial Board,” said former Gov. Anibal Acevedo Vila. A good portion of the House bill is modeled on the 1995 financial control board Congress created for the District of Columbia’s financial problems. But there’s a big difference between D.C. and Puerto Rico. The district is a city, one that depends directly on Congress for big part of its budget, while Puerto Rico is an entire territory with its own Constitution and is supposed to be self-governing. “The people of Puerto Rico have complete autonomy in internal economic matters and in cultural and social affairs,” the U.S. State Department told the United Nations back in 1953, when Washington urged removing Puerto Rico from the UN’s list of colonies. “With the establishment of the commonwealth, neither the President nor the United States Senate participates in any way in the appointment of any official of the government of the commonwealth,” the State Department said then. But now the Republicans want to trample on those 60-year-old assurances. The House bill would authorize the President of the United States to appoint a five-member oversight board “as an entity within the government of Puerto Rico,” with only one member even having to reside on the island. For the next five years, that board could approve or reject any budget or law proposed by the island’s elected officials. It could subpoena any records. It could privatize any government service. It could approve any contract over 1 million. It could create a subminimum wage. It could also petition to restructure any debts to bondholders and decide how those debts would be repaid. It could pass any rules or orders to carry out its work without judicial review. The President would have to name four members from a list supplied by congressional leaders. So you could well have a Republican-dominated board of U.S. residents running Puerto Rico’s economy and government for at least five years. That’s dictatorship, pure and simple. No wonder Garcia Padilla has dared to defy both Washington and Wall Street.","completion":"As we noted, earlier this week Puerto Rico's Governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, declared a government bank debt moratorium; the move allows him to suspend all payments on 72bn in public debt.

Negative: Title: \\"Trials of Disarray\\" \\"Trials of Disarray\\" had the potential to become a thought-provoking allegory, but unfortunately, it falls far short in delivering on its promises. The movie enters the bumpy terrain of a dystopian future, where individuality is seen as a threat and citizens are controlled by a central regime. While the premise may have been unoriginal, the lack of richly drawn characters, compelling storytelling, and clear themes bring this film to a screeching halt. To begin with, the lead character, Alex, played by Terry Haskell, lacked depth and motivation. Instead of capitalizing on this opportunity to display the struggle against the regime, Haskell's portrayal came across as wooden, his actions almost unmotivated, and his emotional range severely limited. The supporting characters were no better, merely filling in the gaps without contributing to the overall story. The script, clearly the weakest link of the film, faltered and wobbled through disjointed dialogues, unable to garner any profound moments or convey any thought-provoking themes. The complicated and poorly fleshed out storyline left the audience more confused than intrigued, as they endeavored to piece together the motives behind each character's actions. Visually, \\"Trials of Disarray\\" struggled to find its footing among powerful cinematography and low-grade special effects. The tensions between the action sequences and the quieter segments appeared forced and disjointed. It became increasingly difficult to immerse oneself in the dark and dreary world the movie sought to create as the CGI detracted from its realism. The musical score lacked variation and emotional impact, incapable of enhancing the dramatic moments or bolstering the story as it stumbling toward its conclusion. The crescendos, rather than evoking a surge of rebellion or tender emotion, fell flat and empty, struggling to find a footing in a film that lacked substance of its own. In conclusion, \\"Trials of Disarray\\" is a tangle of half-baked ideas, lost potential, and unexplored themes. It serves as a reminder of how the brilliance of an intriguing premise can be entirely undone with poor execution, ultimately leading to an unsatisfying cinematic experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Industry news source MCV is reporting that the PlayStation 4 shifted 250,000 units in the UK within 48 hours of its launch on Friday, smashing sales records for a new console. The Xbox One sold 150,000 machines in the UK during its own launch period following release on 22 November. The figure quoted by MCV comes from official industry sales monitor Chart-Track, which will have released it on Monday morning to subscribing publishers and retailers. It means the PS4 is now the UK's fastest selling console, beating the previous record-holder, the Sony PSP handheld, which shifted 185,000 units on its launch in 2005. It's also a long way ahead of the UK PlayStation 3 launch, which managed 165,000 units in 2007. Furthermore, Chart-Track software sales figures for last week show that the PS4 versions of most key multiplatform releases - including Battlefield 4 and Fifa 14 – outsold other platforms; apart from in the case of number one selling title Call of Duty: Ghosts, which shifted more copies on Xbox 360. The news will be especially sobering to Nintendo. The company's Wii U console, launched last November, managed sales of just 40,000 in its opening UK weekend. Regional year one sales for the beleaguered console have not yet been confirmed, but a retail source indicated to MCV that the figure for the UK is not much above 150,000 units. PlayStation 4 launch title Knack, which has attracted mediocre reviews, charted one place higher, at 13, than the critically acclaimed Super Mario 3D World. So how significant is this early victory? \\"All the way along Sony said that it would be pushing to get as many units out for launch as possible,\\" said MCV editor-in-chief, Michael French. \\"They really went for it and quite possibly managed a much higher production run than Xbox One. But the figures also reflect the very strong pre-orders and high demand for PS4, as well as the successful PR and all the goodwill that's built up for the machine.\\" Yet Microsoft has its own recent success to shout about. According to retail analyst InfoScout Xbox One was the best selling console in the US during the critical Black Friday with 31% of sales compared with PS4's 15%. However, InfoScout suggested this may have been down to the paucity of PlayStation 4 units remaining on store shelves after the machine's launch. \\"With regards to long-term outlook, I think it's a little foolhardy to read too deeply into launch sales of the new consoles,\\" said Piers Harding-Rolls, Head of Games at IHS Electronics and Media. \\"Both Xbox One and PS4 comfortably improved on sales of the prior generation consoles at launch in the UK, but that was expected because there are many more Xbox-brand console users now than in 2005 and PS4 is much more competitive on price compared to the PS3. Also people are eager for something new - it's been eight years since the Xbox 360 launched and the UK is experiencing some economic stability, so pent-up demand for both consoles has been high, even if the games on offer are not hugely compelling. \\"Looking at the comparison, PS4 stronger opening sales are a reflection of the lower price and perhaps a more active and engaged set of PlayStation consumers that have been won over during 10 months of very successful product positioning from Sony. Once past this opening adoption phase and into next year, we expect games and exclusives to become the key deciding factor for adoption alongside pricing.\\" Whatever the case, the figures are close and supply is no doubt playing a role at this early stage. \\"It's not until after Christmas, when stocks are up, that you can really compare statistics,\\" said French. \\"The real story, though, is that there is so much demand and excitement around these machines. It has been a long time since the last console cycle began. This has proved there is still a strong interest.\\" • Xbox One vs PlayStation 4: how do they compare?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. minimum payment: the producer has received a predetermined minimum payment that is above the cost of production. Make this proper case","completion":"Minimum Payment: The Producer Has Received a Predetermined Minimum Payment That Is Above the Cost of Production. Minimum Payment is a concept used in various industries, particularly in agriculture and creative fields, to ensure that the producer or creator receives a fair and predetermined payment for their work or products. This minimum payment is often set above the cost of production to guarantee that the producer can cover their expenses and maintain a sustainable business model. As a result, the Minimum Payment serves as a financial safety net for producers while promoting fair trade and encouraging ethical business practices. The establishment of a Minimum Payment is crucial for numerous reasons. Firstly, it guarantees the producer a consistent level of income, enabling them to further invest in their business, take risks, and innovate with new products or processes. This financial security can ultimately lead to higher quality products and services, benefitting both the producer and consumer in the long term. Secondly, it helps protect producers from potential price fluctuations and market volatility. By ensuring that their product pricing remains above the cost of production, they are less likely to suffer significant financial losses due to unforeseen economic shifts. Additionally, a Minimum Payment policy can contribute to creating a more equitable and just market environment by leveling the playing field for producers of various sizes and financial capacities. Smaller or less-established producers often struggle to break into the industry and gain market share, facing high levels of competition from larger, established businesses that can afford to sell products or services at lower prices due to economies of scale. By implementing a Minimum Payment, these small producers can gain a foothold in the market and thrive, simultaneously encouraging healthy competition, diversity, and innovation within the industry. Furthermore, Minimum Payment standards can have significant social and environmental benefits by encouraging ethical and sustainable business practices. For example, Fair Trade is an international movement that advocates for the implementation of Minimum Payments for producers, among other criteria, in order to support worker's rights, promote economic stability, and protect the environment. By adhering to these guidelines, producers can use their increased financial security to invest in providing fair wages, implementing environmentally friendly practices, and minimizing waste. In conclusion, the concept of Minimum Payment is a fundamental one for producers and creators who seek to earn a fair and adequate income while providing stable support for their business ventures. By establishing a predetermined payment level above the cost of production, producers can maintain their financial security, invest in their businesses, and promote ethical and sustainable practices, ultimately resulting in a more equitable and fair market for all parties involved."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The question itself is a simple inquiry seeking a description or identification of the subject, specifically of \\"that.\\" However, the question does not provide enough information to deliver a precise answer. The response \\"That is a blue dinosaur\\" indicates that the subject in question is a blue dinosaur.

For example, if a person is at an amusement park and points to a large blue dinosaur statue, then the answer \\"That is a blue dinosaur\\" would be appropriate. On the other hand, if the question is raised in a different context, the answer could vary significantly.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Why Microsoft’s CEO may have been right about asking for a raise Now that the witch-hunt has died down a bit, it might be time to cut Microsoft’s MSFT CEO a little slack. Last week, Satya Nadella made a controversial comment about women and pay. On stage at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, Maria Klawe – named one of the world’s 50 greatest leaders in Fortune for her work recruiting female engineering students as president of Harvey Mudd College—asked Nadella what advice he has for women uncomfortable with asking for pay raises. “It’s not really about asking for a raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will give you the right raise,” he responded. The crowd was noticeably alarmed by Nadella’s recommendation. Research shows that women are less likely to ask for a raise, which fuels the persistent gender wage gap. In 2013, female full-time workers were paid 78% of what men were paid. After a swarm of negative attention in the press and on social media, the CEO quickly recanted his statement. He acknowledged that he answered the question “completely wrong” and firmly stated that he believes men and women should get equal pay for equal work. “If you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask,” he wrote in a letter to employees. Yet Nadella’s second answer may be as ill advised as his first. Asking directly for a pay raise may be poor advice for workers regardless of their gender, say experts and several high-paid female execs. “You never ask for more money,” Victoria Medvec, the executive director of the Center for Executive Women at the Kellogg School of Management, said last week in a panel discussion at the 2014 Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit. “You ask for more of a package. As you go into a negotiation, you always make it about what you achieving for the business. The compensation should be at caboose of the offer. It is just along for the ride.” Medvec’s research focuses on judgment and decision-making. You are much more likely to get the outcome you want in a negotiation by focusing the offer on the other person and their needs, she says. You also want to be flexible in your request. By positioning the entire discussion on pay, you are forgoing the option of your employer giving you extra advances—in additional to your total compensation package. Christie Smith, a managing partner at Deloitte, always centers her negotiations on what problems she is solving for the business through her work. “Whenever I am in a place where I am thinking about myself and my pay, I am dead,” she said in the panel discussion with Medvec (which was prior to Nadella’s comment). Instead, Smith walks her manager through what revenue streams she has created for the business and focuses on other tangible wins. She says a title change and a pay increase naturally follow. That strategy seems to have worked for Mary Barra as well. The CEO of GM GM famously told Fortune in February that she has never asked for an increase in pay. Barra could earn as much as 14.4 million this year, if the Detroit automaker achieves certain goals. “I have always been motivated by the work I am doing and adding value,” Barra said in an on stage interview at the Summit. “I felt that if I did the right thing it would be recognized. I am not saying it is wrong to do, if something is in a specific situation, I just never faced that.” Interviewer Alan Murray, the editor of Fortune, then polled the audience of prominent female executives to see how many of them had never asked for a raise. A majority raised their hands. To be sure, there is value to the “lean-in” approach championed by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg of communicating clearly with your employer for the pay you deserve. In Lean In For Graduates, Sandberg outlines research that suggests women negotiate less frequently than men because they often underestimate their abilities and focus too much on pleasing others. “Becoming aware of the special challenges women face in negotiations is the first step to overcoming them,” writes Sandberg. “Sweet and upbeat can coexist with assertive.” Of course, there are some notable cases of powerhouse women advocating directly for more pay. In 2011, Chelsea Handler inked a 25 million two-year deal with E! network for her late night talk show. Her method to scoring the big contract was simple: She asked for it. “You have to ask for what you want. Just because there are parameters that have been set doesn’t mean they can’t be blown open,” she told the audience at the 2011 Fortune MPW Summit. There are plenty of ways female (and male) professionals can approach negotiations. But a request for a pay raise will go nowhere without the substance—and success—to support the ask.

Islamic political philosophy, was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of Islam—i.e., the Qur'an and the Sunnah, the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in the Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: al-Kindi (Alkindus), al-Farabi (Abunaser), İbn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Bajjah (Avempace), Ibn Rushd (Averroes), and Ibn Khaldun. The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), sultan, ummah, cemaa (obligation)-and even the \\"core\\" terms of the Qur'an—i.e., ibadah (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and ilah (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah, or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the Ehl-i Sunna and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character.

These clashes primarily stemmed from differing views on the rightful succession and leadership of the Muslim community after the death of Prophet Muhammad. The Ehl-i Sunna, or Sunni Muslims, believed that the leadership should be based on consensus among the community and the selection of a qualified individual, while the Shia Muslims believed that leadership should be passed down through the bloodline of Prophet Muhammad, specifically to his cousin and son-in-law, Ali ibn Abi Talib, and his descendants. This divergence in beliefs led to a series of conflicts and power struggles throughout Islamic history, which were deeply rooted in political ideologies and the quest for control over the Muslim community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Air Force, including Ace, is against the marriage. Ace and Joe have an argument during which Ace uses a racial slur to describe Katsumi. Ace eventually apologizes, then agrees to be Joe's best man at the wedding.

The other delegates, implore him to ('Sit Down, John')Adams' response is that Congress has done nothing for the last year ('Piddle, Twiddle, and Resolve'). He reads the latest missive from his loving wife Abigail, who, their home in Braintree, Massachusetts, appears in his imagination. He asks if she and the other women are making saltpeter for the war effort but she ignores that and states the women have a more urgent problem: no straight pins. They pledge their love to each other in song ('Till Then').Later that day, Adams finds delegate Benjamin Franklin outside. Adams bemoans the failure of his arguments for independence. Franklin suggests that, a resolution for independence would have more success if proposed by someone else. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia enters, having been summoned by Franklin. The cocky Lee crows that he is the best man to propose the resolution.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: This is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in, effected by, or suffering from an eating disorder. It is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl, its causes and its symptoms. The girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in cinema today, Alison Lohman, who was later so spectacular in 'Where the Truth Lies'. I would recommend that this film be shown in all schools, as you will never see a better on this subject. Alison Lohman is absolutely outstanding, and one marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. If barometers tell us the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy. Her emotional range is so precise, each scene could be measured microscopically for its gradations of trauma, on a scale of rising hysteria and desperation which reaches unbearable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother, and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions just as finely tuned as Lohman's. Together, they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with one another. This film is really an astonishing achievement, and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you like nature films best, this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair. And if we don't sympathise with people suffering from the depths of despair, then we are dead inside. Possible answers: [-] negative.

Does the sentence \\"An easy way to measure this is by noting the consonant's voice-onset time, as the voicing of a following vowel cannot begin until the vocal cords close.\\" answer the question \\"What is created when the vocal folds are spread and do not vibrate?\\"","completion":"The sentence provided does not directly answer the question, \\"What is created when the vocal folds are spread and do not vibrate?\\" The sentence given refers to a method for measuring the time it takes for the vocal cords to close and the voicing of a consonant, whereas the question asks for the result or product of non-vibrating vocal folds. Let's address the question directly. When the vocal folds (also known as vocal cords) are spread and do not vibrate, the sound produced is called an \\"unvoiced\\" or \\"voiceless\\" sound. This occurs because the air can pass through the vocal folds without any hindrance, causing no vibration, and thus, no vocalized pitch. In contrast, when the vocal folds come together while air is passing through, they vibrate, and a \\"voiced\\" sound is produced. Voiced sounds feature a distinct pitch, whereas voiceless sounds do not. In speech, some consonants are categorized as voiceless, meaning they are produced without vibration. It is important to differentiate between the two types of consonants to better understand how speech sounds are articulated. Examples of voiceless consonants in English include /p/, /t/, /k/, /f/, and /s/. Voiced consonants, on the other hand, are produced with vocal fold vibration, and examples include /b/, /d/, /g/, /v/, and /z/. To summarize, when the vocal folds are spread and do not vibrate, voiceless or unvoiced sounds are created. The sentence provided is related to some aspects of speech production, but it does not directly answer the question. The study of these different types of speech sounds and their production is essential to understanding the mechanics of human speech and language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have a new situation: Megan, a sophomore in college, is visiting her grandparents who live out of town. There is a party going on at her grandparents' house because her grandma, Emily, has just retired. There is cake and ice cream and people are talking about their jobs, and Emily is talking about all the good and bad memories she has from her work. But I can use this background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. What is an answer for this question: Who will have slower reflexes? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, it can be inferred that individuals in their old age, specifically those over 65, experience a decline in reflex time.

Step 1: Identify the ages of the individuals - Megan is a college sophomore. - Grandparents (grandma Emily included) are likely over 65. Step 2: Consider the provided background information on reflex time - Reflex time declines during old age (mid-60s and onwards). Step 3: Apply the background information to the individuals in the scenario - Megan's grandparents are in the age group where reflexes slow down.

Joseph asked Craig what to do with their dog, because Available options: (A). Joseph knew that they could not be objective about it.; (B). Craig knew that they could not be objective about it.;","completion":"Joseph asked Craig what to do with their dog, because Craig knew that they could not be objective about it. (B) Firstly, both Joseph and Craig are emotionally attached to their dog, which is a shared responsibility in their relationship. Thus, seeking advice from someone who is involved in the same situation might seem counterintuitive. However, there are several reasons why Joseph would choose to ask Craig for his opinion on the matter. Step 1: Assess the situation Joseph understands that neither he nor Craig can be objective about what to do with their dog. This is because they both care deeply for their pet and may not want to make a decision that might negatively impact the animal. It is crucial to acknowledge this bias upfront, to ensure they arrive at the best possible decision. Step 2: Recognize Craig's expertise Despite their shared emotional involvement, it is possible that Craig has more experience or knowledge about dogs than Joseph. So, by asking Craig for his input, Joseph is tapping into Craig's expertise in determining the best course of action for their dog. Step 3: Craig's familiarity with the dog Craig likely understands the specific needs and preferences of their dog, as he has spent a considerable amount of time with the pet. By asking him for advice, Joseph is acknowledging that Craig's familiarity with the dog's behaviors and needs can shed light on what should be done. Step 4: Facilitate communication By engaging Craig in a conversation about their dog, Joseph creates an opportunity for both of them to share their thoughts and concerns. This communication can help them identify potential solutions that might address the dog-related issue they are facing. Step 5: Arriving at a consensus Joseph and Craig need to develop a plan that both of them agree on, since it will affect them equally. By starting the conversation and asking for Craig's input, Joseph is initiating the process of joint decision-making, which can lead to a better outcome for both of them and their pet. Ultimately, Joseph is right to ask Craig for his views on what to do with their dog, even though they both might not be completely objective due to their emotional attachment. This step is essential to foster open dialogue and utilize each other's unique knowledge and experiences, which ultimately helps them make a well-informed decision for their beloved pet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That ignominious possibility was averted when Broad leathered the first delivery with the second new ball to the extra-cover boundary on his way to 47, made at more than a run a ball, and when he was lbw to Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who then bowled Liam Plunkett for a fourth wicket, England were at least able to edge their way towards something more respectable during the last hour with an unbroken last wicket stand of 54 from Jimmy Anderson and Root. England will resume on the fourth morning on 352 for nine, a deficit on first innings of 106. The postprandial period is the only thing that has brought this match to life. On the first day, two wickets immediately after the lunch interval set India back when it seemed as if Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara were indestructible. A day later, and England’s best bowling spell of the match saw four wickets fall for two runs in the first hour, before things calmed down again to the extent that Kumar and Mohammed Shami were able to compile the century last-wicket partnership that has taken on even more importance than it did even at the time. And now this. Perhaps the Trent has gone tidal and the high water mark is reached mid-afternoon. The three main Indian seamers, Sami, Kumar and Ishant Sharma, bowled beautifully, the last one in particular, while conceding runs at a rate, making the key inroads with the wickets of Robson and Ballance and the added one of Ian Bell, making batting look ridiculously easy for almost an hour before the softest of dismissals, in an urgent spell from the Pavilion End. Later Kumar, medium fast at best, wobbled the old ball and the new one sufficiently to produce a spell of four for 16 that took the England innings to the brink of destruction. Although the pitch did not change character noticeably, with the ball still generally slouching through to the keeper, and the slips posted by Dhoni rarely looking as if they might come into play, it may be that the atmospheric conditions were more conducive to the sort of movement more usually associated with the ground. It was warm and the blustery wind of the first day had dropped to little more than a gentle flag-flapping murmur. There was cloud cover too, thin but a veil nonetheless and sometimes that is all a bowler needs. Importantly, Dhoni managed to get the ball changed in the middle of the 55th over, with the score 150 for two and Ballance, minus Robson who was lbw to Sharma before lunch, but now with Bell, batting with confidence. Dhoni’s complaint that the ball had lost its shape was upheld when Kumar Dharmasena, the Sri Lankan umpire, was unable to pass it through the measuring rings that they keep for just this testing purpose. England could have no complaint on those grounds. However, replacement balls, supposed to be in a similar state of wear, are almost invariably not only in better surface condition but harder too. Sharma, in his first over with this second ball, found movement to have the left-hander Ballance lbw for 71, with the further wickets of Bell, Moeen Ali, Matt Prior (astounded to be given out caught at the wicket from a delivery he demonstrably did not touch) and Ben Stokes, for a second-ball duck that may have endangered the dressing room lockers, following inside the next 15 overs, as the ball swung, in orthodox fashion or otherwise. Whether there really is a flicker of life in the pitch itself, or if it has been strictly a function of how the Indian bowlers have performed, remains to be seen when England have their turn once more. Late in the day, as Root and Anderson were holding up India in the same frustrating fashion as Kumar and Shami did England, Sharma produced a nasty bouncer to Anderson that rose sharply, and, significantly, lost little pace on its way towards his throat, probably the nastiest ball of the match, that the batsman did well to play. It meant that if encouragement they needed, England will be mindful that even in their current situation, they are not yet out of winning the game, should the seamers find the same level ofmovement. From the India perspective, they will want to make more rapid progress than they did in the first innings where they did not get above 2.8 runs per over, and would like perhaps half an hour’s bowling at England, and Alastair Cook in particular, at the end of the fourth day.

The Kindle Fire's big security problem DETROIT – Security concerns are giving some consumers another reason to hold off on the Kindle Fire, one of the holiday's hottest gadgets. The Fire, launched with heaps of hype as a possible competitor to the Apple iPad, is a more inexpensive option for buyers looking for a tablet-like experience in an e-reader. But concerns grew this week over the device's security. In order to use the Fire, users must tie it to an Amazon.com account — with credit card on file — that is set up to purchase items with just one click. This means that anyone given access to the device can buy, with just a tap, e-books, apps, TV shows and music. Even more concerning: If a user has recently logged into the Amazon.com shopping app, the next person who picks up the Fire can use that app to buy anything from the Web giant's catalog, even if the device has briefly gone dormant between uses. Any items purchased will ship to an address on file with the account. If the second user tries to ship to a new address, the user does lose access to the account holder's credit card. Amazon said a software fix would come for the device in less than two weeks to address some of the security concerns. \\"As with all of our products, we continue to make them better for customers with regular software updates,\\" said Kinley Pearsall, an Amazon spokeswoman. A new class of device Easy one-click purchasing has always been standard with the e-ink members of the Kindle family, but the security concerns didn't become such a hot issue until the release of the Fire. E-ink devices, by their limited nature, are more personal devices. It's also a more cumbersome process to use the device to purchase a book, as it slowly loads each page required in the process. But the Kindle Fire is a device that many are hoping to share with family members. Some are also hoping to gift the Fire to teenagers — a sort of starter tablet. Giving a teen one-click access to a credit card is not exactly ideal. Also concerning to some, the Fire's homescreen includes a carousel of all of a user's most-recently touched content. When a user opens a book, it will revert to the front of the carousel. When a user then browses to a website, a screen grab of that website heads to the front of the carousel. That carousel is not editable by the user, so there's no way to hide any of your recent activity from other users. Amazon confirmed Wednesday to the Detroit Free Press that the pending software update would provide a fix to be able to decide which items appear to be recently used. It will also improve overall performance, Pearsall said. The Fire's Web browsing history is able to be deleted and a passcode can be set on the device to prevent others from using it. Amazon's chief competitor here, the Nook Tablet (250) from Barnes and Noble, does include some security settings. The Nook Tablet allows users to change the settings to require a password to be typed in for each purchase made on the device. Barnes and Noble's tablet also allows users to keep recently read items from being displayed as such and can keep a separate area on the device for just apps for kids. \\"We like the idea of families being able to share devices,\\" said Wendy Bronfin, Barnes and Noble's senior director of children's digital products. There have been complaints about the Fire's hardware, too — most notably the lack of volume buttons, Bluetooth support and a touchscreen that often lags. Amazon is still expected to sell millions of these devices this year, several analysts have predicted. For many, the pains of being an early adopter will be worth it. For others, it might be a good time to sit on the sidelines for a bit. Contact Mark W. Smith at msmith@freepress.com.

Passage:Fletcher was born at Auckland, New Zealand the son of the Rev Joseph Horner Fletcher, a Methodist clergyman, and his wife Kate, née Green. The family arrived in Australia early in 1861, and, after a term of four years in Queensland (where Joseph James studied at Ipswich Grammar School), Rev. Fletcher went to Sydney to become principal of Newington College, from 1865 to 1887. J. J. Fletcher completed his schooling at Newington (1865–1867) and then went to the University of Sydney and graduating BA in 1870 and MA in 1876. In between these years he was a master at Wesley College, Melbourne, under Professor M. H. Irving. As no science degree was offered in Australia, in 1876 resigned from Wesley and went to London, initially studying at the Royal School of Mines and University College, University of London where he studied biology and took his BSc degree there in 1879.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...

In 1932, after six year's teaching at the Royal College, Moore took up a post as the Head of the Department of Sculpture at the Chelsea School of Art. Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The Seven and Five Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. Moore flirted with Surrealism, joining Paul Nash's modern art movement \\"Unit One\\", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the cave of Altamira (which he described as the \\"Royal Academy of Cave Painting\\"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings. In 1938, Moore met Kenneth Clark for the first time. From this time, Clark became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work, and through his position as member of the Arts Council of Great Britain he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist.

A:","completion":"From the context provided, it seems like Robin's main concern is their struggle to make friends at school. They want to find a way to connect with people and build meaningful relationships in their life. Given the answer options provided, let's analyze them one by one to determine which option would be most suitable for addressing Robin's issue. 1) Find friends to connect with: This option aligns closely with Robin's main concern of making friends at school. By actively seeking out new friendships and making a conscious effort to connect with others, Robin can improve their social experiences, reduce their sense of isolation, and enhance their overall well-being. This could involve joining clubs or extracurricular activities at school or participating in local community events where they have the opportunity to meet people with similar interests. 2) Play video games: While playing video games can provide entertainment and potential connections with others through online gaming platforms, it may not directly address Robin's core issue of struggling to make friends at school. Video games can be a fun and engaging way to spend time, but they do not necessarily help Robin develop the social skills needed to foster in-person connections, which seem to be the main focus of their problem. 3) Go to a church: Getting involved in a local church community can potentially provide Robin with opportunities to meet new people and form friendships. However, it's essential to consider whether Robin is religious or open to participating in religious activities if they are not already a part of a spiritual community. Attending church and participating in related activities would only be a viable option if Robin feels comfortable and genuinely interested in being part of such a community. Taking these points into consideration, the most suitable option for Robin seems to be the first one: to find friends to connect with. By actively seeking out and engaging in various social activities, Robin can expand their social circle, improve their social skills, and cultivate connections that will help them overcome their problems making friends at school. While the other options might have some potential benefits, they do not directly address Robin's main concern as effectively as the first option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Ōnin War, and the shōgun's complacent attitude towards it, \\"sanctioned\\" private wars and skirmishes between the other daimyōs. No part of Japan escaped the violence. Although the battles in Kyoto had been abandoned, the war had spread to the rest of Japan. In Yamashiro Province, the Hatakeyama clan had split into two parts that fought each other to a standstill. This stalemate was to have serious consequences. In 1485, the peasantry and jizamurai had had enough, and revolted. Setting up their own army , they forced the clan armies to leave the province. The Ikki became a powerful force, much more than simply an armed mob. By 1486 they had even set up a provisional government for Yamashiro province.:236-237 The Ikki would form and appear throughout other parts of Japan, such as Kaga Province, where a sect of the Jōdo Shinshū Buddhists, the Ikkō, started their own revolt during the Ōnin War after being enlisted by one of Kaga's most prominent warlords, Togashi Masachika. The Ikkō, who had a complex relationship with the Jōdo Shinshō leader Rennyo, appealed to the common peasants in their region, and inevitably formed the Ikkō-ikki. By 1488 the Ikkō-ikki of Kaga Province overthrew Masachika and took control of the province. After this they began building a fortified castle-cathedral along the Yodo River and used it as their headquarters. The Ikkō-ikki and the Yamashiro-ikki part of the general outbreak of civil war. Sansom states some refer to this as gekokujō , or a \\"disturbed social order\\". Sansom further states, \\"The frequent risings of the fifteenth century were expressions of popular discontent in which peasants took part\\".:235 How many parts of Japan escaped the violence?","completion":"The Ōnin War (1467-1477) was a major conflict in Japan that led to a widespread outbreak of violence and marked the beginning of the Sengoku period. Due to the shōgun's complacent attitude towards the war, private wars and skirmishes were practically \\"sanctioned\\" between various daimyōs (feudal lords). As a result, no part of Japan escaped the violence that ensued. One of the significant consequences of the Ōnin War was the rise of the Ikki, armed peasant uprisings that eventually formed into powerful forces and provisional governments throughout Japan. These revolts were a response to the relentless battles and chaos that engulfed the country. In Yamashiro Province, for example, the Hatakeyama clan's internal strife led to the formation of the Yamashiro-ikki. Local peasantry and jizamurai (lesser rural samurais) were united by their discontent with the ongoing war, which eventually compelled them to force the clan army out of the province. Another notable incident was the Ikkō-ikki, an uprising led by a sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhists in Kaga Province during the Ōnin War. Initially enlisted by Togashi Masachika, a prominent warlord, the Ikkō sect's message resonated with the common peasants, ultimately resulting in the formation of the Ikkō-ikki. By 1488, they overthrew Masachika and took control of Kaga Province. Some historians refer to this as gekokujō, meaning \\"the lower overthrows the higher\\" or \\"disturbed social order.\\" These frequent uprisings during the 15th century can be viewed as expressions of popular discontent among peasants. Thus, it is clear that no part of Japan was immune to the violence that stemmed from the Ōnin War, as conflict and turmoil spread throughout the country. The consequences of this widespread unrest would pave the way for the Sengoku period, a time of political chaos and near-constant military conflict that lasted roughly a century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article delves into the extraordinary world of Sydney's \\"Sculptures by the Sea\\" and explores the artistic treasures that lie submerged in the ocean beneath it. History and Overview Launched in 1997, \\"Sculptures by the Sea\\" has since become a highly anticipated affair for both tourists and locals. The annual exhibition spans two kilometers along the iconic shoreline, from Bondi Beach to Tamarama Beach, and boasts a selection of around 100 artworks by local and international artists. However, the exhibition is not just limited to sculptures lining the picturesque coast. In recent years, marine installations have emerged as an integral aspect of the event, with underwater sculptures adorning the seabeds and enriching marine life by providing new habitats for myriad species. Underwater Art The intriguing concept of marine art installations aims to achieve more than merely pushing the boundaries of fine art. Underwater sculptures often serve a dual purpose: they create an immersive experience for divers and introduce innovative approaches to marine conservation. Through the use of eco-friendly materials, these submerged sculptures have the potential to generate artificial reefs that promote marine biodiversity, provide shelter for fish populations, and help to regenerate threatened ecosystems. Additionally, their mesmerizing allure encourages tourism and underscores the importance of valuing and preserving our aquatic environment. Highlight Sculptures \\"Sculptures by the Sea\\" has seen the installation of several remarkable underwater artworks. Some of these submerged masterpieces include: 1. Ocean Ecosystem Installation by Matthew Harding: Crafted from stainless steel, this piece comprises a series of diverse marine species aiming to simulate the wonders of the ocean's ecosystems. It is a testimony to the interconnectedness of all living organisms and sends a strong message about conservation and humanity’s responsibility to protect the environment. 2. Vasili by B.W. Kent: This underwater artwork explores the concept of spiritual energy that transcends the physical realm. It features an ethereal figure covered in a rocky texture that merges with the ocean floor, and bursts into a crescendo of marine life on the surface, symbolizing life's cyclical nature. 3. Poseidon's Children by Jason deCaires Taylor: A cluster of submerged human sculptures, transformed over time as they become one with the ocean floor, serves as a prime example of harmonious interactions between art and marine life. Taylor's work draws attention to the profound beauty and wonder of the underwater world, challenging the perception of traditional art-making. Preservation and Environmental Impact Underwater sculptures in Sydney's \\"Sculptures by the Sea\\" embrace environmentally responsible approaches and materials. The artworks usually undergo a meticulous selection process to ensure they pose no harm to marine life. Made from coral-friendly materials like steel, limestone, or ceramic, these structures serve as crucial platforms for coral growth, creating habitats for a wide range of marine species. In addition, submerged sculptures can help shift the focus away from natural habitats, relieving pressures on vulnerable coral reefs that are frequently visited by divers and snorkelers. Conclusion Sydney's \\"Sculptures by the Sea\\" represents a harmonious blend of art, nature, and the preservation of our planet's most precious resources. As viewers venture beneath the water's surface, they experience a world of submerged artistic treasures that encapsulate the beauty and fragility of the ocean while promoting conservation and awareness. Through the exploration of underwater sculptures, we not only witness the breathtaking scope of human creativity but also deepen our understanding and appreciation of the delicate balance between life, art, and the environment."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Nick is divorced from his wife, who has custody of their two children. Nick also has financial difficulties due to alimony and child support as well as other concerns.Nick reports to a criminal investigation hearing being run by two officers from Internal Affairs, a conference that doesn't go well for him. They ask Nick about his involvement with several officers under investigation. When Nick refuses to squeal on his comrades, Internal Affairs threatens him, suggesting he's as corrupt as the others in the department.While having a drink at a local Italian restaurant/bar, Nick and his partner Charlie Vincent (Andy Garcia) observe two Japanese men having what appears to be a friendly lunch with some Italian gangsters. Nick is increasingly suspicious of the group until another Japanese man enters the restaurant with several armed henchmen and seizes a small package at gunpoint from the leader of the Japanese. As the man turns to leave, one of the Japanese men at the table says, in Japanese, \\"The Oyabun [Godfather] will not stand for this.\\" The leader of the Japanese group chimes in, \\"As always, such a troublesome child.\\" The Japanese man finds these remarks insulting and he slashes the man's throat, stabs another in the chest, and then walks out. Nick and Charlie follow immediately and, after a short chase, arrest the suspect after he nearly kills Nick in a nearby slaughterhouse.The suspect turns out to be a Yakuza gangster by the name of Sato (Yusaku Matsuda).

Aruba (Dutch Caribbean) to Punto Fijo (Venezuela) In January 2018, Venezuela implemented a three-month commercial blockade on the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba, Curaçao and Bonaire, with the Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro alleging that its neighbors were plundering his country's resources and selling them on the black market. While connections between Venezuela and Aruba remain restricted, relations have eased enough for a new flight route to have opened May 18 between Queen Beatrix International Airport in Aruba, and Venezuela's Las Piedras Josefa Camejo International Airport. There are 51 miles between the two airports, but the flight time is just eight minutes.

An Austrian airline has begun what it claims is the world's shortest regular international connection - an eight-minute hop across Lake Constance. The flight offered by People's Viennaline connects St. Gallen-Altenrhein in Switzerland with Friedrichshafen in southern Germany. It's part of a route that continues onward to Cologne, but passengers can book only the short part for 40 euros (A57.53). See Also Europe travel guide An Embraer 145 short-haul jet will connect the Friedrichshafen airport with the Swiss airport Altenrhein. The flight time for the around 20-kilometre-long route between the two regional airport is around eight minutes. German news agency DPA reported that environmentalists aren't thrilled by the new route, which began service on Wednesday. Swiss Green Party politician Meinrad Gschwend says he wants the flights banned. The airline says driving around the lake for an hour would produce as much emissions as the short flight. On Tuesday, Emirates announced it will operate the shortest A380 route in the world flying from Doha to Dubai from December this year. With a flight distance of only 379km, a one way flight will last for less than an hour and the plane could make almost 20 return flights without refuelling.

What's it like to fly when you are within sight of your final destination? Shortest international commercial flight St.Gallen-Altenrhein (Switzerland) to Friedrichshafen (Germany) Lake Constance lies on the Rhine at the northern foot of the Alps and its 571 square kilometers of waters are shared by three countries: Germany, Austria and Switzerland. There are just 20 kilometers, as the crow flies, between St. Gallen-Altenrhein airport, on the northeastern tip of Switzerland and Friedrichshafen, Germany, on the opposite lakeshore. People's Viennaline, a small Austrian airline, will connect the two cities with its new regular service. The journey time? Just eight minutes. This flight, served by Embraer regional jets, is actually just the first leg of a longer route that ends in Cologne. Only about 10% of the forecast annual 40,000 passengers are expected to just take the shorter leg between Altenrhein and Friedrichshafen, says Danel Steffen, CEO of People's Viennaline. \\"But this stopover will benefit both tourists and commuters working on both sides of the lake and, of course, it is also likely to become a must in every aviation enthusiast's logbook,\\" he adds. People's Viennaline: Bringing national stereotypes closer together. As an extra bonus for aviation fans, Friedrichshafen is also where the first Zeppelin airships were built and tested. People's Viennaline is also unusual -- it's the only airline in Europe to be owned by an airport: St.Gallen-Altenrhein. And while the airport is located just meters from the Austrian border, it lies entirely on Swiss territory. \\"The international character of this operation is quite unique,\\" explains Steffen. \\"Although they belong to the same owner, the airport is operating under Swiss laws and regulations and the airline under Austrian ones.\\" It's not the first time an Austrian airline has come close to breaking the record for shortest international flight. Although the idea never came to fruition, in 2015 FlyNiki was reported to be considering launching regular flights between its Vienna hub and nearby Bratislava, 50 kilometers away in Slovakia, or a 10-minute flight.

Please answer the following question: Answer the question below: If a farmer learned worse farming techniques, they could expect to produce more or less food? Assuming that: Better farming techniques and machines increased the food supply and the distribution of food. Answer:","completion":"If a farmer learned worse farming techniques, they could expect to produce less food. The reasoning behind this assumption lies within the basics of farming techniques themselves. Effective farming techniques are methods intended to maximize the productivity of a farm, allowing the farmer to produce the most food possible from the land and resources available. This could include strategic planting practices, efficient watering methods, smart use of fertilizers or pesticides, ideal crop species selection for the environment, or the use of more productive machinery or technology, among many other factors. On the other hand, worse farming techniques would essentially be less effective methods of farming. They might involve poor resource management, impractical planting strategies, ineffective use of fertilizers or pesticides, or inefficient machinery or technology, once again among many other potential factors. If better farming techniques and machinery improve the food supply and its distribution, as per your assumption, then logically worse farming techniques would lead to a decrease in food supply and potentially hamper its distribution. The farmer's production would decrease due to inefficient use of resources and time, thereby leading to less food being produced. Therefore, in the case that a farmer adopted worse farming techniques, there would likely be a direct impact on the farmer's output, i.e., the amount of food that they are able to produce would be expected to go down. Additionally, there could also potentially be negative secondary effects on distribution due to a lower overall food supply available."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Allowing Yourself to Feel without Restrictions This journey begins with a single, uncomplicated yet challenging step: allowing yourself to feel without restrictions. As humans, we tend to guard our emotions for fear of appearing vulnerable or weak. This can lead to suppressed emotions, which, over time, can cause both physical and mental health issues. It's necessary to understand that emotions aren't signs of weakness. They are an inherent part of being human, indicating our capacity to experience life in its full spectrum. Step 2: Practicing Self-Care Once you have learned to embrace your emotions without restrictions, the next important step is to practice self-care. Taking care of your physical, mental, and emotional health is not a luxury but a necessity in today's fast-paced world. Self-care can take many forms—from a simple routine such as getting enough sleep and maintaining a balanced diet, to more complex ones like going for therapy or taking mental health days off work. Nourishing your soul by doing things you love is also an essential aspect of self-care. Step 3: Letting Yourself Laugh Laughter is the best medicine, so they say, and rightfully so. Laughing not only lifts your mood but also reduces stress, strengthens your immune system, and even burns calories. Studies also show that laughter promotes overall well-being and can even prolong your lifespan. Hence, letting yourself laugh, truly and freely, can be a therapeutic aspect of your journey to emotional freedom. Step 4: Expressing Your Feelings Creatively Creative expression makes for a healthy outlet for your unbridled feelings. Be it painting, writing, dancing, or music, expressing your feelings creatively can help you understand and process your emotions better. The act of creation also helps to release pent-up emotions and is a meaningful way of self-expression that further encourages healing. Step 5: Regaining Your Confidence As you undergo this process of authentic self-exploration, you naturally begin to regain your lost confidence. Embracing your feelings, practicing self-care, laughing, and expressing yourself creatively will breed a newfound appreciation for yourself. This appreciation gradually transforms into self-confidence. You will learn to value your worth and understand that your feelings, thoughts, and expressions are valid and significant. In conclusion, embracing your emotions without restrictions, practicing self-care, promoting laughter, expressing feelings creatively, and regaining confidence form a pathway for you to reclaim your emotional freedom. Remember, each step is as vital as its predecessor and contributes to an overall state of well-being. So, take this journey at your own pace and remember—it's okay to feel, it's okay to take care of yourself, and it's perfectly okay to be you."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: The toll badge will cost up to €130 (£103; 162) a year, depending on a car's age, engine size and emissions. German motorists will pay tolls for local roads as well as the Autobahn motorways. But that will be offset by a cut in their motor vehicle tax. The European Commission has warned that the new toll may be discriminatory. A letter from EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc, quoted by German media, says the offset scheme for German drivers - to spare them additional road costs - may discriminate against foreigners, thereby violating EU law. The toll - known in German as \\"Pkw-Maut\\" - is not yet law. The plan is to introduce it in 2016. The Social Democrats (SPD), in a coalition led by the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), cautioned that important details would still have to be hammered out in parliament. \\"The Pkw-Maut won't leave the Bundestag [lower house] in the form in which it arrived,\\" said Soren Bartol, a senior SPD politician. The plan presented by Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt gives foreign drivers the option of buying a 10-day toll badge for €10 or a two-month one for €20. Camper vans will be taxed, along with cars. But motorbikes, electric cars, adapted cars for the disabled and ambulances will all be exempt. Mr Dobrindt, of the CSU, said the new toll could generate €500m annually to spend on road infrastructure.

Lila Loomis (Vera Miles), sister of Marion Crane, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the seven people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home behind the Bates Motel by Dr. Bill Raymond (Robert Loggia), who assures him everything will be fine. Norman is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey (Dennis Franz). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job as a dishwasher and busboy at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar). One of his co-workers there is Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly), a young waitress. After work, Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay.

The White House declined to comment, the Post notes.","completion":"Title: Secret Service Considers New Security Measures Following White House Breach Introduction: The Secret Service is contemplating various security upgrades at the White House after Omar Gonzalez successfully leaped a fence and entered the residence. Following this alarming event, the agency aims to improve safety protocols at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Increased Surveillance and Security Officers: In response to the incident, the director of the Secret Service has immediately increased surveillance and the number of officers patrolling the White House grounds. As per a law enforcement official, the Secret Service is actively conducting \\"preliminary discussions\\" to implement more extensive security measures. Expanding the White House Security Perimeter: One proposal under consideration involves the enlargement of the White House security perimeter. This would entail establishing checkpoints for visitor screenings at least a block away from the White House gates, as well as prohibiting pedestrian access to the sidewalks surrounding the White House fence. According to the Washington Post, these measures aim to strengthen existing security protocols. Challenges: Coordination and Accessibility: Despite the Secret Service's plans to enhance security, officials face two significant hurdles - coordinating the new procedures with multiple agencies, such as the Secret Service itself, DC's Metropolitan Police Department, and the US Park Police; and preserving access to one of Washington DC's most visited tourist sites. The New York Times highlights these issues as essential considerations in finalizing any new security measures.

Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Are Billardiera and Calothamnus both types of genuses? Answer:","completion":"Billardiera and Calothamnus are indeed two distinct types of genuses, each belonging to separate plant families and exhibiting unique characteristics. To fully comprehend the similarities and differences between the two genuses, as well as their respective taxonomic classifications, it is necessary to examine their individual traits, classification, and the significance of their role in the plant kingdom. Billardiera is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pittosporaceae, native to Australia. Named after the French botanist Jacques Labillardière, it comprises around 54 species. The plants under this classification are usually either climbing or trailing shrubs found mainly in eucalypt forests, woodlands, and heathlands. Their flowers can be tubular or bell-shaped, with colors ranging from green to purple or blue. Some of the popular species in the Billardiera genus include Billardiera longiflora (better known as Purple Apple Berry), Billardiera scandens (commonly called Apple Berry), and Billardiera cymosa (referred to as Sweet Apple Berry). These plants are known for their edible fruits and have been utilized by Indigenous Australians for food, as well as for medicinal and cultural purposes. Calothamnus, on the other hand, is a genus of shrubs in the family Myrtaceae, which is also native to Australia. It comprises approximately 40 species that are primarily found in heathlands and sandy regions of Western Australia. Calothamnus plants are characterized by their needle-like leaves and striking red or orange flowers. The genus is closely related to the genus Melaleuca, and some botanists have suggested merging the two due to their similarities. The unique and showy flowers of Calothamnus species make them a popular choice for ornamental purposes in gardens, particularly in Australia. Moreover, their dense growth habit and evergreen foliage make them attractive habitat plants, providing shelter and food for various bird species, such as honeyeaters. In conclusion, Billardiera and Calothamnus are both types of genuses, each possessing its own set of unique characteristics and belonging to separate plant families. While Billardiera is classified under the family Pittosporaceae and mainly features climbing or trailing shrubs with bell-shaped flowers, Calothamnus belongs to the family Myrtaceae and includes shrubs with needle-like leaves and striking red or orange flowers. Each genus contributes to the biodiversity of the Australian flora, with both ornamental and ecological value. Furthermore, they highlight the remarkable adaptability of plants to the diverse environment that Australia offers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have an equation: 237*d = 41*d - 1165 - 599 Think of \\"d\\" as the number of candies in one bag. We have two situations: 1. 237 bags with \\"d\\" candies in each, (237 * d) candies in total. 2. 41 bags with \\"d\\" candies in each, minus 1165 candies and minus 599 candies (41 * d - 1165 - 599). These two situations have the same amount of candies, so we can find how many candies \\"d\\" are in each bag. Lets first combine the numbers in situation 2. Step 1: Combine numbers 41*d - 1165 - 599 = 41*d - 1764 Now our equation looks like: 237 * d = 41 * d - 1764 Step 2: Move the 41*d from the right side of the equation to the left side to simplify 237 * d - 41 * d = -1764 Step 3: Combine the 'd' terms 196 * d = -1764 Step 4: Divide both sides by 196 to find 'd' d = -1764 / 196 Step 5: Calculate the division d = -9 So number of candies (d) in each bag is -9.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose father was determined that his sons would not work in the mines? is inside the article: Henry Moore was born in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale colliery in Castleford. He was an autodidact with an interest in music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.On his second attempt he was accepted at Castleford Grammar School, which several of his siblings had attended, where his headmaster soon noticed his talent and interest in medieval sculpture. His art teacher broadened his knowledge of art, and with her encouragement, he determined to make art his career; first by sitting for examinations for a scholarship to the local art college. Moore's earliest recorded carvings – a plaque for the Scott Society at Castleford Secondary School, and a Roll of Honour commemorating the boys who went to fight in the First World War from the school – were executed around this time.Despite his early promise, Moore's parents had been against him training as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became a teacher at the school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a physical training instructor, only returning to France as the Armistice was signed.

Question: Process: - Blood carried into kidney by the renal artery - Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood - The waste that is filtered out mixes with water - Become urine - Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose drinking sufficient amounts of water happens, how will it affect the urine is healthy. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Drinking sufficient amounts of water is essential for maintaining proper kidney function and overall health. When adequate water intake occurs, it directly affects the process of urine formation and kidney function. To address the perturbation hypothesis, let us delve deeper into the process of urine formation and how sufficient water intake affects it. The mentioned process involves: 1. Blood carried into the kidney by the renal artery: Blood from the body reaches the kidneys through the renal arteries. The renal artery branches into smaller arterioles, which further divide into a network of capillaries called the glomerulus. 2. Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood: Nephrons are the functional units of the kidney, and each kidney contains around 1 million nephrons. Each nephron comprises a glomerulus and a renal tubule. The filtration of blood occurs in the glomerulus, which is a network of capillaries located within the Bowman's capsule. The blood pressure forces water, salts, glucose, and other small molecules through the glomerular capillary walls and into the Bowman's capsule. This fluid is called the filtrate. 3. The waste that is filtered out mixes with water: After the filtrate enters the renal tubule, selective reabsorption and secretion occur. Useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. Excess substances and waste products are secreted into the tubular fluid. The tubular fluid then combines with water to form urine. 4. Become urine: The concentrated mixture of waste products and water in the renal tubules is now referred to as urine. The amount of water present in the urine depends on the body's hydration levels, which influence the kidneys' ability to concentrate or dilute the urine. 5. Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys: Urine formed in the nephrons collects in the renal pelvis, which connects to the ureters. These are muscular tubes that transport the urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder, where it gets stored until elimination. When an individual drinks sufficient amounts of water, it impacts several aspects of the urinary process: A. Dilutes urine: Proper hydration ensures that the urine is appropriately diluted, preventing a higher concentration of waste products and minerals that can lead to kidney stone formation and other kidney-related problems. B. Adequate urine output: Sufficient water intake ensures that kidneys produce an adequate amount of urine, which helps in flushing out waste products and toxins from the body effectively. C. Proper kidney function: When the body is well-hydrated, it eases the filtration process in the glomerulus. Consequently, it reduces the workload on the kidneys and helps maintain their overall health. D. Infection prevention: Adequate urine production helps flush out bacteria from the urinary system, decreasing the likelihood of infections in the urinary tract. In conclusion, drinking sufficient amounts of water has a direct and positive impact on the urine formation process and kidney health. It leads to adequately diluted urine, proper urine output, decreased risk of kidney stones and infections, and helps maintain overall kidney function. Considering the perturbation hypothesis, it is evident that the proposed scenario contributes to a healthier urinary system and optimal kidney function."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Two of Earth's oceans provide vast quantities of fish for human consumption. The Indian ocean hosts a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer. The Pacific ocean has less phytoplankton and nutrients for marine life. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which ocean experiences a stronger coastal upwelling? Hint: Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer, due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries. Over several millennia, however, the global system of garbage patches will accumulate in the North Pacific.In 2016 six new animal...

(c). growing at a rate of 6.6 percent each day. (d). producing 46% of the world's supply of fish. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A new United Nations report shows that fish farming may soon be the world's most important provider of fish. The Food and Agriculture Organization says fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year. Fish farming now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish. That represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006. The report also said fish farming earned more money in 2008 than traditional fisheries. In fish farming, fish are raised in tanks or small bodies of water called ponds. They are also raised in cages or nets in oceans, lakes and rivers. The report says increased fish farming has helped people around the world eat record amounts of fish. The FAO says each person ate an average of almost seventeen kilograms of fish last year. However, the FAO says the current yearly wild-fish harvest of ninety million tons shows no improvement. Decreasing numbers of fish and stronger catch limits have reduced the possibilities for catching wild fish. The FAO report says about thirty-two percent of world supplies are overfished. It says these supplies of fish need to be rebuilt at once. Some scientists have criticized fish farming. They say the nets and cages permit fish diseases and pests to spread. Some fish farming critics doubt whether fish farming can keep growing at the current rate. But Wally Stevens of the trade group Global Aquaculture Alliance says the industry must continue developing to feed growing populations. Mr. Stevens says a one hundred percent increase in fish farming over ten years is necessary to keep providing for people at the current level. He notes that fish farming creates jobs and wealth, especially for people in coastal areas of China. Question: We learn that since the year 2006, fish farming has been _ .

You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: Bubba and Dean are two farmers which realized the benefits of having AM fungi in their soil. Dean, however, took active steps in helping the growth of AM fungi so he grew cover crops on his lands. and a hint : Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. Please answer this question : Which farmer didn't increase the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop?","completion":"Based on the given information, it is clear that Bubba is the farmer who did not actively take steps to help the growth of AM fungi and therefore did not increase the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop. Dean, on the other hand, recognized the importance of having AM fungi in the soil and took proactive measures to enhance their growth. He grew cover crops on his lands, which helped extend the time for AM fungi's development into the autumn, winter, and spring. This promotion of hyphal growth led to a more extensive extraradical hyphal network that could colonize the roots of the new crop and ultimately benefited from the symbiotic relationship between the fungi and the plants. Consequently, the early establishment of this relationship allowed plants to access a well-established hyphal network and receive adequate phosphorus nutrition during the early growth stages, resulting in improved crop yield. In summary, Dean, who implemented cover crop systems, effectively increased the extraradical hyphal network that could colonize the roots of the new crop, enabling better phosphorus uptake and enhanced crop yield. Bubba, who did not take any such measures, did not increase the extraradical hyphal network."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens.

Passage: In England, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300, and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million. By the end of 1350, the Black Death subsided, but it never really died out in England. Over the next few hundred years, further outbreaks occurred in 1361–1362, 1369, 1379–1383, 1389–1393, and throughout the first half of the 15th century. An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15% of the population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479–1480 could have been as high as 20%. The most general outbreaks in Tudor dynasty and House of Stuart England seem to have begun in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636, and ended with the Great Plague of London in 1665.","completion":"1.

Answer: (350,000 - 200,000) / ((7 million - 4 million) / 2) = 30%. 3. If the population in 1471 was 3 million and the plague took 10-15% of the population, how many people died during this outbreak? Answer: (3 million * 10%) to (3 million * 15%) = 300,000 to 450,000. 4. How many years passed between the earliest outbreak in the Tudor dynasty (1498) and the Great Plague of London (1665)?

Make this lower case","completion":"The European Union (EU) is composed of 27 member countries, all working together to promote a range of policies and objectives on various issues such as economy, environment, and social welfare. Conservation of biodiversity is also a key objective pursued by the EU, which it seeks to accomplish on global, regional, and national levels. The EU's approach to biodiversity conservation involves a multifaceted strategy that includes collaborative efforts, numerous policies, funding initiatives, and outreach programs. Globally, the EU exerts considerable influence on international environmental issues through its role as a major economic and political power. It actively participates in international conventions, contributing significantly to target-setting and policy-making processes. For instance, the EU played a critical role in shaping the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which was adopted in 1992 and currently has 196 parties working together to conserve species and ecosystems. By adhering to global targets established under the CBD and other international agreements, such as the 2011-2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, the EU ensures that its policies are in line with internationally agreed commitments. Moreover, the EU has undertaken several efforts to coordinate with non-EU economies on matters related to biodiversity conservation, such as establishing dialogue forums and offering financial aid in support of developing countries. Regionally, the EU seeks to preserve biodiversity within its own borders through the implementation of various directives and legal frameworks. The Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive are two fundamental legislative tools the EU uses to protect species and habitats. The Natura 2000 network, a vast assembly of protected areas, was established following these directives. This extensive network spans about 18% of the EU's land area and nearly 10% of its marine territory, forming the largest coordinated network of protected areas in the world. To ensure proper enforcement and coordination between member states, the EU has developed a nature conservation policy infrastructure. This involves clear strategies, specific targets, reporting obligations, and regular evaluation of progress. In 2011, the EU Biodiversity Strategy was adopted, providing a comprehensive roadmap to meet the Aichi Biodiversity Targets at the regional level. Furthermore, the EU has initiated multiple funding mechanisms to support biodiversity conservation projects, such as the LIFE program and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Nationally, EU member states implement various policies to conserve biodiversity within their own territories. These policies must align with the overall EU objectives, directives, and regulations. Consequently, the EU plays a crucial role in guiding and coordinating national policies to ensure coherence among member states and effective implementation of measures. Besides legislation, the EU has undertaken significant efforts to raise public awareness and involvement in biodiversity conservation. It promotes the integration of biodiversity considerations into different sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, and forestry through subsidy and reward systems, aiming to reduce detrimental impacts on the environment and foster sustainable practices. In conclusion, the EU is a key player in the conservation of biodiversity at global, regional, and national levels. Through its active participation in international initiatives and agreements, implementation of impactful legislative frameworks, funding programs, and strategies to promote public awareness, the entity contributes significantly to the preservation and restoration of ecosystems and species across the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, further details about almonds' taxonomy are given, with the classification and relationships in their scientific nomenclature. Ajoblanco is a popular traditional Spanish cold soup, primarily made from almonds and often served chilled. It is particularly popular in the regions of Andalusia and Extremadura in Spain and is also known as \\"white gazpacho\\" or \\"garlic soup.\\" This soup is quite unique and refreshing, as it combines the nutty and rich flavor of almonds with various other key ingredients such as garlic, bread, olive oil, and vinegar. Ajoblanco is usually served with garnishes like grapes or melon to contrast the soup's creamy texture and add a touch of fruity freshness. The main ingredient in Ajoblanco, almonds, belongs to the family Rosaceae, which is a diverse plant family in the order Rosids. The Rosaceae family contains a wide variety of plants, including not only almonds, but also other essential crops such as apples, pears, plums, cherries, strawberries, and many ornamental plants like roses. The family Rosaceae is part of the order Rosids, which is one of the most significant groups of eudicots (flowering plants) in terms of overall species diversity and economic importance. The word \\"Rosids\\" comes from Latin \\"rosa,\\" which means \\"rose,\\" and \\"id\\" as a suffix indicates a relationship with the rose family.

Clarke, 33, defying painful back spasms to bat again and only after a night of intense physiotherapy and painkilling injections, joined Steve Smith at the crease when play resumed on day two. He brought up a magnificent century at the Adelaide Oval after a second rain delay. His celebration was subdued at first, kissing the helmet and hugging Smith before allowing himself a small smile.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Pentagon says budget cuts could hurt Afghan war effort, warns of major furloughs ahead The Afghan war effort eventually would be harmed by across-the-board budget cuts, even as the Obama administration intends to shield the military's combat mission from the reductions, the Pentagon's No. 2 official said Friday. \\"There will be second-order effects on the war,\\" Ashton Carter, the deputy defense secretary, said in an interview in his office with a small group of reporters. Deferred maintenance on weapons and other equipment, for example, will eventually erode the combat fitness of military units deploying to Afghanistan, he said. The U.S. has about 66,000 troops in Afghanistan, with an undetermined number of withdrawals expected this year and in 2014. The administration holds out hope that Congress will come up with a deficit-cutting mechanism to replace the across-the-board spending cuts due to take effect March 1, but Carter suggested that hopes are not high. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have repeatedly warned that the threatened defense cuts, amounting to about 50 billion this budget year, would hurt national security. Carter said he feared that the message has not been heard widely enough in Congress and across the country. If the cuts take effect in March, hundreds of thousands of Pentagon civilian employees will face furloughs and reduced paychecks by April, Carter said. They would lose one day of work per week for the remainder of the budget year, which ends in September, he said. \\"This is painful to use,\\" Carter said. The Pentagon has about 800,000 civilian employees; they have not yet been officially notified of furloughs. Carter said the furloughs would be expected to save 5 billion. No military positions will be cut, he said. Carter said the Pentagon already is eliminating all 46,000 of its temporary civilian workers in anticipation of budget cuts.

It means \\"rebirth\\". It's a strange name for a period of history. What was exactly \\" reborn\\" during the Renaissance? To answer this question, we need to look back at the time of the Roman Empire. At this time Roman artists, scientists and writers influenced by Greek ideas were the world's most advanced. They had become skilled observers of the natural world around them, and had become experts in studying animals, plants, the human body or the stars and planets. They wrote down their ideas about what they saw, and based their theories about the world on their observations. During the fourth and fifth centuries the Roman Empire slowly broke down. Many of the Romans' art and sculptures were destroyed and some manuscripts were lost as well. But most importantly, some of the ancient attitudes were lost. A questioning approach to the world was replaced by an unquestioning one. Why did this happen? One reason was to do with the influence of the Christian Church. Through the thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Church controlled many aspects of life including education and learning. The Church ran all the universities and thought that the aim of a university should be to teach old ideas more clearly, not to introduce new ones. The scholars in the universities were expected to study God and heaven from the Bible and ancient books, rather than the world around them. Take medicine for example. The main textbook for doctors had been written by a Greek doctor called Galen more than a thousand years earlier. But when Roger Bacon, a thirteenth-century priest , said that a new approach to medicine was needed --- doctors should do their own original research instead of reading writers from the past such as Galen-the Church put him in prison. By the time of the fourteenth century, however, some parts of the Christian Church were becoming less strict about their ideas and there was a new state of mind among artists, doctors and scientist.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake.

Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him.

How do you do this: To get a dog to take his pills.","completion":"Getting a dog to take his pills can be challenging, as many dogs are quite picky about what they eat and can even detect medication hidden in their food. However, there are various methods that you can use to help administer medication to your dog. Here are several techniques that you can try: 1. Hide the pill in food or a treat: One of the most common methods to give a pill to your dog is to hide it in something the dog readily enjoys eating. Some popular options include: a. Soft food: If your dog eats wet food, you can try hiding the pill inside a blob of wet food. Make sure the pill is completely concealed within the food. b. Peanut butter or cream cheese: These sticky foods can mask the pill entirely and make it difficult for the dog to separate the pill from the food. c. Treats: You can purchase pill pockets, soft treats specifically designed to hide pills inside. Alternatively, you can use other soft treats your dog likes, such as small pieces of cheese or hot dogs. 2. Crush the pill and mix it with food: If the pill can be crushed or opened (check with your veterinarian first), you can mix the contents with your dog's regular food or a small amount of a strong-smelling food, like canned fish or meat baby food. The aroma of the food can help mask the smell and taste of the medicine. 3. Use a pill dispenser: A pill dispenser is a small device that holds the pill while you position it in the dog's mouth. Gently insert the dispenser into your dog's mouth, aiming to place it towards the back of the throat, then release the pill. Close your dog's mouth and hold it shut while gently stroking its throat to encourage swallowing. 4. Manually administer the pill: This method may require some practice and patience, but it can be effective for dogs that cannot be tricked into taking pills otherwise. a. Place your dog on a higher surface like a table or counter, with a non-slip mat or towel, or have someone gently hold your dog still. b. Hold the pill between your index finger and thumb. With your other hand, gently hold your dog's muzzle from above and tilt the head back slightly. c. Use your free fingers to press on the gap between the upper and lower canine teeth, gently opening the mouth. d. Quickly and carefully place the pill as far back in the throat as possible, avoiding the sharp premolar teeth. e. Close your dog's mouth, hold it shut, and gently stroke the throat to encourage swallowing. You can also try blowing on the dog's nose, which may stimulate a swallowing reflex. 5. Use a compounding pharmacy: If your dog is extremely resistant to taking pills or if the medication causes a negative reaction, you can ask your veterinarian about using a compounding pharmacy. These pharmacies can transform the medication into a liquid, flavored chewable treat, or even a topical gel that may be more acceptable to your dog. Remember to always follow your veterinarian's instructions regarding medication administration, and provide positive reinforcement (praise, petting, or treats) after your dog has successfully taken its medication. It's essential to be patient and gentle during this process, as making it a positive experience will make it easier in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Duplication may range from extension of short tandem repeats, to duplication of a cluster of genes, and all the way to duplication of entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. Such duplications are probably fundamental to the creation of genetic novelty. What is a possible product of duplications?","completion":"A possible product of duplications is the creation of genetic novelty, which serves as a driving force behind the evolution and diversification of species. Genetic duplication can lead to several advantageous outcomes, including the emergence of new genes with novel functions, generation of genetic redundancy, and increased gene dosage. This detailed answer will explore these three areas in more depth. 1. Emergence of new genes with novel functions: When a gene is duplicated, the resulting copy is initially functionally redundant – it performs the same task as the original gene. However, over time, mutations could accumulate in the duplicated gene, potentially changing its function. This process is called neofunctionalization. It allows the duplicated gene to take on a new role, either by gaining a new function or modifying an existing one. The emergence of new genes from duplications contributes to the diversification of genetic functions and enhances the complexity of organisms. For example, the development of the four-legged body plan, or tetrapod, in vertebrates is believed to have been facilitated by the duplication of Hox genes, which are critical in body plan determination. The expansion of this gene family allowed for greater specification and differentiation of limb structures, permitting the transition from aquatic to terrestrial lifestyles. 2. Generation of genetic redundancy: Another possible product of duplications is the creation of genetic redundancy. This means that multiple genes can perform the same function in an organism. Genetic redundancy has a buffering effect against deleterious mutations, as the presence of multiple functional copies with similar or identical roles ensures that, even if one gene is lost or damaged, the organism's overall function and survival will not be significantly impacted. Redundancy can also facilitate subfunctionalization – a process by which the functions of the original gene are partitioned between the duplicated genes in complementary or partially overlapping manners. This division of labor can help to fine-tune and optimize specific biological functions within an organism. 3. Increased gene dosage: Gene duplications may also lead to an increased gene dosage effect. It refers to the increase in gene copy number that may result in higher expression levels of the gene product or protein in the organism. An increased gene dosage could be advantageous in certain environmental conditions or during specific developmental stages. For example, a stressor such as heat or toxic chemicals may require higher expression levels of proteins involved in the stress response. The presence of multiple copies of genes encoding these proteins would enable organisms to adapt more effectively to harsh or rapidly changing environments, promoting their survival and evolution. In conclusion, while duplications are inherent in the structure and function of genomes, they offer immense potential for genetic variability and adaptation. Through the emergence of new genes with novel functions, generation of genetic redundancy for backup and fine-tuning, and increased gene dosage for improved stress responses, duplications contribute substantially to the complexity, survival, and evolvability of species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, our storyline should revolve around the idea of discovering the origins of cinema and how 'The Blob' played a crucial role in that. Step 2: Establish main characters For our plot, we will need a set of main characters: 1. A history professor (Dr. James) who is passionate about the origins of cinema 2. His brilliant but rebellious student (Emma) who helps him explore the history 3. A mysterious collector (Mr. Wilson) who possesses rare film artifacts and objects Step 3: Develop the initial conflict and motivation Dr. James is a well-respected history professor who has dedicated his life to uncovering the origins of cinema. He believes that 'The Blob' was the first-ever movie, contrary to popular belief. Emma, an enthusiastic student of his, shares his passion and joins him in trying to prove this theory. Step 4: Create the inciting incident Dr. James and Emma come across a newspaper article, dated back to 1895, which mentions the discovery of a lost film reel that supposedly contains the footage of 'The Blob'. They find out that the reel is now in the possession of the reclusive collector, Mr. Wilson. Motivated by this information, they embark on a quest to find Mr. Wilson and acquire the film reel. Step 5: Introduce the main challenges, hurdles, and obstacles Dr. James and Emma will face numerous challenges in their quest: 1. Convincing the enigmatic Mr. Wilson to show them the film reel and share his knowledge 2. Decoding the secretive language used in notes and letters related to the lost film reel 3. Evading a rival historian who is determined to discredit Dr. James and his theory Step 6: Present the climax In the climax of the movie, Dr. James, Emma, and Mr. Wilson manage to assemble a group of various film artifacts, including the lost film reel, inside a makeshift theater. They meticulously set up an antique film projector and play 'The Blob' for the first time in over a century. As they watch the film unfold, they discover a hidden message encrypted within the reel, proving that 'The Blob' is indeed the first-ever movie, and subsequently, they reveal this exceptional discovery to the world. Step 7: Conclude the movie with a resolution Having achieved their goal, Dr. James' theory is finally acknowledged as a ground-breaking revelation in the world of cinema history. He earns the recognition and respect he deserves. Emma, on the other hand, has grown immensely from this experience and decides to pursue a career in film history. Mr. Wilson, moved by their passion, decides to share his vast collection of film artifacts with the world, opening up a new era of film preservation and appreciation.

The closest thing to the description this film has is about a Texas family of five struggling to relate and exist together when they are all very different people. They deal with death, fear, growing up, and just making it through a day. However, the story itself is woven into other visuals that make it just a part of what director Terrence Malick is trying to say. If you want something basic, stay away from this movie entirely. But if you're stricken by movies that make you say. \\"Wait, huh?\\" then you should rush out to see it immediately with someone and plan to hold a summit afterward discussing what it means. A Method To His Madness? The loose, disjointed style of the story involved both the 1950s version of the O'Brien family as well as the present-day version of their oldest son Young Jack. There are no solid beginning-middle-ends in any scene; they play out more like a merory or a dream does in your head. Therefore, the audience is left with less of a definitive statement about what's going on, and more of an emotional connection to what they see on screen. We drift through scenes, getting a vague idea that Mr O'Brien is overbearing and Mrs O'Brien is very nurturing , and that the children are growing up with a strong sense of how to move around the imbalance between their parents. Now, throw in scenes of Sean Penn wandering around the high-tech modern city, looking like the rug has been pulled out from underneath his soul. Add in a dash of nature shots, including but not limited to magrna, the ocean, dinosaurs, and hillsides... What Does It All Mean? It is very clear that Malick wants us to have a sense of this family as a part of the entire universe. A child frightened at his father's touch is a microcosm of the dark expanse above our heads, and it exists alongside the tides, animals, and even God. It all depends on what you believe, which is why this movie is so interesting.

This will protect your nails and forms a smooth layer for application of the comic strips. After grooming your nails to perfection, the next step is to paint your nails with your usual base coat. The base coat serves to protect your nails from potential damage caused by the nail polish and also forms a smooth layer on which the comic strips can be applied. This ensures that the comic strips adhere smoothly and last longer on your nails. While waiting for the base coat to dry, take some time to select the comic strips you want to use. Choose images or panels that are small enough to fit comfortably on your nails, and trim them to the desired size. You can either cut out individual panels or use a continuous strip if you want to create a storyline across all your nails. Once the base coat is dry, apply a thin layer of clear or colored nail polish that complements the colors within the comic strip. Allow it to dry completely before proceeding with the application of the comic strips. Using tweezers or your fingers, carefully place the trimmed comic strips onto your nails. Press down firmly and smooth out any wrinkles or bubbles that might form. To seal the comic strips onto your nails, apply a clear topcoat over both the comic strip and the entirety of your nails. This step is crucial as it ensures that the comic strip stays in place and does not peel or chip prematurely. The topcoat also adds a layer of shine and protection, making your manicure appear professionally done and enhancing its overall appearance. Allow the topcoat to dry thoroughly, giving ample time for all layers to set properly. Be patient and avoid any activities that could potentially smudge or damage your freshly-painted comic strip nails. Once your nails are completely dry, show off your unique and eye-catching manicure that showcases your love for both fashion and comic strips. Your friends and acquaintances will undoubtedly be impressed with the creativity and skill involved in your comic strip nail art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer?","completion":"While the suggested answer does mention some points about Argentina's territorial claims, it does not provide a comprehensive view of what Argentina is known for. A more detailed answer should cover various aspects of Argentina, including its culture, geography, sports, economy, and history. To give you a better understanding, here is a more detailed answer: Argentina is known for its diverse culture, rich history, and a variety of natural landscapes. The country has a mix of European and indigenous influences, with a strong Italian and Spanish impact on its language, customs, and traditions. Geographically, Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world and the second-largest in South America. It has a wide range of landscapes, which includes the impressive Andes Mountains, the fertile Pampas grasslands, subtropical rainforests, and vast deserts like the Atacama in the northwest. The Iguazu Falls, located in the northeastern part of the country, is one of the most stunning natural wonders that Argentina is famous for. Argentina is well-known for its tango music and dance. Originating in Buenos Aires in the 19th century, the Argentine Tango has since become an iconic symbol of the country's culture and is enjoyed worldwide. Sport is an essential part of Argentine society, with football being the most popular. Argentina has produced some of the world's most renowned footballers, such as Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. The national football team has won two FIFA World Cups, in 1978 and 1986. In terms of the economy, Argentina is known for its agricultural sector, particularly the production of soybeans, beef, and wine. The country is one of the leading producers and exporters of beef worldwide, and its wines, especially from the Mendoza region, have gained international recognition. Historically, Argentina plays a significant role in Latin America. It gained its independence from Spain in 1816 and has since encountered periods of political and economic turmoil, as well as periods of growth and progress. Famous Argentine figures include revolutionary leader and key figure in South American independence, José de San Martín, and Eva Perón, the iconic first lady who championed for labor rights and women's suffrage in the 1940s and '50s. Lastly, as mentioned in the suggested answer, Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica, the Falkland Islands, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. These claims, specifically the Falkland Islands, have been a source of tension between Argentina and the United Kingdom, leading to the Falklands War in 1982. In conclusion, Argentina is known for much more than its territorial claims. To validate the answer, you should consider incorporating the aspects mentioned above to provide a more comprehensive understanding of what Argentina is famous for."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I can use this background: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. Now, I have a new situation: Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to make changes to their diets. Michael took this advice to heart, and reduced the levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol he consumed. Robert, on the other hand, continued to consume high levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol. Answer this question please: Who will be at lower risk for atherosclerosis in the future? A:","completion":"Michael will be at a lower risk for atherosclerosis in the future.

On the other hand, Robert's continued consumption of high levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol will likely contribute to higher LDL cholesterol levels and increase his risk of atherosclerosis and related health problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How should I treat my daughter if she feels left out for not having a phone like her friends? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choose your answer from: + no. + yes.","completion":"No, these two questions are inquiring about different information. I will provide detailed answers for both questions. 1. How do I find out if she likes you by watching her behavior? To understand if someone likes you by watching their behavior, pay attention to the following signs: a. Body language: Look for open body language like uncrossed arms, and leaning in during conversations. Also, observe if she is mirroring your movements, which shows that she is subconsciously trying to connect with you. b. Eye contact: Maintaining eye contact is a sign of interest, so if she frequently makes and holds eye contact, it is possible she has an interest in you. c. Physical touch: If she often initiates physical contact, such as a touch on the arm or a hug, she might be expressing her affection towards you. d. Laughter: Take note if she laughs at your jokes or finds humor in even the most mundane things you say. This can indicate her interest in you. e. Engaged in conversation: She will actively participate in conversations, offering her opinions or asking questions about your life. Active listening is also a sign of interest. f. Seeking your attention: She may drop hints or create situations where you both can interact or spend time together, indicating her desire to be closer to you. g. Mentioning shared interests: If she continually brings up activities or interests you both share, she might be trying to create a stronger bond with you. Remember, it is important to consider the context of the situation and the individual's personality. Some people may be shy or introverted and not demonstrate these behaviors even if they do like you. 2. How should I treat my daughter if she feels left out for not having a phone like her friends? If your daughter feels left out because she does not have a phone like her friends, you can take the following steps to support and address her feelings: a. Validate her feelings: Acknowledge her emotions and let her know that you understand her feelings of being left out. b. Communicate your concerns: Explain your reasons for not providing her with a phone, whether it's related to finances, age-appropriateness, or any other concerns. Be honest and clear about your reasons. c. Offer alternatives: Suggest alternative ways for her to stay connected with her friends, such as using a home phone, computer, or tablet for communication. d. Encourage face-to-face interactions: Promote in-person gatherings with her peers, encouraging her to develop strong bonds and support networks. e. Develop a plan: If you are open to providing a phone in the future, discuss a plan with her, including any requirements or expectations, such as completing chores or maintaining good grades. f. Discuss peer pressure: Talk to your daughter about the influence of peer pressure and encourage her to develop independence, emphasizing the importance of making choices based on her individual needs and values rather than trying to fit in with her friends.

Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst.

In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014.

For every day that passed, she would rise with the sun, armed with her watering can, garden gloves, and an unfaltering dedication. This was her ritual, her connection to her grandmother. She took care of the peonies like her own children, tending to the plants with an abundance of love and kindness. She could perceive them growing stronger and taller with each passing week. During this time, she discovered a deep gratification and tranquility in this daily act. Not only did she foster life, but she found her own life enriched with purpose, contentment, and a renewed connection with nature. Furthermore, gardening, a hobby acquired from her grandmother, was an activity that also provided her mental peace and stability. This step allowed her to forge a connection with her grandmother's love for gardening and nature, retain her grandmother's memory, and develop a sense of calmness and a multilayered bond with nature. One day, the first bud bloomed, revealing seemingly infinite layers of delicate petals with stunning shades of pink. The sight was breathtaking. She felt her eyes welling up with tears while she traced the soft petals gently. It was a moment of high emotional content - a sense of pride for her labor, a feeling of loss over her grandmother's absence, and immense love for the bond they shared. The continuity of the story involves emotions, the beauty of nature coming to life, and the tale of a bond that is alive and thriving through a legacy of love. This legacy is carried forward not just through the unforgettable memories of the woman's grandmother but also through the act of caring for peonies. The selection of peonies over azaleas symbolizes personal emotions and memories associated with the past, which associates different dimensions to the woman's gardening journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is panicking happens, how will it affect a person may loses consciousness. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a person panicking can have an effect (both direct and indirect) on the process of respiration and potentially lead to the person losing consciousness. Here's a step-by-step analysis of what happens: 1. The person starts panicking, which leads to an increase in their breathing rate. Rapid, shallow breathing, known as hyperventilation, can occur. 2. Hyperventilation causes the person to take in more oxygen than needed, and exhale an excessive amount of carbon dioxide. This disturbs the balance of gases in the body, which can lead to lower levels of carbon dioxide circulating in the blood. 3. The reduced level of carbon dioxide in the blood causes blood vessels in the brain to constrict. This constriction reduces the supply of oxygen to the brain. 4. The lack of oxygen in the brain impairs its ability to function properly, causing the person to feel lightheaded or dizzy. If the situation escalates and the oxygen supply remains inadequate, there is a possibility that the person may lose consciousness. In conclusion, panicking can directly affect the process of respiration, with the resultant hyperventilation leading to an imbalance in the body's oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. This imbalance then indirectly impacts the oxygen supply to the brain, potentially leading to a loss of consciousness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is the system in field hockey Suggested answer: A popular variant of field hockey is indoor hockey , which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey. Should I validate this answer? OPTIONS: (A). No (B). Yes A:","completion":"(A). No The suggested answer provided does not accurately address the question regarding the \\"system\\" in field hockey. Instead, it diverts attention to a variant of field hockey – indoor hockey. An appropriate response to the question should focus on explaining the system that governs field hockey in terms of rules, playing structure, and strategies. Here is a possible answer: Field hockey is a sport played between two teams, each consisting of 11 players, including a goalkeeper. The main objective is to score more goals than the opposing team. The game is played in two halves, each one lasting 35 minutes, with a 5 to 10-minute break between the halves called halftime. The game starts with a pass-back at the center of the field, and the players use their curved sticks to control, pass, and shoot the ball. The system of field hockey primarily involves understanding and implementing strategic formations, which may vary depending on the team's approach and coaching style. A common formation is the 4-4-2, where there are four defenders, four midfielders, and two forwards. Other formations include 3-5-2 and 5-3-2, which affect the allocation of players to defensive, midfield, and attacking roles. Teams generally adopt both offensive and defensive strategies during a match, which involves quick passing, overlapping runs, and utilizing space efficiently. Positioning, communication, and teamwork play a crucial role in the success of the team's system. Furthermore, players must adhere to various rules stipulated by the International Hockey Federation (FIH), including staying within the boundaries of the playing field and not obstructing opponents' moves. When verifying answers generated by an automatic system, it's crucial to ensure that they stay on-topic and sufficiently address the specific question asked.

Q: Passage: Thomas Stephen Kenan (February 12, 1838 – December 23, 1911) was a Confederate soldier, and later a politician. His parents were Sarah Rebecca Graham and Owen Rand Kenan; he was the grandson of U.S. Congressman Thomas Kenan and great-grandson of Revolutionary War general James Kenan. He started his education in Duplin County, North Carolina at Old Grove Academy in Kenansville (the town was named for his great-grandfather in 1818). Later he spent a year at Central Military Institute in Selma, Alabama. Thomas spent his freshman year of college at Wake Forest in June. Thomas then transferred his sophomore year to the University of North Carolina, where he would graduate in 1857. He studied law for two years with Judge Pearson at Richmond Hill where he practiced law in Kenansville. After graduation and during the Civil War he became Captain of the Duplin Rifles in the Confederate States Army, elected lieutenant colonel of the 43rd North Carolina Infantry Regiment in April 1862, and was promoted to colonel later that year. He was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg. While on an ambulance train, he and his older brother James Kenan were both captured; they were then imprisoned on Johnson's Island, Ohio. On March 22, 1865, he was released on parole but never switched sides during the war. On his return home he was elected to the state legislature from 1865 to 1867. Later that year he ran for Congress and lost. Not letting that defeat end his political career, he moved to Wilson, North Carolina, where he became mayor and was elected North Carolina Attorney General, serving from 1877 to 1885. In May 1868 he married Miss Sallie Dortch, but they had no children; Sallie died in 1916.

See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere.

Photos of the sign — whose magnetized letters spelled out “Dicember 2014” and “progress reepor” — were circulated on social media and to school board members by Corey Teague, another board member. Teague said he did not want the principal, Antoinette Young, disciplined, but only wanted to draw attention to a situation that needed to be addressed. Young was already under review for unrelated performance issues, NorthJersey.com also reported. The lettering was placed by a custodian and the sign was near an entrance not normally used by staff, officials said. Paul Milo may be reached at pmilo@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @PaulMilo2. Find NJ.com on Facebook. ||||| PATERSON, N.J. (CBSNewYork) — Some serious misspellings on a school sign may have cost a principal her position. It’s prominently positioned over the entryway at Paterson’s Public School Number 20, but it took more than a week for anyone to take notice and fix the glaring mistakes on the school’s sign. As CBS2’s Vanessa Murdock reported, the controversial sign included misspellings of the words ‘December’ and ‘reports’ which were spelled ‘Dicember’ and ‘reepor’ respectively. The number ‘1’ was also backwards. “How horrible. How are you going to teach the kids? How are you going to teach the kids when you can’t spell the simple month of December?” Betty Mack said. It took a Facebook for someone to actually bring it to the school’s attention. That someone was parent and Paterson Board of Education member Corey Teague. At first, Teague thought the picture was fake. “At first I didn’t believe it was, i thought it was PhotoShopped or something,” Teague said. When he found out it was the real deal, he became angry. “We can’t assume because it’s an urban district — inner-city — that things like this can be swept over. If it were a suburban neighborhood parents would be outraged, disgusted,” Teague said. Teague’s goal is to make sure that no sign posted on a Paterson school looks like this one again, but there may have been more fallout than intended. The principal, Antoinette Young, was reassigned. The district wouldn’t confirm that the misspellings were the reason for her move, and some parents said the principal shouldn’t take the fall for someone else’s misspellings. “They don’t talk about all the good things she’s done with the kids. We’re sad to see her go,” Linda Martinez said. A district spokesperson told CBS2 that Principal Young has been reassigned as a vice principal to another school.

Heather Cagle, who taught at Wells Middle School in Catoosa, allegedly packed 11 of her students into her Honda Accord last October for a trip to Walmart for snacks, according to Fox 23. Seven of the kids piled into the backseat, two rode in front, and two 12-year-old girls were locked in the trunk. She did not have parental or school permission for the snack quest. “It was a terrible mistake,” she told the school board Wednesday. “I didn't want to hurt anyone.

Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.\\", answer the following question.

This development comes as tensions run high between the EU member states, particularly Poland, and Germany, due to ongoing disagreements over various pressing issues within the union. Background: The EU summit fiasco refers to the recent meeting of European Union leaders, where negotiations crumbled under the weight of internal disputes, disappointing expectations. The summit, originally intended to present the face of a united and collaborative European Union, showcased deep divisions between member states - placing significant strain on the already fragile relationships between countries. Germany, always seen as the economic powerhouse and leader of the Union, expected to exert its influence over the smaller, less powerful countries in the EU at the summit. However, this backfired and highlighted the growing division between the more dominant nations and the smaller members they often disregard. Poland and the EU Summit Fiasco: Poland played a significant role in the EU summit's unraveling due to its staunch opposition towards various policies and decisions on the table. The conservative Polish government has been critical of the EU, taking issue with any infringement on national sovereignty they perceive as detrimental to their way of life. Offering resistance to policies regarding the environment, rule of law, and migration among others, Poland has gained a reputation for being a thorn in the side of European unity. Furthermore, the country has also been accused of defying EU rulings when it comes to the independence of the judiciary. German Press Attacks: Following the fiasco, German media outlets have specifically targeted Poland, blaming the country for its role in the failure of the summit. Commentators have accused the Polish government of sabotaging European integration and unity, and aiming to weaken its position by siding with Eurosceptic forces. Headlines have accused Poland of \\"crossing a line\\" and \\"driving a wedge\\" between EU member states, suggesting the country is threatening the very foundations of the Union. These inflammatory statements have served to fuel public animosity, leading to deteriorating relations between the two neighbors. Poland Responds to Attacks: As accusations mount, Poland remains defiant, asserting its commitment to the EU while maintaining its autonomy and right to prioritize national interests. It has rejected claims that it aims to damage the Union and has called for respect and equal treatment for all EU member states, regardless of their size. The Polish government has argued that the EU should remain a democratic institution where the will of the people should be respected, insisting that its stance is not meant to provoke hostility but rather to ensure the protection of Polish interests. Conclusion: The German press's harsh criticism of Poland and its role in the EU summit fiasco has further escalated tensions between the two neighboring nations and within the EU as a whole. While Germany seeks to maintain its influence and control over the direction the European Union takes, Poland and other smaller members demand a more equal, democratic system. As Germany continues to flex its economic and political muscles, Poland has proven to be a challenging ally for the EU and its more dominant members. Neither side is showing signs of backing down, and the likelihood of reaching a compromise or calming the tensions seems unclear. The ongoing rift between Germany, Poland, and other countries within the EU has left leaders scrambling to find common ground and secure unity among its members. The EU summit fiasco is a striking reminder of the fragility of this unity and the precarious balance required to maintain it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.

When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland. - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere. - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand.

Background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Paragraph: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which place plant roots would play greater role in soil development, Kenya or Tanzania? Answer:","completion":"Plant roots would play a greater role in soil development in Kenya. This is because, in grasslands like those in Kenya, much of the organic matter added to the soil comes from the deep, fibrous root systems of grasses. Grass root systems contribute significantly to the development of the thicker A horizon and the deeper distribution of organic matter in the soil. In contrast, forests like those in Tanzania rely more on the accumulation of organic matter from fallen leaves on the forest floor, which mostly contributes to the O horizon and a thinner A horizon. Therefore, plant roots play a more significant role in soil development in Kenya as compared to Tanzania."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article:","completion":"Title: Enhancing Productivity and Positivity through Time Management and Mindful Practices Introduction In today's fast-paced work environment, it is becoming increasingly important for professionals to manage both their time and emotional well-being effectively. By paying attention to these aspects, individuals can optimize their productivity and job satisfaction. In this article, we will discuss various tips and strategies that can help you stay focused and prepared, manage your schedule efficiently, and keep a positive mindset throughout the day. 1. Preparation is key The first step to a successful and productive day is to be prepared. This involves carefully reviewing your schedule and planning tasks well in advance. Take time each week to assess your work commitments, meetings, and personal activities, ensuring that you have a comprehensive understanding of what needs to be done. This will allow you to prioritize tasks, allocate time effectively, and stay organized. 2. Utilize your commute time wisely For many individuals, commuting can be a valuable opportunity to collect their thoughts and set the tone for the day. As you travel to work, dedicate some time to mentally prepare by focusing on your energy and envisioning a productive day ahead. This could involve meditating, deep breathing exercises, or simply visualizing the successful completion of tasks. In doing so, you can create a positive mindset that will help you tackle challenges with enthusiasm and determination. 3. Practice active listening and maintain a positive attitude Active listening and maintaining a positive attitude throughout the day go hand in hand in maximizing productivity. Listening empathetically to your colleagues, clients, and supervisors enables you to understand their needs and concerns better, leading to more successful collaborations and problem-solving.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does word \\"repair\\" have the same meaning in the following two sentences? To repair a shattered fortune. To repair to sanctuary for safety.","completion":"No, the word \\"repair\\" does not have the same meaning in these two sentences. In English, the word \\"repair\\" can be used both as a verb and a noun. In the first sentence, \\"repair\\" is used as a verb in its common, primary meaning, which is to restore something that has been damaged or is in need of fixing. On the other hand, the second sentence uses the verb \\"repair\\" in an archaic, less common meaning, which is to go to a particular place or destination. Let's look at the meanings and context of each sentence individually: 1. To repair a shattered fortune. In this sentence, \\"repair\\" means to fix, mend, or restore something to its original condition. The phrase \\"shattered fortune\\" suggests that a person's financial situation or wealth has been severely damaged, perhaps due to a series of unfortunate events or poor decisions. The act of repairing a shattered fortune would involve making efforts, implementing strategies or taking actions to improve the financial situation and recover the lost wealth. 2. To repair to sanctuary for safety. In this sentence, \\"repair\\" means to go or move oneself to a particular place. The phrase \\"to sanctuary for safety\\" suggests that a person is going to or seeking a specific location, like a sanctuary, in order to find protection, refuge, or safety. Sanctuaries often provide a safe space, where people, animals, or objects can remain secure from harm or danger. Here, the term \\"repair\\" is used in the sense of heading towards a sanctuary for the purpose of seeking safety. This usage is archaic and not commonly used in current English, and you might typically encounter it in historical texts or literature. In summary, the word \\"repair\\" has two different meanings in these sentences. In the first sentence, it pertains to fixing a broken situation (specifically, a financial one), while in the second sentence, it refers to an archaic use of the term, meaning to go or move to a designated location for the purpose of seeking safety or protection. These distinct meanings demonstrate the flexibility and nuances of language, where context plays a significant role in defining the sense of a given word."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the album \\"Death of a Clown\\" was on? ? The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \\"Autumn Almanac\\", in early October.

In Eastern Antarctica, seed ferns or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. Synapsids, commonly known as \\"mammal-like reptiles\\", were common in Antarctica during the Early Triassic and included forms such as Lystrosaurus. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the Jurassic period (206–146 Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. Ginkgo trees, conifers, bennettites, horsetails, ferns and cycads were plentiful during this period. In West Antarctica, coniferous forests dominated through the entire Cretaceous period (146–66 Ma), though southern beech became more prominent towards the end of this period.
