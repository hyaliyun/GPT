The terrorists seized the politicians. Choose from: (1). different meanings; (2). the same meaning;","completion":"(2). the same meaning. In both sentences, the word \\"seize\\" is used to convey the act of taking control or possession of someone by force or without their consent. Although the context and subjects involved in each sentence are different—rebels and terrorists, civilians and politicians—the essential meaning of the word \\"seize\\" remains the same. In the first sentence, \\"The rebels threaten to seize civilian hostages,\\" the rebels intend to take control of civilians and use them as hostages. This suggests that they would hold them as leverage or bargaining chips, typically in pursuit of their goals or demands. In the second sentence, \\"The terrorists seized the politicians,\\" the act of seizing has already occurred, with the terrorists successfully taking control of the politicians. The intention behind seizing the politicians in this instance may be similar to the first example, potentially to use them as leverage, make demands, or achieve a specific goal. While the situations described in both sentences vary, the underlying meaning of the word \\"seize\\" is consistent: to forcibly take control or possession of someone or something."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder. While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for \\"Jeremy\\", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for \\"Black\\" in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own interpretations of the song, stating that \\"Before music videos first came out, you'd listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you'd come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression.\\" The United States Department of Justice was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company.

Background: The Colbert Report () is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor. Context: The character first made appearances on the short-lived sketch comedy series The Dana Carvey Show in 1996, described as \\"a self-important, trench-coated reporter who does on-location stories in a way that suggests his own presence is the real scoop.\\" When The Daily Show ran short on time, a short piece starring Colbert, advertising a fictional program titled The Colbert Report, was added into the program. In these sketches, Colbert began to amplify his character to parody news pundits. Colbert anchored many sketches in his persona, including \\"Even Stepvhen\\", in which he debated current issues with fellow correspondent Steve Carell, often devolving into petty name-calling and insults. Colbert and Carell were viewed as potential breakout stars by staff, and when Carell left the series in 2004 to start a US version of The Office, Comedy Central made attempts to keep Colbert at the network. Stewart and Karlin were already looking to expand the Daily Show franchise and their production company, Busboy. The duo supposedly came up with the idea for The Colbert Report after watching coverage of the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Bill O'Reilly. Colbert met with network president Doug Herzog the day following the 2004 Emmy Awards to first discuss the concept. The one-line pitch Colbert, Karlin and Stewart developed was \\"Our version of the O'Reilly Factor with Stephen Colbert.\\" Herzog committed to an eight-week tryout period without a pilot. By the time of the 2004 election, the character was fully developed. In creating the character, which is designed to be repellant but entertaining, Colbert conferred with Stewart and Karlin. In expressing his hope that his character not be \\"an asshole,\\" Stewart remarked, \\"You're not an asshole. You're an idiot. There's a difference.\\" Head writer Allison Silverman reiterated this trait in a later interview, commenting, \\"There is an essential innocence to his character.\\" Colbert initially felt the character might not be sustainable in a longer format. Despite this, The Colbert Report was designed as an extension of the satiric goals of The Daily Show, combining it with general silliness and character-driven humor. To make sure there was no overlap in subject matter with The Daily Show, Karlin made trips between the studios during the show's early days to supervise scripts. For the first several years of the program, Colbert made an appearance at the end of each Daily Show in split-screen, having a short discussion with Stewart preceding his show. Question: What do you find most interesting in the article? Answer:","completion":"One of the most interesting aspects of the article is the evolution and development of Stephen Colbert's character as a satirical news pundit. The character's beginnings on The Dana Carvey Show and its transformation and amplification in The Daily Show, leading to the creation of The Colbert Report, showcase the creative process behind this iconic character. Additionally, it's fascinating to see how the collaboration between Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, and Ben Karlin led to the successful and influential show, as well as the specific influence of the Bill O'Reilly sexual harassment lawsuit in sparking the idea for The Colbert Report."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I think that one of the people who caused me the most misery for the longest was someone that I’ll call “Luna”. So, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you’re talking to someone like that and you’re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren’t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say “This is your fault”. Well, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive. So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all. But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing. But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade. So for that entire period of time, she certainly wasn’t the only source of misery for me, but she made me feel way worse than I would have if I hadn’t been friends with her.

Context: U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Question: Why did Donald Trump ask his supporters to not pay attention to Democrats?

The incumbent monarch, King Carl XVI Gustaf, is head of the Royal Court. - During the 6th millennium BC, agriculture spread from the Balkans to Italy and Eastern Europe, and also from Mesopotamia to Egypt. World population was essentially stable at numbers ranging between approximately 5 and 7 million. - Skansen (the Sconce) is the first open-air museum and zoo in Sweden and is located on the island Djurgården in Stockholm, Sweden. It was opened on 11 October 1891 by Artur Hazelius (18331901) to show the way of life in the different parts of Sweden before the industrial era. - The Stockholm archipelago is the largest archipelago in Sweden, and the second-largest archipelago in the Baltic Sea (the largest being across the Baltic in Finland). - Djurgården or, more officially, Kungliga Djurgården is an island in central Stockholm. Djurgården is home to historical buildings and monuments, museums, galleries, the amusement park Gröna Lund, the open-air museum Skansen, the small residential area \\"Djurgårdsstaden\\", yacht harbours, and extensive stretches of forest and meadows. It is one of the Stockholmers' favorite recreation areas and tourist destinations alike, attracting over 10 million visitors per year, of which some 5 million come to visit the museums and amusement park. The island belongs to the National City park founded in 1995. Since the 15th century the Swedish monarch has owned or held the right of disposition of Royal Djurgården. Today, this right is exercised by the Royal Djurgården Administration which is a part of the Royal Court of Sweden. - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands). - Stockholm County (\\"Stockholms län\\") is a county or \\"län\\" (in Swedish) on the Baltic sea coast of Sweden. It borders Uppsala County and Södermanland County. It also borders Mälaren and the Baltic Sea. The city of Stockholm is the capital of Sweden. Stockholm County is divided by the historic provinces of Uppland (Roslagen) and Södermanland (Södertörn). More than one fifth of the Swedish population lives in the county. Stockholm County is also one of the statistical \\"riksområden\\" (national areas) according to , Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics within the EU. With more than two million inhabitants, Stockholm is the most densely populated county of Sweden. - Stockholm (or ) is the capital of Sweden and the most populous city in the Nordic countries; 932,917 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.5 million in the urban area, and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area. The city is spread across 14 islands on the coast in the southeast of Sweden at the mouth of Lake Mälaren, by the Stockholm archipelago and the Baltic Sea. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by a Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. It is also the capital of Stockholm County. - Rosendal Palace ( Swedish : Rosendals slott ) is a Swedish palace pavilion located at the Djurgården , an island in central Stockholm . It was built between 1823 and 1827 for King Karl XIV Johan , the first Bernadotte King of Sweden . It was intended as an escape from the formalities of court life at the Royal Palace . Rosendal Palace was largely designed by Fredrik Blom , one of the leading architects of the time , who received a royal commission to draw and build the palace building after the original buildings burned down . Fredrik August Lidströmer , Stockholm 's City Architect from 1818 to 1824 , had been King Karl XIV Johan 's primary architect at the construction of the original Rosendal Palace . After it burned down in 1819 , Lidströmer also created the initial drawings for the replacement palace . These were then adapted and redrawn by Fredrik Blom , who had been an assistant to Jonas Lidströmer , father of Fredrik August Lidströmer . The Queen 's Pavilion at Rosendal Palace ( Swedish : Drottningpaviljongen ) ) and Guard 's Cottage ( Swedish : Vaktstugan ) remained entirely the work of Fredrik August Lidströmer . The creation of the Rosendal Palace in the 1820s marked the beginning of the development of Djurgården into a stately residential area . When King Oskar II died in 1907 , his heirs decided to make Rosendal Palace a museum of the Karl Johan period and of the life of Karl XIV Johan . This makes Rosendal Palace a unique documentation of the European Empire style , in Sweden also known as the Karl Johan style . The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared in other parts of Europe . The palace stands today largely as it did in Karl XIV Johan 's lifetime . During the summer months the palace is open to visitors for guided tours . - Biography. Early life. It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers Eskil, Karl, and Bengt were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country.

Plains Indians, Interior Plains Indians or Indigenous people of the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies are the Native American tribes and First Nation band governments who have traditionally lived on the greater Interior Plains (i.e. the Great Plains and the Canadian Prairies) in North America. Their historic nomadic culture and development of equestrian culture and resistance to domination by the government and military forces of Canada and the United States have made the Plains Indian culture groups an archetype in literature and art for American Indians everywhere. Plains Indians are usually divided into two broad classifications which overlap to some degree. The first group became a fully nomadic horse culture during the 18th and 19th centuries, following the vast herds of buffalo, although some tribes occasionally engaged in agriculture. The earliest Spanish explorers in the 16th century did not find the Plains Indians especially warlike. The Wichita in Kansas and Oklahoma lived in dispersed settlements with no defensive works. The Spanish initially had friendly contacts with the Apache (Querechos) in the Texas Panhandle. Three factors led to a growing importance of warfare in Plains Indian culture. First, was the Spanish colonization of New Mexico which stimulated raids and counter-raids by Spaniards and Indians for goods and slaves. Second, was the contact of the Indians with French fur traders which increased rivalry among Indian tribes to control trade and trade routes. Third, was the acquisition of the horse and the greater mobility it afforded the Plains Indians. What evolved among the Plains Indians from the 17th to the late 19th century was warfare as both a means of livelihood and a sport. The Plains Indians raided each other, the Spanish colonies, and, increasingly, the encroaching frontier of the Anglos for horses, and other property. They acquired guns and other European goods primarily by trade. Their principal trading products were buffalo hides and beaver pelts. Although they could be tenacious in defense, Plains Indians warriors took the offensive mostly for material gain and individual prestige. The highest military honors were for \\"counting coup\\"--touching a live enemy. Battles between Indians often consisted of opposing warriors demonstrating their bravery rather than attempting to achieve concrete military objectives. The emphasis was on ambush and hit and run actions rather than closing with an enemy. Success was often counted by the number of horses or property obtained in the raid. Casualties were usually light. \\"Indians consider it foolhardiness to make an attack where it is certain some of them will be killed.\\" Due to their mobility, endurance, horsemanship, and knowledge of the vast plains that were their domain, the Plains Indians were often victors in their battles against the U.S. army in the American era from 1803 to about 1890. However, although Indians won many battles, they could not undertake lengthy campaigns. Indian armies could only be assembled for brief periods of time as warriors also had to hunt for food for their families. The exception to that was raids into Mexico by the Comanche and their allies in which the raiders often subsisted for months off the riches of Mexican haciendas and settlements. The basic weapon of the Indian warrior was the short, stout bow, designed for use on horseback and deadly, but only at short range. Guns were usually in short supply and ammunition scarce for Native warriors.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who did the plains indians have battles with","completion":"The Plains Indians had battles with different groups during their history. According to the shared information, they had conflicts with the Spanish during the Spanish colonization of New Mexico, which led to raids and counter-raids for goods and slaves. The contact with French fur traders also resulted in hostilities as there was increased rivalry among Indian tribes to control trade and trade routes. As the expansion of colonialism continued, the Plains Indians increasingly came into conflict with the encroaching frontier of the Anglos (another name for European settlers, particularly of English descent). The Plains Indians also had warfare with different tribes, as is evidenced by mention of intertribal raids for horses and other properties. Notably, the period from 1803 to about 1890 was marked by frequent battles against the U.S. army. The quote, \\"Due to their mobility, endurance, horsemanship, and knowledge of the vast plains that were their domain, the Plains Indians were often victors in their battles against the U.S. army in the American era from 1803 to about 1890\\", denotes this period of conflict with the U.S. army. Furthermore, The Plains Indians, specifically the Comanche and their allies, also launched raids into Mexico, with the quote detailing: \\"The exception to that was raids into Mexico by the Comanche and their allies in which the raiders often subsisted for months off the riches of Mexican haciendas and settlements.\\" Therefore, the battles of the Plains Indians spanned across different groups and periods, largely shaped by the colonial and territorial expansions of foreign powers, and also encompassing conflicts with neighboring tribes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is an exciting development in the region that is poised to rekindle the art of whisky production, draw thriving tourism, and reawaken a part of the area's proud heritage. The proposed distillery will stand on a former industrial site, providing a blend of the old and the new, honoring the history of the Borders while embracing its future as a premier whisky producer. History of Whisky Production in the Borders The Borders, an area rich in history and blessed with natural resources, were once home to thriving whisky production. Distilleries thrived in this region until the introduction of the Excise Act in the early 1800s, which led to the closure of many small-scale, independent operations. Now, nearly 180 years after the last distillery closed its doors, the Borders are set to reclaim their place as a center of whisky production. The Former Industrial Site The new distillery will be constructed on a former industrial site, which offers a fitting location as it blends the region's proud industrial heritage with its future as a whisky producing powerhouse. This sustainable approach ensures that valuable land is preserved while the disused land is revitalized, breathing new life into an already historical location. The Investment and Economic Impact The establishment of a new whisky distillery carries profound economic implications for the Borders. In addition to providing jobs directly related to production, sales, and management of the distillery, it will create numerous indirect opportunities for employment in fields ranging from tourism to logistics. This economic impact is expected to reverberate throughout the region, bolstering local businesses and improving the overall quality of life for residents. The Distillery Experience With many curious visitors and connoisseurs expected to flock to the distillery once it's operational, the distillery will serve as a hub of whisky education and appreciation. Not only will guests have the opportunity to experience firsthand how whisky is made with traditional methods, but they will also learn about the history of the industry in the Borders. By preserving and promoting the cultural heritage of the region, the distillery will also contribute to the growth and continuity of this remarkable tradition. Environmental Stewardship and the Use of Local Resources Beyond economic benefits, the new distillery will also emphasize environmental stewardship and the use of local resources. Production will prioritize sustainable practices that minimize the environmental footprint of the facility, promote soil health, and conserve water. Furthermore, the whisky will be produced with high-quality, local grains and water sources, ensuring the unique flavor profile that can only come from the Borders region. Conclusion The proposed whisky distillery heralds a renaissance for Borders whisky production and brings forth the potential to revitalize the regional economy, breathe new life into former industrial sites, and reintroduce the rich whisky-making heritage of the region to the world. With environmental sustainability at its core and a focus on honoring the local landscape and history, the distillery will form a cornerstone of industry, tourism, and culture for generations to come. The time is ripe for a resurgence of whisky production in the Borders, and the founding of this new distillery signals a bright and prosperous future for the area and its proud people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's begin solving the equation 0 = 153*p - 80 + 29 - 102 for p. Step 1: Combine like terms on one side of the equation. 0 = 153*p - 80 + 29 - 102 There are three constants: -80, 29, and -102. To combine them: -80 + 29 - 102 = -153 The updated equation becomes: 0 = 153*p - 153 Step 2: Add or subtract constants on the other side of the equation. To get rid of the constant on the right side of the equation, we will add 153 to both sides: 0 + 153 = 153*p - 153 + 153 Which can be simplified to: 153 = 153*p Step 3: Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable.

Here is a news article: A Dutch man barely out of his teens is leading one of the most ambitious ocean cleanup efforts ever: to halve the amount of plastic debris floating in the Pacific within a decade. The man’s name is Boyan Slat, and he’s come up with a pretty ingenious way of doing it. Instead of clamoring around the globe on a never-ending junk hunt, he wants the ocean to “clean itself.” Advertisement Every year, 8 million tons of plastic are dumped into the oceans. Slat’s plan is to place enormous floating barriers in rotating tidal locations around the globe (called gyres), and let the plastic waste naturally flow into capture. These barriers aren’t nets—sea life gets tangled in those. They’re big, V-shaped buffers anchored by floating booms. Slat’s nonprofit, the Ocean Cleanup, says the current will flow underneath those booms, where animals will be carried through safely. The buoyant plastic is funneled above and concentrates at the water’s surface along the barriers for easy gathering and disposal. Advertisement Last month, it was announced that this ocean-cleaning system—which the company says is the world’s first—will be deployed in 2016. They’re planning to station it near the Japanese island of Tsushima, situated in between Japan’s Nagasaki prefecture and South Korea. The detritus-catching apparatus will be 6,500 feet wide and is being called the longest floating structure ever placed in the ocean. Eventually, more of these storm-resistant, plastic-gathering structures will be placed around the world, if all goes according to plan. This August, meanwhile, the Ocean Cleanup is sending 50 vessels to scour the area between Hawaii and California to make the first hi-res map of plastic floating in the Pacific. Advertisement Slat leads a team of 100 oceanographers, naval engineers, translators, designers, and others. He’s also getting support from key political figures, like the mayor of Tsushima and the mayor of Los Angeles. The Ocean Cleanup started with a crowdfunding campaign last year that raised 2 million. Pretty incredible for a 20-year-old with a big idea. Concept art credits: The Ocean Cleanup ||||| The world's first system designed to rid the oceans of plastic pollution will be deployed near Japan in 2016, with the aim of eventually capturing half of the plastic found in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — a large concentration of marine debris located between Hawaii and California. Boyan Slat, the 20-year-old Dutch CEO of The Ocean Cleanup, an organization dedicated to cleaning the world’s oceans, designed the system dubbed The Ocean Cleanup Array. “I’ve always been interested in technology, and I was launching rockets at 12 years old,” Slat said. “Eventually I started studying aerospace engineering, but I dropped out to try to develop this ocean clean up idea.” He said his inspiration for the organization came after a diving holiday in Greece where he realized he was coming across more plastic bags than fish. “I wondered, ‘Why can’t we clean this up?’” Slat said. Plastic debris, most of it in the form of tiny beads known as microplastics, can be found on up to 88 percent of the surface of all five oceans, according to a recent study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Because of swirling ocean currents, known as gyres, this plastic pollution has become concentrated in certain areas. In other cases, ocean currents send plastic pollution toward certain islands or coastal areas in greater concentration than others. One such area is the Japanese island of Tsushima. “The reason we picked that location is because the current and wave conditions are very favorable for our tests, and there really is a lot of plastic,” Slat said. “The island where we performed the test sees 30,000 cubic meters of trash wash ashore per year.” So much plastic washes up on Tsushima’s shores that both the Japanese government and the island’s residents have agreed to work with The Ocean Cleanup on its pilot project planned for 2016. The Ocean Cleanup Array — based on research by a team of 100 scientists and engineers and funded by a crowd-funding campaign — is a long, floating barrier that is moored to the seabed in an area that plastic debris gathers due to ocean currents, Slat said. As currents move plastic trash toward the area, the barrier blocks and gathers it onto a collection platform. The array will span over 1 mile, making it the longest floating structure ever deployed in the ocean, according to a press release by The Ocean Cleanup. The system works because most plastic trash floating in the ocean is found in the top two meters of the water, Slat discovered after leading four expeditions in different ocean locations to measure how deep the plastic could be found. The array will be operational for two years, catching plastic before it reaches the shores of Tsushima, which is currently researching whether it can use the material for an energy source. If the pilot project is successful, The Ocean Cleanup will begin a series of deployments of arrays of increasing scale, Slat said. Within five years, the organization aims to deploy a 62-mile-long array that will be capable of capturing about half of the trash in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, Slat said. According to a feasibility study conducted by the team of 100 scientists and engineers working with Slat, the giant array will be able to do that over 10 years. Critics argue that prevention and interception — stopping the plastic trash before it reaches waterways and oceans — is a more sustainable way to stop ocean pollution. Tony Haymet, a professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego, said peer-reviewed studies from his former students’ 2009 SEAPLEX expedition showed that nearly all plastic pollution in the oceans is in microplastic form — “smaller than the size of about half a little finger nail.” No system is able to extract the microplastic, Haymet said in previous comments. “As far as I know — sadly — this remains true today,” Haymet said. “It’s a horribly tricky issue.” Besides being hard to filter, microplastic — either from microbeads in popular beauty products or the broken down pieces of larger plastic items — gets into the stomachs of small fish, which are then eaten by medium-size fish, and on up the food chain, Haymet said. In order to better the world’s understanding of the scale and size of plastic pollution in the Pacific Ocean, The Ocean Cleanup will carry out a “mega expedition” in August to measure the amount of trash found in the ocean between California and Hawaii. “Up to 50 vessels will go to the Patch, thereby becoming the largest research expedition in history,” Slat said. The ships will stay there for about three weeks, taking measurements of the amount and size of plastic contained in the area. “In that period we will take more measurements [of the Patch] than in the past 40 years combined,” Slat said. The Ocean Cleanup has recruiters throughout the U.S. looking for people with boats to join the expedition. They already have 15 confirmed, and a little over two months until the trip begins. “It’s 63 days to go, so the pressure is on,” Slat said. ||||| Take advantage of natural oceanic forces The Ocean Cleanup is developing a passive system, using the natural oceanic forces to catch and concentrate the plastic. Both the plastic and system are being carried by the current. However, wind and waves propel only the system, as the floater sits just above the water surface, while the plastic is primarily just beneath it. The system thus moves faster than the plastic, allowing the plastic to be captured. ||||| This site makes use of third-party cookies for analytics.

The company has announced that in 2016, it will launch “the world’s first ocean cleaning system.” The Ocean Cleanup “Taking care of the world’s ocean garbage problem is one of the largest environmental challenges mankind faces today,” Boyan said. “This deployment will enable us to study the system’s efficiency and durability over time.” .@BoyanSlat and Tsushima Island’s mayor sign Mutual Agreement for the coastal pilot. pic.twitter.com/J3aoqhi7p8 — The Ocean Cleanup (@TheOceanCleanup) May 28, 2015 So what exactly is the plan? Massive floating barriers called “the coastal pilot” will use the ocean’s currents to collect plastic debris. These barriers, “the longest floating structure ever deployed on the oceans,” will be stationed off Tsushima — an island located between Japan and South Korea. The Ocean Cleanup It’s just the first step in the project’s ambitious plan to clean up our waters. It’ll be a multi-year effort to get our waters back to how they should be: clean, healthy and free of trash. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Boyan Slat, a young Dutch inventor, has set out on an ambitious journey to reduce the amount of plastic debris floating in the Pacific Ocean by half within a decade. His innovative approach involves using natural ocean currents to guide the plastic waste towards floating barriers, replacing the need for global cleanup efforts. According to Slat's plan, massive floating barriers will be placed in rotating tidal locations around the world, known as gyres. These barriers will not be nets, as these tend to entangle marine life. Instead, they will be V-shaped buffers anchored by floating booms. These floating barriers will allow currents to flow beneath the booms, safely carrying animals through while trapping buoyant plastic above the water's surface. In 2016, Slat's organization, the Ocean Cleanup, deployed the first ocean-cleaning system near Tsushima, a Japanese island located between Japan and South Korea. The floating apparatus is 6,500 feet wide and has been called the longest floating structure ever placed in the ocean. If everything goes according to plan, more of these storm-resistant, plastic-gathering structures will be placed around the world. Slat's Ocean Cleanup organization started with a crowdfunding campaign, which raised 2 million. With support from key political figures, such as the mayors of Tsushima and Los Angeles, Slat leads a team of 100 oceanographers, naval engineers, translators, and designers to accomplish this daunting task. The long floating barriers are moored to the seabed in areas where plastic debris gathers due to ocean currents. The system works by utilizing the fact that most plastic trash floating in the ocean is found in the top two meters of the water. The Ocean Cleanup Array spans over one mile and aims to catch plastic before it reaches the shores of Tsushima. If the pilot project proves successful, the organization will deploy arrays of increasing scale over the next five years, with the final goal of deploying a 62-mile-long array to capture about half of the trash in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. While critics argue that prevention and interception are more sustainable methods to stop ocean pollution, the Ocean Cleanup's efforts in using natural ocean currents to capture large-scale plastic waste may prove to be an effective approach in cleaning up the world's oceans over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Here is a 5R rule for us: 1. Reduce If you want to reduce waste, you should use things wisely. Millions of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses a little paper carelessly and throw it out, soon we would not have any trees left. Other things are also being wasted, and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the waste 2. Reuse You should always think of reusing the usable things before throwing them out. Give your clothes you do not use or the ones which are too small to the poor. With a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters. 3. Recycle Bottles, cans and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so, we save lots of time and money. For example, coke cans are sent to a factory, where they are smashed flat and melted and the melted things are made for new coke cans. 4. Recover When you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten apples. You have two choices: one is to throw the whole apple away, or you could cut off the rotten parts and eat the good parts. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food. 5. Repair If one of the legs of your table is broken, you can repair it instead of throwing it away. If you want to change for better ones, It is better for you to sell the old things or give them to other people who can use them after doing some repair.

The ambiance of the place was inviting and cozy, with soft lighting and tastefully arranged decor. We were immediately greeted by the friendly staff who promptly escorted us to our table. Once seated, our attentive server, Emily, handed us the menu and gave us time to make our selections while bringing us our requested drinks. I really appreciated the extensive menu options, offering a diverse range of dishes appealing to all palates. We decided to try the chef's special appetizers, which included the mouth-watering truffled mushroom crostini and sumptuous coconut shrimp. Both items exceeded our expectations, with rich, unique flavors that left us craving more. For our entrees, I ordered the Seared Scallops, my friend had the Braised Short Ribs, and my other friend opted for the Linguine Pescatore. Each dish was presented artfully on our plates, demonstrating the chef's attention to detail. The scallops were cooked to perfection, with a crispy outer layer and tender, succulent meat inside. The short ribs were so tender that they practically melted in our mouths, and their savory sauce paired exceptionally well with the side of garlic mashed potatoes. Our other friend, who had the Linguine Pescatore, was pleasantly surprised by the generous portions of fresh seafood - shrimp, clams, and mussels - tossed with perfectly al dente pasta in a light tomato sauce. The dish was packed with flavor, making it an instant favorite among our group. During our meal, the service was impeccable; Emily consistently checked in to ensure our needs were met and offered valuable recommendations for dessert. We appreciated her warm and friendly demeanor, which made our dining experience truly delightful. Speaking of dessert, we eventually ordered the decadent Chocolate Lava Cake and the tangy Lemon Berry Mascarpone Cake to share. Each dessert was a symphony of flavors that perfectly capped off a fantastic meal. Rarely have I enjoyed a dining experience as much as I did at this establishment.

Much of their treatment , including kidnapping and slavery , As a strong opponent of Racism , the West had a duty to act , given that the conflict was against those of darker skin .","completion":"The debate topic these sentences are discussing is the racial and ethnic aspects of the conflict in Darfur, Sudan, and the moral obligation for Western countries to intervene due to these racial dimensions. The conflict in Darfur, which began in 2003, is a human rights crisis that has garnered international attention due to the extensive violence, displacement, and suffering experienced by the people of the region. The root of the crisis lies in the power struggle between armed rebel groups (comprised primarily of non-Arab ethnic groups) and government forces and government-backed Arab militias known as the Janjaweed. As mentioned in the sentences, the conflict has taken on racial overtones, with the Arab-dominated government and its allied forces often targeting black African Darfuris. The second sentence highlights the racial distinction between the people of Darfur, who are primarily black Africans, and the government forces, who are of Arab descent. Consequently, the conflict has often been described as a racially charged issue, with the Arab government and militia groups targeting black African locals. The third sentence addresses some of the human rights abuses that have occurred in the conflict, including kidnapping and slavery. These atrocities are considered manifestations of racism and ethnic persecution. In light of the racial aspect of the conflict, a strong argument can be made that Western nations, with their historical commitment to condemning racism and promoting human rights, have an ethical responsibility to intervene in the Darfur crisis. The debate on this topic revolves around whether the Western world, particularly nations like the United States and countries in the European Union, should take a more proactive role in resolving the conflict in Darfur. While some argue that direct intervention is necessary to save lives and stop the violence, others contend that it is not the responsibility of Western nations to resolve conflicts in other parts of the world, particularly when there are political, economic, and cultural complexities involved. Additionally, opponents of intervention may argue that Western nations should focus on their own domestic issues related to racism and inequality before intervening in foreign conflicts. Ultimately, the debate on this topic centers on the ethical and political implications of Western intervention in the Darfur conflict, which is characterized by strong racial and ethnic aspects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which river's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea? The Danube and Volga rivers both form large deltas, but the Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year. Hint: River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or reservoir, (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope). The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Danube river's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea, as it has a larger delta and grows faster every year compared to the Volga river. This suggests the Danube river carries more sediment and deposits it more quickly, forming a larger delta."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Going about his day, Toddy, a performer at Chez Lui in Paris, sees Labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, Victoria Grant (Julie Andrews). After the audition, Labisse drily writes her off, and she responds by sustaining a pitch to shatter his wine glass using resonant frequency. That night, Richard comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome and Toddy incites a brawl by insulting Richard and the women in his group. Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, he spots Victoria dining at a restaurant, and she invites him to join her. As neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying their check, but it escapes and the whole place breaks out in havoc. The duo run out through the rain to Toddy's, and he invites her to stay when she finds that the rain has shrunk her cheap clothes. The next morning Richard shows up to collect his things. Victoria, who is wearing his clothes, hides in Toddy's closet. When she thinks that Richard might harm Toddy, she ambushes Richard and literally kicks him out. Witnessing this, Toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing Victoria off as a man (the illusion convinced Richard who stumbles downstairs to his friends waiting in the car claiming a strange man wearing his clothes hit him) and presenting her to Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davies), the most successful agent in Paris, as a female impersonator.

It has all the songs from the standard edition plus two more songs and the music videos for \\"Chiquilla\\", \\"Parece Que Va a Llover\\", and \\"Speedy Gonzales\\". - Los Kumbia All Starz are a Mexican-American cumbia group from Corpus Christi, Texas, created by A.B. Quintanilla. Kumbia All Starz are not to be confused with Los Kumbia Kings although some members are originally from Los Kumbia Kings. Their 2006 debut album \\"Ayer Fue Kumbia Kings, Hoy Es Kumbia All Starz\\" reached number one on United States Billboard's Latin Pop Albums chart, number one on the Top Latin Albums chart, and number sixty-eight on the United States \\"Billboard\\" 200.

It began as a courtship dance practiced among the African population on the Caribbean coasts of Colombia and Panama. It later mixed with Amerindian and European instruments, steps and musical characteristics and spread throughout Latin America and abroad. While other genres of Latin American music have remained associated with specific countries or regions, cumbia has grown to be one of the most widespread and unifying musical genres to emerge from Latin America. - \`\` Rica y Apretadita '' is a song by Panamanian reggae singer El General featuring Anayca . The song was released in 1995 and is one of El General 's signature songs . \`\` Rica y Apretadita '' was later cover by Mexican - American cumbia group A.B. Quintanilla y Los Kumbia All Starz featuring Mexican - American singer Melissa Jiménez . It was released on May 20 , 2008 as the second single from their second studio album Planeta Kumbia ( 2008 ) . Ricky Rick and Melissa Jiménez provide the vocals . - Edgardo Armando Franco, better known as El General, is a Panamanian reggae artist considered by some to be one of the fathers of \\"Reggae En Español\\". During the early 1990s, he initiated the Spanish spoken dancehall. Early examples of this were the international and somewhat mainstream songs, Te Ves Buena and Tu Pun Pun. Both songs, performed in Spanish rap, were very successful in North America. After getting his foot in the door of the commercial market, many other Spanish rappers became famous in the mainstream as well, such as Vico C and DJ Negro. He has a unique, easy to listen to style of dance music and has produced many well-known songs all over Latin America. His musical works have become popular in Latin America over the last few years. This style is called Reggae en Español, because he makes dancehall reggae music with Spanish-language lyrics. - Los Kumbia Kings was an American Mexican cumbia group from Corpus Christi, Texas, created by A.B. Quintanilla and Cruz Martinez. Their music encompasses the styles of cumbia (hence their name), hip hop, and R&B. They produce songs in both Spanish and English. The band's producers from the beginning have been Quintanilla and Cruz Martínez. Quintanilla is the brother of the late \\"Queen of Tejano\\", Selena. Quintanilla played bass guitar for the group, while Martínez, husband of international artist Alicia Villarreal, played keyboards. Both co-wrote songs for the Kumbia Kings. Though the group has gone through a revolving door of members in recent years amid controversy and finger-pointing, and the Kumbia Kings of today are vastly different from what originated in Corpus Christi over eight years ago, Quintanilla and Martínez were always the soul of the group. Gone are original members Frankie J and DJ Kane, both of whom have gone on to significant success as solo artists, as well as the group K1 (Kingz One), a collaboration of founding members of Kumbia Kings who have defected from the group for reason of \\"internal dissension\\". Quintanilla, Irvin \\"Pee Wee\\" Salinas, as well as Selena's widower Chris Pérez, also decided to leave the group due to that same \\"internal dissension\\". Martínez kept Los Kumbia Kings but changed the name to Los Super Reyes for legal issues. In October 2009, Quintanilla and Martínez solved their differences, and announced that the Kumbia Kings would reunite for a series of concerts lasting from late 2009 through early 2010. - Dancehall is a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s. Initially dancehall was a more sparse version of reggae than the roots style, which had dominated much of the 1970s. Two of the biggest stars of the early dancehall era were Yellowman and Eek-a-Mouse. Dancehall brought a new generation of producers, including Linval Thompson, Gussie Clarke and Jah Thomas. In the mid-1980s, digital instrumentation became more prevalent, changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall (or \\"ragga\\") becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms. (The word \\"bashment\\", a term originating in the 1990s, was used to describe a particularly good dance; for example \\"to go to a bashment dance\\". In the Dancehall vernacular, \\"bashment\\" is therefore an adjective instead of a noun.) - Reggae en Español (in English, Spanish Reggae) is reggae and dancehall music recorded in the Spanish language by artists of Latin American origin. It originated in the mid-1970s in Panama. \\"Reggae en Español\\" goes by several names: In Panama it is called \\"La Plena\\". - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. - Latin Pop Airplay (also referred to as Latin Pop Songs) is a record chart published on \\"Billboard\\" magazine. It features Latin music information from pop music usually in Spanish. It was established by the magazine on October 8, 1994 with Mañana by Cristian Castro being the first song to reach number-one. This chart features only singles or tracks and like most \\"Billboard\\" charts, is based on airplay; the radio charts are compiled using information tracked by from Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems (BDS), which electronically monitors radio stations in more than 140 markets across the United States. The audience charts cross-reference BDS data with listener information compiled by the Arbitron ratings system to determine the approximate number of audience impressions made for plays in each daypart.

Summarize this article: The US, Britain and others said Australia should stop turning back migrant boats and using offshore detention centres. The UN Human Rights Council conducts a review of every country's human rights record once every four years. The criticism comes amid after the death of an asylum seeker who tried to escape. Australia asylum: Why is it controversial? More than 100 country representatives were critical of Australia's policies during the review including Sweden, Norway, Canada, Fiji, France, Germany and Switzerland. \\"We remain concerned about Australia's protection of the rights of migrants, especially of women and children at offshore facilities,\\" Turkey's delegate told the review, according to media reports. Australian officials, who were given opportunities to respond, argued that the country's controversial polices save lives by discouraging dangerous ocean voyages, and allow it to resettle more refugees. \\"The ensuring substantial and sustained reduction in maritime ventures as a result of Australia's managed approach to migration has resulted in Australia being able to resettle more refugees for our humanitarian programs,\\" said Steve McGlynn, according to the ABC. Australia began turning around migrant boats trying to reach its shores after the election of the current Liberal-National coalition government in 2013. Intercepted asylum seekers are sent to Christmas Island - an Australian territory in the Indian ocean, as well as Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and Nauru in the South Pacific. Iran and North Korea also reportedly voiced concern, according to Australia's Fairfax Media. Iran expressed its \\"deep concern about the mandatory immigration detention regime\\", according to the report. Sweden's delegate told the UN session Australia was the only country that used offshore processing and mandatory detention of irregular immigrants, according to ABC. Recently Australia announced a bid for a seat on the Human Rights Council for a three-year term starting in 2018. Domestically, asylum is a hot political issue. Polls have shown that a significant number of Australians approve of taking a tougher stance. The two biggest rival political groupings adopted tough policies ahead of the September 2013 polls. The Liberal-National coalition, which won, had campaigned in part on a \\"stop the boats\\" platform. The government says the journey the asylum seekers make is dangerous and controlled by criminal gangs, and they have a duty to stop it. However, critics say opposition to asylum is often racially motivated and is damaging Australia's reputation. Australia granted close to 13,800 refugee visas between 2013 and 2014. It granted about 20,000 visas between 2012 and 2013.","completion":"The US, UK and other countries have asked Australia to stop turning back migrant boats and not use offshore detention centres.

Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

Input: Paragraph- Sent 1: Johnnie had a set of small volumes of English verse, extensively annotated by his own hand, which Stoddard had brought to her early in their acquaintance, leaving it with her more as a gift than as a loan. Sent 2: She kept these little books after all the others had gone back. Sent 3: She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts. Sent 4: It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it.

Jim's land is not very fertile because it has clay soil with a high pH, while Bob's land has very fertile soil and has a good productivity on it. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of the two pieces of land has a high filtration capacity? Hint: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline. A:","completion":"Given the information provided, Jim's land has clay soil with a high pH, which indicates it is an alkali or alkaline soil. As mentioned, alkali soils have poor soil structure and low infiltration capacity due to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate that causes the soil to swell and become difficult to settle. On the other hand, Bob's land has very fertile soil and good productivity. Although the exact composition of Bob's soil is not provided, it is clear that it is not clay soil with a high pH like Jim's land.

He is delighted to at last get a good job hanging up posters, but on the sole condition that he has a bicycle which must be used for work. He is told unequivocally: \\"No bicycle, no job.\\" His wife Maria pawns their bedsheets in order to get money to redeem his bicycle from the pawnbroker.Early on in the film, Ricci's coveted bicycle is stolen by a bold young thief who snatches it when he is hanging up a poster.Antonio thinks that the police will take the theft very seriously, but they are not really interested in the petty theft of a bike. The only option is for Antonio and his friends to walk the streets of Rome themselves, looking for the bicycle. After trying for hours with no luck, they finally give up and leave.Desperate for leads and with his better judgement clouded, Antonio even visits the dubious backstreet fortune teller that he had earlier mocked, in the hope that she may be able to shed light upon the bike's whereabouts. However, she merely doles out to him one of the truisms that form her stock in trade: \\"you'll find the bike quickly, or not at all.\\" Feeling cheated, a crestfallen Antonio hands over to her some of the last money that they have.

Write a title for this article: The Obama administration responded Sunday to the prison release of a Mexican drug lord who was serving 40 years for the 1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena. “We are deeply concerned by the release of Rafael Caro Quintero from prison in Mexico,” said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. “We remain as committed today in seeing Quintero and others involved in this crime face justice in the United States as we were in the immediate aftermath of Kiki Camarena's murder and will work closely with the Mexican authorities on this.” The statement follows a lawyer for Mexican drug traffickers Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, also imprisoned in the Camarena case, saying his legal team had filed an appeal based on the same procedural grounds used by Caro Quintero and that he expects his client to be freed within 15 days by a different court. Caro Quintero was released Friday by a Mexican court that overturned the conviction, saying he had been improperly tried in a federal court for state crimes. The Justice Department said it found the court's decision \\"deeply troubling.\\" \\"The Department of Justice, and especially the Drug Enforcement Administration, is extremely disappointed with this result,\\" the agency said in a statement. The Justice Department also said it \\"has continued to make clear to Mexican authorities the continued interest of the United States in securing Caro Quintero's extradition so that he might face justice in the United States.\\" The DEA said separately it \\"will vigorously continue its efforts to ensure Caro Quintero faces charges in the United States for the crimes he committed.\\" Caro Quintero still faces charges in the United States. The Mexican government said Friday it was reviewing what legal moves it might take in the case, according to The Wall Street Journal. The country’s attorney general's office said in a statement it disagrees with the immediate liberation and the court should have handed over the case to the proper court for review. The office also said Caro Quintero’s charges were too serious to free him without exhausting all legal channels. In recent years, Mexico has stepped up extraditions of alleged drug kingpins to the U.S., usually after they have served some prison time in Mexico, according to The Journal. The whereabouts of the 61-year-old Quintero is unclear, after serving 20 years and walking out of prison. The Association of Former Federal Narcotics Agents in the United States said it was \\"outraged\\" by Caro Quintero's early release and blamed corruption within Mexico's justice system. \\"The release of this violent butcher is but another example of how good faith efforts by the U.S. to work with the Mexican government can be frustrated by those powerful dark forces that work in the shadows of the Mexican 'justice' system,\\" the organization said in a statement. Mexican authorities did not release the full decision explaining the reasoning of the three-judge panel, in the western state of Jalisco, in setting free Caro Quintero. But some experts said the ruling may have been part of a broader push to rebalance the Mexican legal system in favor of defendants' rights, from both law-enforcement officials and the independent judicial system. Mexico's Supreme Court has issued several recent rulings overturning cases while saying due process wasn't followed. However, Mexican and current and former U.S. officials alike expressed deep skepticism that correct procedures were followed in the decision to free Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero was a founding member of one of Mexico's earliest and biggest drug cartels. He helped establish a powerful cartel based in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa that later split into some of Mexico's largest cartels, including the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels. But he wasn't tried for drug trafficking, a federal crime in Mexico. Instead, Mexican federal prosecutors, under intense pressure from the United States, put together a case against him for Camarena's kidnapping and killing, both state crimes. Mexican courts and prosecutors have long tolerated illicit evidence such as forced confessions and have frequently based cases on questionable testimony or hearsay. Such practices have been banned by recent judicial reforms, but past cases, including those against high-level drug traffickers, are often rife with such legal violations. Mexico's relations with Washington were badly damaged when Caro Quintero ordered Camarena kidnapped, tortured and killed, purportedly because he was angry about a raid on a 220-acre (89-hectare) marijuana plantation in central Mexico named \\"Rancho Bufalo\\" -- Buffalo Ranch -- that was seized by Mexican authorities at Camarena's insistence. Camarena was kidnapped in Guadalajara, a major drug trafficking center at the time. His body and that of his Mexican pilot, both showing signs of torture, were found a month later, buried in shallow graves. Caro Quintero was eventually hunted down in Costa Rica. The Associated Press contributed to this report.","completion":"\\"U.S. Outcry Over Release of Mexican Drug Lord Involved in DEA Agent's Murder: The Controversial Case of Rafael Caro Quintero\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- One day after Syrian rebels accused government forces of a deadly bombing near a hospital in the besieged city of Aleppo, opposition groups said another 151 people had been killed in the fighting Thursday. The majority of those deaths occurred in the Syrian capital of Damascus and its suburbs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group. Another 34 were killed in Aleppo, where some of the heaviest fighting has occurred. The 20-month civil war has claimed more than 42,000 lives, according to the latest tally from the opposition Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria. The group counts 3,133 government soldiers among the dead. A letter to","completion":"the United Nations from the Syrian National Coalition, the main opposition group, called for an immediate investigation into the hospital bombing and urged the international community to take a stronger stance on the ongoing violence in the country. Amid growing concern over the mounting death toll and the deteriorating humanitarian situation, the UN Security Council convened an emergency session to discuss the escalating crisis. During the session, several member nations expressed their alarm at the continued bloodshed and urged for a united effort to address the situation. Despite the calls for action, the Council remained divided on the best course of action, with Russia and China backing the Syrian government and the United States, the European Union, and regional powers supporting the opposition forces. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sternly condemned the hospital bombing and called upon all parties involved in the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and protect civilians. As the crisis worsened, the UN continued to push for a political solution to the conflict, amid growing fears that the violence could spill over into neighboring countries and further destabilize the region. Several international humanitarian organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières, stepped up their efforts to bring much-needed aid to those affected by the conflict, particularly to those displaced internally and refugees who sought shelter in neighboring countries. Despite the international response to the crisis, the violence in Syria continued unabated, as both government forces and opposition groups engaged in fierce battles for control over key territories. The relentless fighting deepened the suffering of ordinary Syrians and raised further questions over the future of the nation. As the conflict entered its third year, the persistence and intensity of the fighting spurred additional attempts by world leaders to broker a peace deal. Ultimately, diplomatic efforts, along with mounting pressure from the international community, led to the initiation of negotiations between the Syrian government and opposition forces. Under the auspices of the United Nations, representatives from both sides of the conflict came together for several rounds of talks in the Swiss city of Geneva. After months of intense negotiations, the parties finally reached a comprehensive peace agreement centered on a power-sharing deal and a roadmap for future democratic reforms in Syria. In the following months, the peace deal was implemented, as the warring factions agreed to a ceasefire, and a transitional government was formed with representatives from both the Syrian government and the opposition. The international community, led by the United Nations, played a crucial role in overseeing the transitional period, ensuring the implementation of agreed-upon initiatives, monitoring the ceasefire, and providing much-needed humanitarian assistance. The establishment of the transitional government marked the beginning of a long and arduous process of rebuilding the war-torn nation. With millions displaced and a devastated infrastructure, the challenges of reconstruction loomed large. However, the Syrian people's resilience, and the sense of solidarity and resolve from the international community, gave hope for a brighter future for a peaceful and united Syria."},{"prompt":"Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy in 1916 and continued there until his death? , can you please find it? Carl August Nielsen (Danish: [kɑːl ˈnelsn̩]; 9 June 1865 – 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer. Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his Op. 1, Suite for Strings, in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen, during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death. Although his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his \\"psychological\\" period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen. Nielsen is especially noted for his six symphonies, his Wind Quintet and his concertos for violin, flute and clarinet. In Denmark, his opera Maskarade and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as Brahms and Grieg, but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with progressive tonality and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen's sixth and final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, was written in 1924–25. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in Vestre Cemetery, Copenhagen. Nielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the...

Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Background Paragraph: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi. The tuatara has a well-developed parietal eye on its forehead.Lizards have skulls with only one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.Snakes are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the Cretaceous period, and they share many of the same features. The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs. The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole. Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent \\"spectacle\\" scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Story: An archipelago in the Indian ocean included two very different islands. Snake island was a reptile paradise, inhabited by many species of reptiles. Bird island had few reptiles on it, but had various birds inhabiting it. Question: Which island was inhabited by fewer snakes?","completion":"Answer: Bird island"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While recuperating, May was initially absent when the band started work on their third album, but he returned midway through the recording process. Released in 1974, Sheer Heart Attack reached number two in the United Kingdom, sold well throughout Europe, and went gold in the United States. It gave the band their first real experience of international success, and was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. The album experimented with a variety of musical genres, including British music hall, heavy metal, ballads, ragtime, and Caribbean. At this point, Queen started to move away from the progressive tendencies of their first two releases into a more radio-friendly, song-orientated style. Sheer Heart Attack introduced new sound and melody patterns that would be refined on their next album, A Night at the Opera.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What may happen next in speaker 's story ?","completion":"In the speaker's story, after Samantha, their best friend, moves to Tampa, there may be a few possible developments. Here's a detailed and long description of some potential scenarios that may happen next: 1. Strengthened friendship with Samantha: With Samantha relocating to Tampa, the speaker might take this opportunity to spend more time with her, fostering a deeper bond between them. They might make an effort to visit each other regularly, share new experiences together, and support each other as they navigate their lives in a new location. 2. Assisting Samantha with the move: The speaker may assist Samantha in her moving process by providing emotional support, helping her find a new home, and aiding with the logistics of the move. This assistance might involve packing, organizing, and offering suggestions for a smooth transition to Tampa. The speaker's involvement in this process may further deepen their friendship and create lasting memories. 3. Reflecting on their hometown: With their best friend leaving and their strong negative sentiments toward their hometown, the speaker might contemplate their own future in this location. They may weigh the pros and cons of staying or moving, perhaps even considering joining Samantha in Tampa or relocating elsewhere. This process of reflection may lead to significant life changes and personal growth for the speaker. 4. Supporting others in relocation: Inspired by Samantha's move and their own desire to help the people they care about, the speaker might extend support to others in their community by providing resources, advice, and encouragement to explore new horizons. They may become an advocate for change and improvement in their hometown or even start an organization designed to help people who are unhappy with their current situation. 5. Acceptance and reconciliation: While the speaker's initial reaction to their hometown's decline is rooted in anger and frustration, they may eventually come to accept the situation and work towards finding a sense of peace. This might involve actively participating in local initiatives to improve the community or merely accepting that they cannot control everything. This acceptance could lead to a more balanced and harmonious perspective on life. These are just a few potential scenarios that may unfold in the speaker's story following Samantha's move to Tampa. Regardless of the path chosen, the speaker's deep care for their best friend and desire for change may lead them down a journey of self-discovery, growth, and the strengthening of bonds in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat.

Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer.

Murray Newton Rothbard (; March 2, 1926 - January 7, 1995) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School, a historian, and a political theorist whose writings and personal influence played a seminal role in the development of modern right-libertarianism. Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism, a staunch advocate of historical revisionism, and a central figure in the twentieth-century American libertarian movement. In 1953, in New York City, he married JoAnn Schumacher (1928-1999), whom he called Joey. JoAnn was his editor and a close adviser, as well as hostess of his \\"Rothbard Salon\\". They enjoyed a loving marriage, and Rothbard often called her \\"the indispensable framework\\" behind his life and achievements. According to Joey, patronage from the Volker Fund allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first fifteen years of their marriage. The Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment from various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to the engineering students of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966, at age 40. This institution had no economics department or economics majors, and Rothbard derided its social science department as \\"Marxist.\\" However, Justin Raimondo writes that Rothbard liked his role with Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics. Rothbard continued in this role for twenty years, until 1986. Then 60 years old, Rothbard left Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute for the Lee Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he held the title of S.J. Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics, an endowed chair paid for by a libertarian businessman. According to Rothbard's friend, colleague and fellow Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Rothbard led a \\"fringe existence\\" in academia, but was able to attract a large number of \\"students and disciples\\" through his writings, thereby becoming \\"the creator and one of the principal agents of the contemporary libertarian movement.\\" Rothbard maintained his position at UNLV from 1986 until his death. Rothbard founded the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1976 and the Journal of Libertarian Studies in 1977. In 1982, he co-founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, and was vice president of academic affairs until 1995. The Institute's Review of Austrian Economics, a heterodox economics journal later renamed the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, was also founded by Rothbard in 1987. After Rothbard's death, Joey reflected on Rothbard's happiness and bright spirit. \\"...he managed to make a living for 40 years without having to get up before noon. This was important to him.\\" She recalled how Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague Llewellyn Rockwell. \\"Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment, as they checked in with each other. Murray thought it was the best possible way to start a day.\\" Rothbard was irreligious and agnostic toward the existence of God, describing himself as a \\"mixture of an agnostic and a Reform Jew.\\" Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, Rothbard was critical of the \\"left-libertarian hostility to religion\\". In Rothbard's later years, many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism, but he never did.

It's just a word, but for millions of Americans it brings much more than a word. Hot dogs. Cold beers. Sunny afternoons. Baseball is the game of fathers and sons. Fathers and sons catch with each other on lawns in the US. A father's favorite team becomes his son's. Grandfathers talk to their grandsons about games played long ago. Many American kids collect baseball cards. The cards have pictures of their favorite players on them. In school, friends trade baseball cards just like they trade their lunches. Players are known as \\"the boys of summer\\" because people often play the sport mostly in warm months. You don't need to be of a certain size or shape to play baseball. You don't have to be tall like a basketball player or strong like an American footballer. You just need to want to have fun. Baseball is not as fast-paced a game as basketball.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the individual whose holdings included a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres of meadow and 330 acres of marsh? is inside the article: The Sleaford area has been inhabited since the late Iron Age; people settled around the ford where a prehistoric track running northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea. A large hoard of coin moulds belonging to the Corieltauvi tribe have been uncovered in this area and dated to the late Iron Age. It was occupied by the Romans, and then by the Anglo-Saxons. The place-name Slioford first appears in 852, meaning \\"crossing over a muddy stream\\", in reference to the Slea. The settlement around the crossing came to be known as \\"Old\\" Sleaford in 13th-century sources to distinguish it from developments further west, around the present-day market place, which came to be known as \\"New\\" Sleaford. The origins of New Sleaford are not clear, leading to a theory that it was planted by the Bishop of Lincoln in the 12th century as a means of increasing his income, hence the epithet \\"New\\". The town's compass-point layout, the 12th-century date of St Denys' stonework and other topographical features offer evidence for this theory.A speculative reassessment of Domesday Book (1086) material suggests that St Denys' origins may be earlier. Two manors called Eslaforde (Sleaford) were recorded in the Domesday Book, one held by Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln, the other by Ramsey Abbey. The Bishop succeeded a Saxon thegn, Bardi, and held 11 carucates with 29 villeins, 11 bordars, 6 sokemen, a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres (130 ha) of meadow and 330 acres (130 ha) of marsh. Ramsey Abbey had been granted land in Sleaford and surrounding villages before the Norman Conquest of England; in Domesday its fee consisted of 1 carucate, 1 sokeman, 2 villeins and 27 acres of meadow. It was sokeland of the abbot of Ramsey's manor of Quarrington, where he held two churches. There is no evidence for a second church at Quarrington, which suggests that the record is alluding to one in another of the abbot's manors for which Quarrington was an estate centre. The local historians David Roffe and Christine Mahany..., can you guess it ? The answer is:","completion":"Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln.

The process may seem intimidating, but with this step-by-step guide, you will master the art of preparing a perfectly stuffed pork tenderloin in no time. So, let's get started on this scrumptious journey. Step 1: Prepare the Pork Tenderloin Place the pork tenderloin on a clean, stable cutting board. Ensure that the pork is fresh and of high quality for the best results. Prepare your knife by sharpening it for an accurate and smooth cut. Step 2: Butterfly the Pork Tenderloin With a sharp knife, make a vertical cut down the length of the pork tenderloin, keeping the knife blade parallel to the cutting board. Stop the cut about 1 inch from the end of the tenderloin. The idea here is not to cut completely through the meat but to leave enough intact so that it can be opened up and laid flat like a book. Step 3: Flatten the Butterflied Pork After you've butterflied the pork tenderloin, open it up and lay it flat on the cutting board. Use a meat mallet or a rolling pin to pound the meat gently and uniformly, aiming for an even thickness throughout. This step ensures that the pork tenderloin will cook evenly and allows for more space for the stuffing. Step 4: Chill the Meat Once you have achieved the desired thickness, wrap the flattened pork tenderloin in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes. Chilling the meat while you prepare the stuffing will help retain its shape and texture, ensuring a delicious outcome. Step 5: Prepare Your Favorite Stuffing While the pork tenderloin is chilling, prepare your stuffing. You can choose any stuffing that you like, such as a classic mix of breadcrumbs, herbs, and spices, or a combination of vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Just make sure your stuffing complements the flavor of the pork. Step 6: Stuff and Roll the Pork Tenderloin Remove the chilled tenderloin from the refrigerator and unwrap it. Place your prepared stuffing onto the flattened meat, spreading it evenly across the surface. Carefully roll up the tenderloin, encasing the stuffing, and ensuring that the stuffing stays inside the meat. Step 7: Tie the Stuffed Pork Tenderloin Once rolled up, use butcher's twine to securely tie the stuffed pork tenderloin. The ties should be spaced about an inch apart to keep the shape of the stuffed tenderloin intact and ensure even cooking. Step 8: Cook the Stuffed Pork Tenderloin Follow the cooking instructions in your chosen recipe, adjusting the cooking time based on the thickness of the meat and the type of stuffing used. Cooking methods can include roasting, grilling or even sous vide for more precise temperature control. Cook the tenderloin to an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) for safe consumption, using a meat thermometer to verify the temperature. Conclusion: Now that you have successfully stuffed, rolled, and tied your pork tenderloin, you are ready to enjoy a delicious and satisfying meal. Serve your expertly prepared stuffed pork tenderloin with sides like mashed potatoes, asparagus, or a fresh green salad for a complete dining experience that will impress your family and friends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution?","completion":"In order to solve the equation -13 = -4*q + 3 for q, you will need to isolate the variable q by using algebraic operations. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this: 1. Start with the given equation: -13 = -4*q + 3 2. Your goal is to get q alone on one side of the equation, so you want to get rid of the constant term on the right side (in this case, 3). To do this, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation. -13 - 3 = -4*q + 3 - 3 This simplifies to: -16 = -4*q 3. Now, you need to isolate q by getting rid of the coefficient in front of it (in this case, -4). To do this, divide both sides of the equation by -4. (-16) / (-4) = (-4*q) / (-4) This simplifies to: 4 = q So, the solution to the equation -13 = -4*q + 3 is q = 4."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The New York Lottery began in 1967. This information tells us the beginning of the New York Lottery, which implies it has been operating since then. 2. It is a part of the New York State Gaming Commission. This information confirms that it is an officially run lottery under the commission's umbrella. 3. It provides revenue for public education. This statement suggests that the lottery generates money, which typically comes from people participating and buying tickets. Based on this information, we can infer that people have been participating in the New York Lottery since 1967. In any game of chance such as a lottery, there are always winners and losers. The money generated from ticket sales comes from a large pool of participants, and only a few people win big prizes while the majority do not. There isn't information explicitly stating that there have been losers; however, it's reasonable to conclude that the sentence \\"The New York Lottery has had losers\\" is true because, logically, a lottery system with participants and winners will inherently have losers as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Findings Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients. Interpretation The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced. Funding None.

Despite Weiner claiming that he did not use any government resources for these affairs, stating specifically that his BlackBerry device was not government-paid, Pelosi and other Democrats, who were initially supportive of Weiner, backed the call for investigation. Among these Democrats was Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, who criticized Weiner for his actions which he described as \\"a deep personal failure and inappropriate behavior\\" that brought embarrassment to himself, his family, and the House. He, too, supported the ethics investigation in order to eliminate all doubts about the situation. Spokeswoman for House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, Katie Grant, expressed a similar sentiment, stating that the Ethics Committee should investigate any ethical issues that have been raised in the public sphere regarding Weiner's conduct. However, a GOP source described the move as \\"hollow\\", since Pelosi did not demand Weiner's resignation. This is in contrast to the case of former Rep. Chris Lee, a married Republican who resigned after a report of him attempting to meet a woman on Craigslist was published. Weiner responded to the call for an ethics investigation by stating that he will \\"welcome and will fully cooperate with the investigation by the House Ethics Committee.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: Make a locket using a shotgun shell.","completion":"Crafting a locket using a shotgun shell is a creative way to upcycle, and it can also serve as a unique piece of jewelry or keepsake. Prior to starting, please always remember that you should be careful when handling spent ammunition and should only use shotgun shells that have already been fired and are completely empty. It is always best not to try to dismantle a live or loaded shell since it's incredibly dangerous. Please ensure your own safety and engage in this project only if you are confident in doing so. What You'll Need: 1. A spent shotgun shell 2. A picture to put in the locket 3. Jewelry glue or hot glue gun 4. Craft knife 5. Plier 6. Sandpaper 7. Locket bail and jewelry chain 8. Clear resin or clear, hard-drying glue 9. Protective gloves Steps: 1. Clean the Shotgun Shell: The first step is to clean your spent shotgun shell thoroughly. Use warm soapy water and a brush to scrub off any residue. Rinse well and let the shell air dry. 2. Cut the Shotgun shell: Once the shell is dry, cut around the circumference of the shell casing using a craft knife. The cut should be just above the middle of the shell - you want to keep as much of the decorative ‘brass’ part of the shell as possible. Be very careful while doing this step. 3. Create the Locket Top: After the shell is cut, you'll have two pieces. The part with the circular, concave end will make the top of the locket. If there's any sharp edge, use sandpaper to smooth it out. 4. Create Locket Bottom: The other piece forms the bottom of the locket, where the picture will go. You'll need to remove any remaining plastic lining or metal. You can use a small pair of pliers for this. 5. Glue the Picture: Once both parts are ready, cut your desired picture to match the inside of the bottom shell piece. Glue the picture into the base of the shell using jewelry glue or a hot glue gun. Allow the glue to dry. 6. Apply Resin or Clear Glue: After the glue holding the picture dries, apply a clear resin or clear, hard-drying glue over the picture to protect it and give the locket a nice, shiny finish. Make sure you cover the whole picture. Let this dry as well but make sure it's dry completely before moving on. 7. Attach the Locket Bail: Once everything is dry, you can attach the locket bail to the top part of the shell using your jewelry glue or hot glue gun. Remember to ensure that the glue is dried properly before moving on. 8. Assemble the Locket: Now you can place the top part onto the bottom part, it should sit nicely. If you want to be able to open and close the locket, consider using a metal hinge or latch, but this would make the project more advanced. 9. Add Chain: Finally, thread a jewelry chain through the locket bail. Voila! You have made your own unique and personalized shotgun-shell locket. Always remember to respect the nature of what you're working with, and make sure you're safe at all times."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This case has reignited the debate on the infiltration of terrorists amongst the refugee population, while highlighting the persistent challenges faced by security agencies in tracking down terror links across the continent. In this article, we will examine the details of this arrest, the Paris attacks context, the ongoing security challenges faced by Europe, and the potential implications on refugee policies in the region. Arrest Details Austrian prosecutors announced that two individuals were arrested at a refugee shelter in Salzburg, on suspicion of having connections with the November 2015 Paris attacks, which left 130 people dead and hundreds more injured. The identities of the arrested individuals have yet to be revealed, pending investigations. However, it has been confirmed that they were arrested on charges of 'participating in a terrorist organization.' Authorities have remained tight-lipped about further details, since the case touches upon sensitive issues of national and international security. The Paris Attacks Context On November 13, 2015, a series of coordinated terrorist attacks were carried out in Paris by members of the extremist group, the Islamic State (ISIS). The attackers targeted multiple locations, including the Bataclan Theatre, the Stade de France, and several cafés and restaurants. In total, 130 people lost their lives, and numerous others were injured. These attacks shocked the world and prompted several European countries, including Austria, to enhance cross-border security measures and intensify efforts to identify and apprehend potential affiliates and supporters of terrorist organizations. Security Challenges in Europe Europe has been grappling with the growing threat from terrorism over the past few years, with numerous attacks having been perpetrated across the continent. The rise of extremist groups like ISIS and their sophisticated recruitment tactics pose a significant challenge to security agencies. The terror threat intensified as an unprecedented influx of refugees sought asylum in Europe, escaping conflict zones like Syria and Iraq. Amidst this chaotic situation, there have been legitimate concerns that terrorists could be masquerading as refugees, exploiting the humanitarian crisis to gain entry into European countries. The refugee crisis has tested the security apparatus of European nations, which are now confronted with a dual challenge of providing humanitarian assistance to genuine refugees while also ensuring that potential terrorists are not allowed to slip through the cracks. This requires an unprecedented level of intelligence sharing, inter-agency cooperation, and effective border controls – which comes with its own set of logistical, legal, and personnel hurdles. Implications on Refugee Policies The arrest of the suspected Paris attack affiliates in Salzburg has once again put a spotlight on the potential risks associated with hosting refugees. Across Europe, concerns over the possibility of terrorists infiltrating refugee communities have already prompted a number of countries to tighten their asylum policies, adopt stricter vetting processes, and even close their borders. This latest development is likely to fuel further debate and may push some countries to adopt more conservative immigration policies. However, it is essential that measures to counter terrorism do not infringe upon the rights of genuine refugees, who are themselves victims of the same forces of extremism and violence that the international community seeks to combat. Policymakers must walk a fine line between ensuring security and upholding humanitarian principles, even as they confront the challenges posed by terrorism in a rapidly changing global landscape. Conclusion The arrest of two individuals in Salzburg, suspected of having links to the 2015 Paris attacks, underscores the ongoing threat of terrorism and represents a significant breakthrough for European security forces. As the situation continues to evolve, it is incumbent upon governments and security agencies across the continent to collaborate, share intelligence, and maintain comprehensive security measures – while also safeguarding the rights and welfare of legitimate refugees seeking safety and shelter in Europe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Health officials issued a waring over common energy-saving lghtbulbs after research showed some types could potentially harm the skin and may even raise the risk of cancer. A study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) found that some eco-friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that are above recognized safety limits. The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco-friendly bulbs. The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods, such as jewellery makers, and others who might have lights close to their faces, such as car mechanics. John O'Hagan, a scientist at the HPA's centre for radiation, chemical and environmental dangers, began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them. Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus, which makes people highly sensitive to light. The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation, measured 2cm from the lightbulbs, were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer. The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn, but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this, again similar to that of sunburn. The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes. People are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work until the problem is sorted out.

Answer:","completion":"In the James Bond films between 1995's \\"Goldeneye\\" and 2002's \\"Die Another Day,\\" the character of Miss Moneypenny is portrayed by the talented British actress Samantha Bond. Samantha Bond is a well-regarded stage and screen actress who was born on November 27, 1961, in London, England. She comes from an acting family, as her parents Philip Bond and Pat Sandys were both actors, and her brother Matthew Bond is a journalist. Samantha studied at the prestigious Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in Bristol, England, before embarking on her professional acting career. She has appeared in various stage productions, television shows and films throughout her career, working with esteemed organizations like the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre. In 1995, Samantha Bond was approached to take on the iconic role of Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond film series. Miss Moneypenny is the secretary to M, the head of the British Secret Service and a recurring character in the James Bond series. Moneypenny is usually present in a supporting capacity, often providing some light relief and flirting with Bond. Her first appearance in the James Bond series was in \\"Goldeneye\\" (1995), opposite Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. This film marked not only Bond's return after a six-year hiatus but also a new era for the franchise, as both the character of Bond and Miss Moneypenny were updated for a more modern sensibility. Samantha Bond's portrayal of Miss Moneypenny was notable for updating the character with a more assertive personality, and her on-screen chemistry with Pierce Brosnan added a playful yet professional dynamic between the characters. She reprised the role in the three subsequent Bond films featuring Brosnan as 007: \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" (1997), \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" (1999), and \\"Die Another Day\\" (2002). These movies were widely successful and helped reestablish the Bond franchise as a contemporary and engaging action film series. After the last film with Brosnan, \\"Die Another Day,\\" the Bond franchise was rebooted once more with Daniel Craig taking on the iconic role. As a result, characters like Miss Moneypenny were recast, and the role was eventually played by actress Naomie Harris in \\"Skyfall\\" (2012) and subsequent films. In addition to her work in the James Bond series, Samantha Bond has enjoyed continued success both on stage and in television, with roles in popular series such as \\"Downton Abbey\\" and the British comedy \\"Outnumbered.\\" She has been nominated for several awards for her acting performances and continues to work as a highly regarded actress to this day."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Gud\\" A:","completion":"It is difficult to determine a specific star rating based only on \\"Gud\\" without more context.

Please answer the following question: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Input: Passage: The 6-3 Patriots played the 6-3 Indianapolis Colts and their rookie quarterback Andrew Luck. Though both offenses were potent, the Patriots ran roughshod over the Colts. The Colts took the opening drive 80 yards in 7 plays, added by a 40-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Kyle Arrington to score on a 1-yard touchdown run by Delone Carter. The Patriots countered, racing 81 yards in 8 plays, scoring on Brady's 4-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski(his 42nd consecutive game with a touchdown pass). The Colts retook the lead on their next drive, covering 84 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 14-yard touchdown pass from Luck to T. Y. Hilton. McCourty returned the ensuing kickoff 23 yards to the Patriots 25. From there the Patriots drove all the way to the Colts 18, but Gostkowski shanked a 36-yard field goal. After forcing a Colts three-and-out, Julian Edelman ran back the punt for a 68-yard touchdown, tying the game 14-14. On the Colts ensuing drive, Aqib Talib in his first game with New England following a trade from Tampa Bay, intercepted Luck on the first play and ran it back for a 59-yard touchdown, giving the Patriots a 21-14 lead. The Colts drove down the field again on their next possession, reaching the Patriots 29 and Adam Vinatieri was good from 47 yards, making the score 21-17. After returning the kickoff 29 yards to the 25, the Patriots drove all the way to the Colts 13, but could only add a 31-yard field goal for a 24-17 lead. The Colts drove to the Patriots 40 and attempted a 58-yard field goal right before halftime, but it was no good and the score remained 24-17. The Patriots received the opening kick-off of the second half and stormed 76 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 2-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Edelman, increasing the lead to 31-17. The Colts almost caught a break when on the drive when Darius Butler forced Wes Welker to fumble, but the ball rolled out of bounds, and the Patriots retained possession. The Colts drove to the Patriots 39 on their next drive, but punted rather than risk a 57-yard field goal attempt. On the second play of their next drive, Luck was stripped-sacked by Rob Ninkovich at the Colts 24-yard line. On the very first play of the Patriots ensuing drive, Brady connected with Gronkowski for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 38-17. The Colts just couldn't catch a break. Despite driving all the way to the Patriots 23, Luck was intercepted by Alfonzo Dennard, who returned it 87 yards for a touchdown on the first play of the fourth quarter, increasing the lead to 45-17. The Colts finally responded on their next drive, racing 74 yards in a mere 5 plays, with Luck throwing a 43-yard touchdown to T. Y. Hilton to cut the score to 45-24. However, the Patriots couldn't be stopped. The Patriots raced 80 more yards against an overwhelmed Colts defensive, scoring on Ridley's 1-yard touchdown run, upping the blowout to 52-24. Aided by a 49-yard punt return by Edelman, the Patriots moved 39 yards and scored on a Vereen 4-yard touchdown run, running up the score to 59-24. Gronkowski suffered a freak arm injury on kick-protection on the PAT. The Colts stormed to the Patriots 45 on their next drive, but Luck was intercepted Wilson at the Patriots 22, who it returned it 20 yards to the Patriots 42. After a Patriots punt, the Colts ran out the rest of clock. Luck completed only 27/50 for 334 yards and 2 touchdowns but 4 interceptions. Hilton was his leading receiver with 6 catches for 100 yards. Vic Ballard rushed 16 times for 72 yards. Tom Brady was excellent going 24/35 for 331 yards 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions. Gronkowski was his leading receiver with 7 catches for 137 yards and 2 touchdowns. Edelman, Vereen, and Ridley combined for 115 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. The win put the Patriots at 7-3 and dropped the Colts to 6-4. Output:","completion":"1. Task: Create questions from the passage that involve complex reasoning, including numerical reasoning.

Daoud Abdel Sayed (Arabic: داود عبد السيد‎ ‎ ] ) is an Egyptian director and screenwriter. He was born in Cairo in 1946. He started as the assistant of Youssef Chahine in The Land. He made several critically acclaimed films, and won several international awards notably for \\"The Land of Fear\\" which was produced in 1999. Can we draw the following conclusion? Daoud Abdel Sayed is a very wealthy man","completion":"While it is known that Daoud Abdel Sayed is a successful and renowned director and screenwriter, the provided information does not give a concrete basis to conclusively determine that he is a very wealthy man. Wealth does not necessarily equal success in a creative field such as film. Many factors contribute to an individual's wealth within the film industry including salary, residuals, and the financial success of their films. Award wins, critical acclaim, and fame can definitely contribute to a person's earning potential, but these factors alone do not guarantee wealth. Additionally, wealth can be subjective and dependent on costs of living, personal expenditures, investments, and numerous other factors. Therefore, it is not always accurate to equate career success and wealth, especially with limited fiscal information. Furthermore, Sayed's wealthiness could also depend on the financial compensation structures within the Egyptian cinema industry. In some cases, directors may earn more from successful international sales, licensing agreements, or syndication deals rather than an initial salary. While Daoud Abdel Sayed's acclaimed career, and the resulting prestige and awards, suggest he might possibly have substantial earnings from his work, it's also possible he may have reinvested this capital into furthering his filmmaking or contributed it towards other ventures. It's important to remember that many successful people in the arts dedicate their earnings back into their passion projects, which might not always lead to personal wealth accumulation. Therefore, financial wealth may not necessarily be an accurate measure of their success. In cases such as these, career satisfaction, artistic expression, and crucial contributions to the art form can be seen as rewards in their own right. Hence, while it would not be unfeasible to imagine Daoud Abdel Sayed has earned a considerable income from his successful career, it is not possible to definitively conclude he is a very wealthy man based solely on this information. To come to a solid conclusion about Sayed's wealth, we would need more information about his personal finances, revenue from his films, and other potential income sources, which isn't provided here."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Don't worry, I'll break it down into simple steps, so it's easy for you to follow along. Let's start by going through the steps we'll take together to make this tasty bean feast! 1. Gather your supplies and ingredients. Before we start cooking, let's make sure we have everything we need. Ask a grown-up to help you collect the supplies and ingredients. You will need: - A pot (for cooking the beans) - A skillet or frying pan (for the yummy toppings) - Measuring cups and spoons - A large colander (to clean the beans) - A chopping board - A knife (with the help of a grown-up) - Tongs or a big spoon (for mixing everything together) Ingredients: - Beans (any kind you like!) - Water - Cumin seeds - Onion - Garlic - Ginger - Tomatoes - Chili powder (just a tiny bit for a little kick) - Turmeric - Garam masala (a warm and yummy spice mix) - Salt 2. Soak the beans. The first step to make our bean dish is to get them ready for cooking. With a grown-up's help, rinse the beans in the colander under running water. Then, let the beans take a little nap in a big bowl of water; they should be covered completely. They will soak up the water and become soft and friendly. Let them rest for a whole night or at least a few hours. 3. Cook the beans. After the beans are well-rested, they're ready to cook! Put them in a large pot with fresh water, and ask a grown-up to help you turn the heat on. When the water starts bubbling like a happy little fountain, lower the heat and let the beans cook until they are soft. Depending on the beans you use, this might take a while, so be patient! 4. Toast the cumin. While the beans are cooking, we can work on the toppings that will make our bean dish even yummier! Ask a grown-up to help you heat a skillet or frying pan. Then, gently spread the cumin seeds in the pan and let them dance around until they smell fragrant and delicious. 5. Sauté the onion, garlic, and ginger. Our cumin seeds are ready, so it's time to add more friends to the pan! With the help of a grown-up, chop the onion, garlic, and ginger into small pieces. Then, add them to the dancing cumin seeds and sauté (a fancy word for frying) them until they're golden brown and happy. 6. Add the tomatoes, chili powder, and turmeric. Now, chop the tomatoes into small pieces and add them to the party! Sprinkle in a tiny pinch of chili powder (just enough to make it a little spicy) and turmeric. Mix everything happily together and let it cook until the tomatoes become soft and juicy. 7. Add the beans to the sauté mixture. Our beans are cooked and ready to join the fun! Ask a grown-up to help you carefully add them to the pan with all the other ingredients. Stir everything together so that the beans make friends with all the yummy spices and veggies. 8. Season with garam masala and salt. Finally, sprinkle some garam masala and salt over our beautiful bean dish. Garam masala is a mix of warm spices that makes everything taste magical! Mix everything one more time, and voilà! Our delicious bean dish is ready to be enjoyed with family and friends. Congratulations, little buddy! You helped make a wonderful and healthy bean dish!

This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight.

Write a \\"ii.\\" movie review (pick from the following. i. negative; ii. positive;).","completion":"ii. Positive Movie Review: The Shawshank Redemption Title: The Shawshank Redemption – A Timeless Masterpiece of Hope and Redemption Introduction: From the moment it was released in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont and based on the novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\" by Stephen King, has captivated audiences with its powerful storytelling, memorable characters, and a heartwarming message about the resilience of the human spirit. This review will explore why The Shawshank Redemption is hailed as one of the greatest films of all time. Step 1: Focus on story and themes The story follows the life of Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), a man accused of a crime he did not commit and sentenced to serve two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. During his time in prison, Andy forges an unlikely friendship with fellow inmate Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (played by Morgan Freeman). The film focuses on themes of hope, friendship, and redemption, which are masterfully woven together to create an unforgettable narrative. Step 2: Analyze performances Tim Robbins delivers an outstanding performance as the quiet and introspective Andy Dufresne. His portrayal of a man who is determined not to let his circumstances define him is captivating. Morgan Freeman, as Red, provides the film's narration and serves as the conscience of the story. His soothing voice and charismatic screen presence bring a sense of warmth and wisdom, making his character the perfect counterpoint to Andy. Step 3: Discuss cinematography and visuals The cinematography in The Shawshank Redemption enhances the film's emotive power. The use of shadows, color contrasts, and tracking shots effectively convey the passage of time and the oppressive atmosphere of the prison. Iconic scenes, such as Andy standing in the rain after crawling through the sewer pipe to freedom, are visually stunning and leave a lasting impression. Step 4: Praise the music and soundtrack The score by Thomas Newman perfectly complements the story's emotional journey. Hauntingly beautiful piano and string melodies capture the essence of hope and melancholy that permeate the film. Additionally, the inclusion of opera in a crucial scene provides an unexpected yet poignant reminder of the transformative power of art and the human spirit. Step 5: Comment on overall impact and legacy The Shawshank Redemption has left an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of viewers around the world. Its themes of hope, perseverance, and friendship continue to resonate with audiences. The film's iconic ending, which sees Andy and Red reunite on a sun-soaked beach in Zihuatanejo, serves as a powerful testament to the enduring human spirit and the belief that even the darkest of times can give way to a brighter, more hopeful future. Conclusion: In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption stands the test of time as a cinematic masterpiece. Its captivating story, outstanding performances, stunning visuals, and soul-stirring music combine to create a film that is both emotionally resonant and deeply inspiring. The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful testament to the human spirit and an unparalleled example of the power of hope and redemption, earning its rightful place as one of the greatest films of all time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To elaborate on this statement, we can consider various factors that contributed to Steven's success in selling more art compared to Christopher. 1. Expertise: Steven, being the more superior art dealer, might have a better understanding and deeper knowledge of the pieces he is selling. This expertise allows him to communicate effectively with potential buyers, explaining the significance of the art and its value, therefore convincing them to make a purchase. 2. Network and connections: A successful art dealer often has a vast network of connections within the art community, including collectors, fellow dealers, artists, and other industry professionals. By leveraging these connections, Steven could have attracted more potential buyers to the art gallery, leading to increased sales. 3. Reputation: Steven's reputation as a prominent and respected art dealer may also have contributed to his success in selling more artwork. As collectors and buyers often seek guidance and validation from industry experts, they might prefer to work with Steven due to his standing in the community, leading to higher sales. 4. Presentation and marketing: As a superior art dealer, Steven may also possess better skills in presenting and marketing the artwork at the gallery. This includes arranging the art pieces in a visually appealing manner, providing informative catalogs and descriptions, and employing effective marketing strategies to engage potential buyers. 5. Client relationships: Another crucial aspect that may have contributed to Steven's success is the ability to build and maintain strong client relationships. As a superior art dealer, Steven likely has excellent communication skills and empathizes with the needs and preferences of his clients. His ability to tailor his sales approach according to individual clients could have played a key role in selling more art compared to Christopher. 6. Negotiation skills: In the art world, negotiation skills are critical in closing deals, especially when dealing with valuable and high-priced pieces. Steven, as a more superior art dealer, likely possesses these skills, which would have helped him sell more artwork by navigating and resolving price-related concerns effectively. In conclusion, the sentence highlights that Steven's success in selling more art than Christopher at the art gallery is attributed to his superior abilities and skills as an art dealer. This superiority manifests through a combination of expertise, connections, reputation, presentation and marketing skills, strong client relationships, and effective negotiation abilities, all of which contributed to higher art sales."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Read the bio below and try to give details on ruth millar 's: - birth name - birth date - name - birth place Bio: ruth laura millar -lrb- born in 1975 newton mearns , near glasgow , scotland -rrb- is a scottish actress , writer and producer .

(I) No; (II) Yes; Answer:","completion":"(I) No; The first canal in Panama was located at the narrowest point of the Isthmus of Panama, which connects North and South America. However, the statement \\"There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake (above sea-level)\\" is specifically a description of one of the engineering features of the current Panama Canal and is not directly related to the location of the canal itself. The Panama Canal, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, is a 50-mile long waterway that took over a decade to build, from 1904 to 1914. The idea for constructing a canal in Panama can be traced back to the early 16th century when King Charles I of Spain ordered a survey to determine the feasibility of creating a water passage through the American continent. However, it wasn't until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that serious efforts were made to build the canal due to advances in technology and engineering. The French were the first to attempt building the Panama Canal in 1881, which was led by Ferdinand de Lesseps, the same engineer responsible for the Suez Canal. The French project faced major setbacks, including the difficult terrain, tropical diseases, and engineering challenges. By 1889, the project was abandoned, and tens of thousands of workers had died. The United States later took over the project in 1904 and succeeded in completing the canal using a more effective approach. The statement you provided refers to the current engineering marvel of the Panama Canal, which includes a system of locks to overcome the differences in sea level between the two oceans and to manage the elevation change between coasts. The Gatun Lake mentioned in the statement is an artificial lake that was created as part of the canal construction process, which not only serves as a transit route for ships but also supplies water for the operation of the canal’s locks. Overall, the first canal in Panama was located at the Isthmus of Panama. While the statement about the locks and Gatun Lake is informative, it does not directly address the question about the location of the first canal."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

In Spanish, the definite article \\"los\\" is used to denote a plural noun, \\"pobres,\\" meaning \\"poor people\\" or \\"the poor.\\" 2. \\"habrían\\" (would have) - This is the conditional perfect form of the auxiliary verb \\"haber,\\" which is used to create compound tenses. In this case, the verb is conjugated for the third person plural to agree with \\"los pobres.\\" 3. \\"tenido\\" (had) - This is the past participle of the verb \\"tener\\" (to have), which when combined with the auxiliary verb \\"haber,\\" creates the compound verb tense. In this case, it is the past conditional perfect tense equivalent to \\"would have had.\\" 4. \\"miedo\\" (fear) - The noun \\"miedo\\" means \\"fear\\" in Spanish. When combined with the verb \\"tener\\" (to have), it forms the phrase \\"tener miedo\\" which means \\"to be afraid.\\" 5. \\"de\\" (of, to) - The preposition \\"de\\" is used here to establish the objective of the action (being afraid) in the sentence. 6. \\"acercarse\\" (to come near, to approach) - This is the infinitive form of the reflexive verb \\"acercarse\\" which means \\"to come near\\" or \\"to approach.\\" In this sentence, the verb remains in the infinitive form because it functions as the object of the preposition \\"de.\\" Putting all the parts together, the sentence \\"Los pobres habrían tenido miedo de acercarse\\" means \\"The poor would have been afraid to come near\\" in English."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Coming off their dominant win over the 49ers, the Broncos remained on home ground for an AFC West duel against the San Diego Chargers on Thursday Night Football. After a scoreless first quarter, a 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders gave the Broncos the lead early in the second quarter. After the two teams traded punts on their next possessions, the Chargers tied the game with a time-consuming drive, culminating with 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Philip Rivers to wide receiver Keenan Allen. On the ensuing kickoff, Chargers' linebacker Kavell Conner forced a fumble off Broncos' return specialist Andre Caldwell, and it was recovered by Chargers' tight end Ladarius Green deep in Broncos' territory. However, it was overturned after an instant replay review. The Broncos then re-claimed the lead just before halftime, with another touchdown pass from Manning to Sanders &#8212; from 31 yards out. On the Chargers' opening possession of the second half, Rivers was intercepted by Broncos' cornerback Chris Harris, Jr., and six plays later, the Broncos added to their lead, with Manning throwing his third touchdown pass to Sanders &#8212; from 3 yards out. After the Broncos' defense forced a Chargers' punt, the Broncos increased their lead to 28-7 midway through the third quarter, with running back Juwan Thompson rushing for a 2-yard touchdown. The Chargers responded on their next possession, with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to tight end Antonio Gates on 4th-and-goal. The Broncos countered early in the fourth quarter, with Thompson rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. The drive was kept alive by a defensive holding penalty on Chargers' safety Marcus Gilchrist that negated an Eric Weddle interception of Manning near the goal line. The Chargers once again had a response, with another touchdown pass from Rivers to Gates &#8212; from 10 yards out. The Broncos tried to add to their lead on their next possession, however, placekicker Brandon McManus missed on a 53-yard field goal attempt. The Chargers attempted a rally, but Rivers was intercepted by Broncos' safety Rahim Moore near the goal line with five minutes remaining in the game.

Mineral deficiency involves the diminished values of minerals. Mineral deficiency is a condition that arises when the diminished values of essential minerals in the human body fall below the necessary levels required for optimal health and well-being. Minerals are crucial elements required to carry out numerous physiological functions, such as maintaining fluid balance, forming bones and teeth, synthesizing proteins, and conducting nerve impulses. There are several factors that can contribute to mineral deficiency, including: 1. Poor dietary habits: Not consuming enough mineral-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds, can lead to a lack of essential minerals in the body. 2. Soil depletion: The depletion of essential minerals from the soil due to excessive agricultural practices can result in the reduced mineral content of the crops grown in such soil. 3. Malabsorption issues: Certain health conditions, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, or gut inflammation, can impair the body's ability to absorb minerals properly. 4. Increased mineral requirements: During certain life stages, such as pregnancy, lactation, and periods of rapid growth, the body's mineral requirements increase, resulting in a higher likelihood of deficiency if the increased needs are not met. 5. Interactions between minerals: Some minerals can compete with one another for absorption, leading to a deficiency in one if there is an excess of another. 6. Medications: Certain medications can interfere with the absorption, utilization, or excretion of minerals, resulting in a deficiency. Mineral deficiencies can manifest themselves through a variety of symptoms, depending on the specific mineral involved. For instance, a lack of calcium in the diet can lead to osteoporosis, while inadequate magnesium intake might result in muscle cramps, weakness, or insomnia. Similarly, a deficiency in iron could lead to anemia, which typically presents with fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Preventing and treating mineral deficiencies typically involve improving dietary habits to incorporate more mineral-rich foods, ensuring that the soil used for agriculture is appropriately replenished with essential minerals, addressing any underlying health issues that may be contributing to malabsorption, and consulting healthcare professionals to assess the potential impact of medications on mineral status. In some cases, supplements may be recommended to help address mineral deficiencies. However, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before beginning any supplementation regimen, as the appropriate dosage, potential interactions with other medications, and the specific form of the mineral supplement must be taken into consideration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who portrayed the leading men of his day? is inside the article: James Barton Longacre (August 11, 1794 – January 1, 1869) was an American portraitist and engraver, and the fourth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint from 1844 until his death. Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm. He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre. Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained. Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece. In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber. Longacre's coins are generally well-regarded today, although they have been criticized for lack of artistic..., can you guess it ?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, the last name of the person who portrayed the leading men of his day is Longacre.

He popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science. It is considered to be the precursor of natural science. - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (1859 ) which paved the way for evolutionary trees. - Johann Jakob Kaup ( April 10 , 1803 - July 4 , 1873 ) was a German naturalist .

He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862).

Mitchum is his usual excellent self here in Man With The Gun - not one of his very best performances, Mitchum still has his classic and effective tough-guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action-packed, meaningful, and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park.

Thomas Wesley Pentz (born November 10, 1978), better known by his stage name Diplo, is an American DJ, record producer, rapper and songwriter based in Los Angeles, California. He is the co-creator and lead member of the electronic dancehall music project Major Lazer, and along with producer and DJ Skrillex, part of the electronic duo Jack U. He founded and manages record company Mad Decent, as well as co-founding the non-profit organization Heads Decent. Among other jobs, he has worked as a school teacher in Philadelphia. Diplo's first collaborative full-length record was with Switch, this time under the guise of Major Lazer. Diplo (Philadelphia-based DJ and producer Wesley Pentz), incorporates such disparate influences as Miami Bass and Baile Funk into the high-tech eclecticism of his productions. After landing a deal with Downtown Records before even recording a note of music, Diplo and Switch set out for Jamaica to record a project that, like most of Diplo's projects before it, would highlight the little-known subgenres, this time of Jamaica's dancehall scene. The two received support by many already established Jamaican artists such as Vybz Kartel, Elephant Man and Ms. Thing, and the resulting record Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do also featured vocals from Santigold, Amanda Blank, Nina Sky, Ricky Blaze and more. When discussing the Major Lazer project, Diplo described the dancehall sound as being \\" the end of the world, all the little influences--house, soca, oldies, R&B, jazz--it all ends up in Jamaica.\\" The track \\"Pon De Floor\\" from Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do was sampled for Beyonce's single \\"Run the World (Girls)\\". Major Lazer's first album was followed up with an EP, Lazers Never Die, which was released in 2010. Switch left Major Lazer in 2011, and was replaced by DJs Jillionaire and Walshy Fire. A second album, Free the Universe, was scheduled to be released in November 2012 but was delayed to February 2013, and then to April 15. It features artists such as Ezra Koenig, Bruno Mars, Ward 21, Wyclef, The Partysquad, Shaggy, Tyga, Flux Pavilion and Wynter Gordon. On February 8, 2015, during the Grammy Award ceremony, Diplo revealed details of the third Major Lazer album. He confirmed that the album would incorporate artists such as Ariana Grande, Ellie Goulding and Pusha T. It is called Peace Is the Mission. The first single, \\"Lean On\\", is a collaboration with French producer DJ Snake and features vocals from Danish recording artist MO. The second single, \\"Powerful\\", featuring Ellie Goulding and Tarrus Riley, was released simultaneously with the album on June 1, 2015. On November 11, 2015, \\"Lean On\\" became Spotify's Most Streamed Song of All Time with over 800 million streams to date. Along with the streaming title, the official video for \\"Lean On\\" became one of the most viewed videos on YouTube. It currently has more than 2 billion views. Along with the streaming and viewing milestones, \\"Lean On\\" would also go on to achieve double platinum status. On July 22, 2016, the group released the single \\"Cold Water\\", a collaboration with Canadian artist Justin Bieber and Danish singer MO. The track has already reached over 200 million streams on Spotify, and achieved international commercial success, reaching number one in multiple countries. Their upcoming album, Music is the Weapon, is set to be released in 2016 with collaborations including Sia, The Weeknd and Ty Dolla Sign. On November 29, 2016, Major Lazer and Bad Royale released \\"My Number\\", a track that samples \\"54-46 That's My Number\\" which Pitchfork describes as, \\"a genre-defining classic from legendary ska/reggae group Toots and the Maytals.\\" This release contained newly recorded vocals from frontman Toots Hibbert specifically designed for Major Lazer, which changed the original lyrics to incorporate the group into the song while keeping the original melody.","completion":"This text is about Thomas Wesley Pentz, better known by his stage name Diplo, an American DJ, record producer, rapper, and songwriter.

What is is a Japanese collectible card game that embody's the art of applying design and aesthetics to create a game for entertainment or for educational, exercise, or experimental purposes and was published by Konami ? Answer:","completion":"The Japanese collectible card game that embodies the art of applying design and aesthetics to create a game for entertainment or for educational, exercise, or experimental purposes, and was published by Konami, is Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game (TCG). Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG was first launched in Japan in 1999, and it is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters, which is a central theme in the original Yu-Gi-Oh! manga series created by Kazuki Takahashi. The game involves players using a combination of Monster, Spell, and Trap cards to strategically defeat their opponent by reducing their Life Points to zero or causing them to run out of cards in their deck. The Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG has since gained widespread international popularity, with numerous expansions, competitive tournaments, and an animated television series dedicated to it. The game's mechanics and aesthetic design are influenced by ancient Egyptian mythology, various historical and mystical elements, as well as the concept of strategy and dueling. The artwork and lore on the cards play a significant role in the game's appeal, alongside the strategic depth and competitive nature of the gameplay."},{"prompt":"I heard that Leed turned their eyes away from the scary movie on TV.

Just when it was easy to assume that a costume drama about royalty couldn't go anywhere, we are given a treat, a moving and intelligent drama anchored by strong and charismatic performances by Emily Blunt, a marvel in the leading role, Paul Bettany, Rupert Friend, Miranda Richardson, and Mark Strong, as the immediate forces that help shape the development of one of England's most powerful monarchs. \\"The Young Victoria\\" dramatizes the tumultuous transition of the young woman into power. Emily plays the queen, with a good combination of raw strength and innocence, someone who recognizes the complexity of the task at hand, but who possesses enough confidence to move forward. She is able to portray Victoria, as an astute young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand. Victoria must fend a barrage of intrusions on her way to the crown, and even when she takes command of her new position, she discovers the road to self sufficiency will depend on making some very important decisions and of course, the right support. Luckily for Victoria, there is Albert, a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate. There is amazing chemistry between the two performers, and there's little doubt what the outcome will be, but there is the figure of Bettany's Prime Minister, a man who provides Victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her. Miranda Richardson and Mark Strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl. Every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development, but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by Blunt, an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances. In here, she is given the breakout role of her career, a real life historical figure, who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time. She shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years. She also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes. \\"The Young Victoria\\" is not a royal epic portrayal of England's ruling class. It is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them. In the end, the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction.

Q: Yes; I have a rare form of cluster/ice pick headaches that can affect any part of my body. It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function.

What would happen to the force of gravity between two soccer balls if Jim moved them farther apart it would increase or it would decrease? A:","completion":"If Jim moved the two soccer balls farther apart, the force of gravity between them would decrease. This is because the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, as described by Newton's law of universal gravitation: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 In this case, the masses of the soccer balls (m1 and m2) remain constant, but the distance between them (r) increases. As the denominator in the formula (r^2) gets larger, the overall force of gravity (F) decreases.

Here are some examples. In the United States at the moment the three most popular names for girls are Emily,Emma and Madison. For boys,they are Michael,Joshua and Mathew. In Britain a parent today might call their little girl Grace,Jessica or Ruby. If they have a little boy they could call him Jack,Thomas or Oliver. In China names have very clear meanings. If a girl is called Mei,her name means \\"beautiful\\". If a boy is called Wu,his name means \\"like a soldier\\". Names in Englishspeaking countries are like this too. The girl's name Joy is probably partly chosen because the parents wish their daughter to be joyful and bring joy to others. If a girl is called Ruby,it may be because of the beautiful red precious stone. Parents often pick names that can be shortened. This can be confusing for Chinese people. Parents might choose such names because they want to be able to speak to their kid in a personal way. For example,a popular name is William. But William can be shortened to Will,Willy,Bill and Billy. The same is true of the favourite old name for a girl,Elizabeth. Elizabeth can be shortened to Beth,Liza and Liz. Another reason why kids get the names they do is that parents want to name their boy or girl after someone who is famous,such as an actor,a pop music star or a sports star.

Write an article based on this \\"Four men from Luton have been charged under the Terrorism Act with encouraging support for the so-called Islamic State group, the Metropolitan Police has said.\\"","completion":"Title: Luton Men Charged with Encouraging Support for the Islamic State Group – A Detailed Insight Introduction Four men from Luton, a large town in Bedfordshire, England, have been charged under the Terrorism Act for allegedly encouraging support for the so-called Islamic State group (IS), as reported by the Metropolitan Police. This news highlights the ongoing threat of radicalisation and terrorism, drawing attention to the steps being taken by law enforcement agencies to counter and prevent such activities in the United Kingdom. Background on the Islamic State Group (IS) The Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, ISIL, or Daesh, is an extremist militant group that has its origins in the early 2000s. It gained worldwide notoriety in 2014 when it overran large parts of Iraq and Syria, imposing its radical interpretation of Sharia law on millions of people. At its peak, the group controlled territories spanning two countries and threatened to destabilise the entire region before losing most of its controlled territories in 2017. The group has been responsible for numerous human rights abuses, including mass executions, sexual enslavement, and the destruction of cultural heritage sites. IS has inspired or directed thousands of individuals worldwide to participate in terrorism and has claimed responsibility for attacks in European cities such as Paris, Brussels, and Manchester, among many others. The group's activities have led to international military campaigns and an ongoing focus by governments and security agencies, such as the United Kingdom's Counter Terrorism Command (CTC), to prevent, disrupt and prosecute any individual or group attempting to provide material or ideological support to the group. Charges Under the Terrorism Act The four Luton men are specifically charged with encouraging support for IS, a violation of Section 12 of the United Kingdom's Terrorism Act 2000. This section covers offences related to inviting support for a proscribed organisation, such as incitement, promotions, and recruitment activities for the organisation. Individuals found guilty of this offence may face a prison sentence of up to 14 years and potentially, an unlimited fine. Charges like these send a clear message that encouraging support for or spreading extremist ideologies will be met with severe consequences, reflecting the government's strong stance against any organisation that threatens the security and stability of the country or its international partners. Countering Radicalisation and Terrorism in the UK The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of efforts to dismantle extremist groups like the Islamic State. Various initiatives have been implemented to counter the dissemination of radical ideologies both online and offline, ultimately aiming to prevent vulnerable individuals from being recruited into terrorist organisations. One of these initiatives is the government's CONTEST strategy, which comprises four work streams: Prevent, Pursue, Protect, and Prepare. The Prevent programme specifically focuses on stopping people from supporting terrorism by providing early intervention and support to individuals who may be at risk of radicalisation. In addition to legislation against terrorism support, the government has also increased its funding for intelligence and security agencies, which are responsible for detecting and neutralising terrorist threats. This has led to arrests, disruption of extremist networks, and targeted interventions. Online platforms have also become a focus for countering radicalisation and terrorism. Social media companies and internet service providers have been encouraged to be more active in identifying and removing content that promotes terrorism, as well as monitoring for extremist activities. The introduction of new cyber laws and amendments to existing ones has enabled law enforcement agencies to keep pace with the evolving tools and tactics used by terrorist organisations. Conclusion The recent charges against the four men from Luton highlight the ongoing challenges faced by law enforcement and security agencies in combatting radicalisation and terrorism in the United Kingdom and beyond. The terrorism charges reflect a strong stance against those who encourage support for extremist groups like the Islamic State, sending a clear message that any form of support for such organisations will not be tolerated.

Light is an awesome director of your body's natural clock. Light naturally makes you wake up and dark naturally makes you tired. Select from: (A). The most common types of natural light there are : E-lamps air conditioners a gas stove an electric fan Install an alarm clock for school. You can either set it to be hitting your clock back and forth, or, you can simply turn the clock up to keep it going. (B). All this power actually comes from the natural way light changes your brain's circadian rhythm, which is what happens when your body's sleep clocks are shut off. Most teens will start waking up in the morning, but some teens will wake up before one. (C). The natural light shifts your body clock to sleep mode, which naturally starts the fall and finish cycle. Put a set of egg whites and a little lemon juice in your kids' room, or use aromatherapy oils like pine or rosemary infused oils. (D). Because not all areas of the globe will actually have the sun at the times you want to get up and go to bed, using a natural light lamp can work just as well. Some of these lights also have built-in sounds that can be played while your kids are falling asleep.","completion":"Option D, incorporating a natural light lamp, is the ideal continuation of the paragraph on how to get your child out of bed in the morning. A natural light lamp is an excellent alternative when natural sunlight is not available or sufficient during your desired wake-up time. These lamps can simulate the sunrise by gradually increasing the light intensity, which in turn helps regulate the body's natural clock, known as the circadian rhythm. By adjusting your child's circadian rhythm to align with their waking routine, you can encourage a more natural and easier wake-up process. Furthermore, some natural light lamps come equipped with built-in sounds, such as bird songs or soothing nature sounds, that can be played while your kids are falling asleep. These additional features can not only promote relaxation during bedtime but also foster a pleasant wake-up experience when the light and sounds gradually intensify to signal the start of a new day. Besides using a natural light lamp, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a calming bedtime routine are crucial factors in promoting healthy sleep patterns for your child. This includes discouraging screen time close to bedtime, as the blue light emitted from screens can interfere with the natural production of melatonin, a hormone responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles. In summary, to help your child wake up more easily and naturally in the morning, consider installing a natural light lamp in their bedroom. This effective tool regulates the body's circadian rhythm in the absence of actual sunlight and can be enhanced with soothing sounds for both bedtime and morning routines, fostering a seamless transition between sleep and wakefulness. Coupled with a consistent sleep schedule and a relaxing bedtime environment, your child will be better equipped to embrace both restful nights and energetic mornings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kent village remained traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. Long Grove on the other hand took a wider perspective and created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all played an important role in developing Long Grove village. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village took a more complex approach to rural development? Hint: Rural development is the process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of people living in rural areas, often relatively isolated and sparsely populated areas.[1] Rural development has traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. However, changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas. Increasingly tourism, niche manufacturers, and recreation have replaced resource extraction and agriculture as dominant economic drivers.[2] The need for rural communities to approach development from a wider perspective has created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all play an important role in developing rural regions.[3] Rural development is also characterized by its emphasis on locally produced economic development strategies.[4] In contrast to urban regions, which have many similarities, rural areas are highly distinctive from one another. For this reason there are a large variety of rural development approaches used globally.[5] Rural development is a comprehensive term. It essentially focuses on action for the development of areas outside the mainstream urban economic system. we should think of what type of rural development is needed because modernization of village leads to urbanization and village environment disappears.

Former Attorneys General say Justice Department's AP operation highly unusual The Justice Department is obligated to investigate leaks that could endanger national security, but the secret seizure of Associated Press telephone records – called a \\"massive and unprecedented intrusion\\" by the news organization – is unusual, according to two former attorneys general. The Associated Press announced Monday that the DOJ obtained two months of telephone records of reporters and editors without the news organization's knowledge. The records obtained by the department listed outgoing calls for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters, for general AP office numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Conn., and for the main number for the AP in the House of Representatives press gallery, according to attorneys for the AP. While the subject of the probe remains unknown, the news organization suggests it may have been related to a May 7, 2012, AP story about a foiled terror plot. Officials have previously said in public testimony that the U.S. attorney in Washington is conducting a criminal investigation into who may have provided information for the AP's story, which disclosed details of a CIA operation in Yemen that stopped an Al Qaeda plot in the spring of 2012 to detonate a bomb on an airplane bound for the U.S. - Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who served in the Bush administration, said Tuesday that the Justice Department is \\"obligated\\" to investigate leaks of classified information that may pose a threat to national security. Gonzales, however, declined to elaborate further, noting that the facts of the DOJ's investigation are still emerging. Gonzales called such probes \\"fairly unusual,\\" but said they are necessary if information given to journalists relates to \\"something that is threatening the national security of our country or the lives of American citizens. \\"Let's say that a publication runs a story identifying the names of CIA agents overseas,\\" Gonzales told FoxNews.com. \\"Obviously that's a violation of law and a serious breach of national security. In that case, the department would feel obligated to do everything it possibly could to uncover the leak.\\" Gonzales said under the Bush administration, such an investigation would have required the approval of a deputy attorney general and likely the attorney general. But he said he could not speak for the Obama administration, saying guidance within its DOJ might not have required Attorney General Eric Holder to know of the probe. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who succeeded Gonzales in the Bush administration, said leaks are serious business, but expressed reservations about the scope of the DOJ action. \\"When it comes to national security, I think the government has every right to investigate,\\" Mukasey said. \\"People do not have a right to leak confidential government information.\\" However, Mukasey noted, they have to do it with a \\"narrow focus.\\" \\"The AP suggests it was a broader gathering of information that should never have been authorized,\\" he told Fox News. Mukasey said it would be troubling if it is found that \\"they [the government] were looking more broadly to discourage people to talk to reporters.\\" Mark Corallo, chief spokesman for another Bush attorney general, John Ashcroft, called the secret probe \\"unprecedented.\\" \\"The normal course of business is very narrow and very tailored to a particular individual’s phone records,\\" said Corallo, who served for three years as director of public affairs under Ashcroft. \\"The idea that they would do two months – grab everything – in several bureaus is truly stunning and disgraceful.\\" Press organizations also lashed out at the DOJ, claiming their investigation constitutes a gross abuse of the First Amendment. \\"I don’t think there’s any justifiable situation, ever, for a subpoena this broad without contacting the organization first,\\" said Gregg Leslie, legal defense director of Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Leslie said Nixon-era guidelines for the Attorney General’s Office speak directly to subpoenaing phone records of news organizations. He called them a \\"well-established body of law.\\" \\"You have to try to first negotiate\\" with the news organization, Leslie said. Rules published by the Justice Department require that subpoenas of records of news organizations must be personally approved by the attorney general, but it was not known if that happened in this case. The letter notifying AP that its phone records had been obtained through subpoenas was sent Friday by Ronald Machen, the U.S. attorney in Washington. William Miller, a spokesman for Machen, said Monday that, in general, the U.S. attorney follows \\"all applicable laws, federal regulations and Department of Justice policies when issuing subpoenas for phone records of media organizations.\\" But he would not address questions about the specifics of the AP records. \\"We do not comment on ongoing criminal investigations,\\" Miller said in an email.

Allow me to suggest some tips that may help you stick to your decisions creating long- lasting positive change in your life. Telling other people about your plan can help in many ways. First, it is always easier to stick to a decision when you have other people supporting you. Your friends are less likely to tempt you with whatever it is you are trying to control if they know that you made a decision about it. Telling other people about your decision is also helpful in that it keeps us to the pressure on you to try and stick to you plan of action. Choose a measurable and specific decision. Instead of deciding to \\"look better\\" or \\"have a better relationship with so and so\\", choose a more definable decision. Deciding to \\"eat a vegetable every day\\" or \\"go out for coffee once a week with John\\" is much easier to track and assess than a general decision to \\"be a better person\\". Build a reward system. Connected to the last tip of choosing a measurable and specific decision is that when you do accomplish this specific behavior you decided to do, give yourself small rewards along the process. For example, for every week of healthy eating treat yourself with something special. Creative visual aids. A colleague of mine decided one year for his New Year's decision to be more frugal.

Write a sentence that describes this data","completion":"This set of data suggests a relationship between Adenan Satem and Abdul Taib Mahmud, where Adenan Satem held a certain office while Abdul Taib Mahmud was serving as the Vice President. Adenan Satem, a prominent figure in Malaysian politics, served as the Chief Minister of Sarawak, one of Malaysia's states, from 2014 up until his demise in 2017. His tenure saw a multitude of initiatives being put in place for the development and betterment of the state. Meanwhile, Abdul Taib Mahmud is another significant character in the political arena of Malaysia. He has had a lengthy political career and has held numerous high-ranking posts, the most notable of which was his tenure as the Chief Minister of Sarawak for 33 years, from 1981 to 2014. An influential figure, his time in office was marked by ambitious development projects, although he also drew criticism for alleged corruption and environmental degradation. The data provided seems to suggest a period when Adenan Satem held office concurrently with Abdul Taib Mahmud. This could refer to the time when Adenan Satem served under Abdul Taib Mahmud's long reign as Chief Minister. Alternatively, it could also refer to a lesser-known period when both members were serving in different capacities within the government. The relationship between Adenan Satem and Abdul Taib Mahmud is of historical significance and formed a noteworthy chapter in Malaysia's political landscape. It marked a period where substantial changes in policy and direction were made, including a stronger emphasis on state autonomy and the protection of the rights of indigenous people. These changes were largely credited to Adenan Satem's leadership while Abdul Taib Mahmud transitioned to the role of the Governor of Sarawak. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed analysis. Depending on the roles they played at the time, their relationship could have been that of collaboration or confrontation, mentorship or rivalry, or either intricate political maneuvering or straightforward administrative ties. It's worth noting that the dynamics between these two figures would have also been influenced by the wider political climate of Malaysia at the time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population. Hypothesis: A habitat refers to the food eaten by an animal.","completion":"Let's review the context step-by-step and see if we can draw the given hypothesis. Step 1: Understand the definition of habitat The context defines a habitat as an ecological or environmental area inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other organism.

Please answer the following question: Two twin sisters were taken to the doctor's office by their parents. It turned out that Mary had hemophilia while Ann didn't have any blood disease. Which sister had blood that was able to clot? Hint: Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Ann is the sister whose blood was able to clot.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What was the purpose of the many battles in Spain and how long did it take\\" is \\"To retake the land\\"?","completion":"Yes, that's right!

The painting was stolen by an Italian handyman named Vincenzo Peruggia, who believed that the artwork should be returned to Italy. He had worked at the museum and knew the layout well. One day, he hid inside the museum overnight and took the painting. It was missing for over two years before it was recovered in 1913. Another possible interpretation could be the scandal surrounding the Panama Canal. In the late 19th and early 20th century, French and American interests competed over the rights to build the Panama Canal. In France, this erupted into a major scandal involving government corruption and the loss of a great deal of public money, known as the Panama Scandal. Alternatively, the statement might refer to something much broader, like the myriad social and cultural changes Paris went through in the early years of the 20th century. The so-called \\"Belle Epoque\\" period, lasting from 1871 to 1914, was a time of great optimism, peace, prosperity, and progress in France, particularly in Paris. However, it was also a time of socioeconomic divide and struggles, which came to a boiling point in the years preceding World War I. These are just some of the many possible interpretations of such a general statement, which does not provide much detail or specific context. Each of the events mentioned was highly sensational in its time, and each had profound, lasting impacts on the city of Paris and the world at large."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Some years ago a woman on our staff came into my office to, basically, tell me off and complain to me about others and about myself. This woman had not been very supportive of me in my role ever since I began working there. I couldn’t figure out if she was arrogant or lacking in self esteem. During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable. What can I do?” We spent some time discussing what she could do, and (even though I didn’t want to take the time to do it) I asked her if she would like a mentor — me? She said that she would like such a thing. This woman and I ended up becoming fairly, no, very good friends and she has been one of my strongest supporters. I didn’t expect that.

Primarily consisting of lead vocalists Jeanette Jurado, Ann Curless, and Gioia Bruno, the group achieved much of their success between 1984 and 1993, becoming the first group to have four top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from its debut album, including the 1988 #1 hit \\"Seasons Change\\". In March 2015, Billboard magazine named the group the eighth most-successful girl group of all-time. The group was popular in dance clubs, mainstream Top 40 and adult contemporary charts in the United States. During the recording of the group's first studio album Exposure, the personnel of the group changed. Reports vary based on the source. According to People magazine, one of the original singers quit while two of the girls were fired midway through the recording of the first album, but according to Billboard, all three were fired. Arista records felt that the three original singers lacked star potential. Martinee states that he made the decision himself to replace the three girls, while Miller maintains it was all their choice, and Jurado confirms that Lorenzo wanted to leave. Shortly thereafter, Casanas pursued a solo career and Lorenzo pursued other ambitions; they were replaced by Jeanette Jurado and Gioia Bruno. Miller began a solo career; she was replaced by Ann Curless. Lorenzo returned to the dance charts with the Vendetta Records releases \\"I Wanna Know\\" in 1988, and \\"Stop Me if I Fall in Love\\" in 1990, while Laurie Miller released the 12\\" single \\"Parallels\\" on Atlantic Records and a second single \\"Love is a Natural Magical Thing\\" on Meet Me In Miami Records. Laurie evolved into a headline performer frequently showcasing her talents on cruises with a more intimate jazz style, and formed her own entertainment company called Xica productions. Casanas later resurfaced as a solo artist (Sandee) and released a solo album, Only Time Will Tell, which garnered the club hits \\"You're The One\\", \\"Love Desire\\", and the Clivilles & Cole-produced bassline-heavy hit \\"Notice Me\\". She continued to tour actively in dance clubs and freestyle shows, until her death on December 15, 2008, of a seizure at the age of 46. All three original members: Casanas, Lorenzo and Miller later contributed vocals on songs on the Miami group Will to Power's eponymous 1988 debut album. Gioia Bruno also provided lead vocals on Will to Power's 2004 album, Spirit Warrior. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects present in this article: 1. The Shift in Group Personnel: One key aspect that stands out is the revolving door of group members during the recording of their first album, \\"Exposure\\". Depending on the sources, explanations vary from members quitting, getting fired or replacing due to lack of star potential. With Jeanette Jurado, Gioia Bruno, and Ann Curless replacing the original members, the group's dynamics underwent a dramatic change. 2. Members' Solo Careers and Endeavours: Post their stint with Exposé, the original group members explored various opportunities - from pursuing solo careers to setting up an entertainment company. Ale Lorenzo returned to the dance charts with multiple releases while Laurie Miller turned into a headline performer, often showcasing her talents on cruises and forming her own entertainment company, Xica Productions. Sandee Casanas emerged as a solo artist with her album producing several club hits. These individual trajectories mark interesting developments in each of the members' careers. 3. Association with Will to Power: An interesting nugget is the collaboration between the former and current Exposé members with another Miami-based group, Will to Power. Both the original and new members contributed vocals on songs on Will to Power's debut album and later albums, suggesting ongoing collaborations within the music scene. 4. Tragic Loss: Sadly, original member Sandee Casanas passed away at the age of 46 due to a seizure. Her contributions to music, particularly in dance clubs and freestyle shows up to her untimely death, display a persevering spirit and dedication to her craft. This is a poignant part of the group's history. 5. Steady Success: Despite the shift in members, Exposé managed to achieve steady success throughout their active years, with multiple hits on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2015, Billboard named them the eighth most successful girl group of all time, which further signals their significance in the music industry. Overall, the continual evolution of the band, their individual strands of success, and the lasting impact they've had on the music industry makes their journey quite captivating and intriguing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He led the Baltimore Colts to NFL championships in 1958 and 1959 and the New York Jets to victory in Super Bowl III in 1969. He is the only coach to win a championship in both the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL). Ewbank moved back to Oxford in retirement and wrote a book in 1977 called Football Greats. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that he was glad to be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent. Ewbank's coaching style was laid-back but efficient, combining his mild personality with an orderliness inherited from Paul Brown. \\"Weeb combined a low-key style with a flair for the most dramatic of accomplishments\\", former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in 1998. \\"He led two of the legendary teams during the era of pro football's greatest growth. But he preferred to stay in the background and let the players take the credit.\\" He favored well-practiced execution of a limited number of plays over complicated offensive and defensive systems. Paul Brown \\"had the exact same approach: Don't do too much, but what you do, execute it flawlessly\\", Raymond Berry said in 2013, adding that the Colts' 1958 championship team had only six passing plays. Ewbank is the only man to coach two professional football teams to championships, and the only man to win the NFL championship, the AFL championship and a Super Bowl. Ewbank's regular-season career record in the NFL and AFL was 130-129-7, and his playoff record was 4-1. Ewbank was selected as the head coach on the AFL All-Time Team in 1970. In addition to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was inducted into the Miami University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1969, the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1974 and the Talawanda School District Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999. He also won the Walter Camp Distinguished American Award in 1987 and was inducted into the Jets' Ring of Honor in 2010. Ewbank suffered a dislocated hip in the aftermath of the Jets' 1968 AFL championship game win, and had other health issues in his later years. He broke his leg and had two hip replacements in the 1990s. He also had myasthenia in his right eye. Ewbank died at 91 on November 17, 1998, the 30th anniversary of the \\"Heidi Game\\", after suffering from heart problems. He and his wife Lucy had three daughters.

Some people are scared of change or think the caste system is helpful for keeping things in order, even though it's not fair to everyone. 3.

I walked up to the counter. Behind it was a lady like no one I'd ever seen. Fake-jewel-encrusted glasses teetered on the tip of her nose, gray hair was piled on her head. \\"Excuse me,\\" I said.

If you're lucky you'll be home by sundown.\\" Sundown was five hours away. I wasn't sure I would make it. I scanned the nearest shelf for the first item on my list: pork and beans. It took me three wall-to-wall searches before I found a can nestled between boxes of cereal and bread. Next up was toilet paper, found under the daily newspaper. Band-Aids --where had I seen them? Oh, ye next to the face cream. The store was a puzzle, but it held some surprises too. I found a new Superman comic tucked behind the peanut butter. I visited Miss Bee a couple of times a week that summer. Sometimes she short-changed me. Other times she overcharged. Or sold me an old newspaper instead of one that was current. Going to the store was more like going into battle. I left my Grandma's house armed with my list--memorized to the letter--and marched into Miss...

Like any other constantly repeated action, speaking has to be learned, but once it is learned, it becomes a generally unconscious and apparently automatic process. As far as we can determine, human beings do not need to be forced to speak; most babies seem to possess a sort of instinctive drive to produce speech like noises. How to speak and what to say are another matter altogetner. There actions are learned from the particular society into which the baby is born; so that, like all conduct that is learned from a society--from the people around us--speech is a patterned activity. The meandering babble and chatter of a young child are eventually channeled by imitation into a few orderly grooves that represent the pattern accepted as meaningful by the people around him. Similarly, a child's indiscriminate practice of putting things into his mouth becomes limited to putting food into his mouth in a certain way. The sounds that a child can make are more varied and numerous than the sounds that any particular language uses. However, a child born into a society with a pattem of language is encouraged to make a small selection of sounds and to make these few sounds over and over until it is natural for him to make these sounds and not others.

Question: What was the effect of the Rotavirus vaccine? Answer: In the case of Rotavirus, which was responsible for around 6% of diarrheal episodes and 20% of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries, use of a Rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight (2-3%) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence, while reducing overall mortality by 6-10%. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? OPT: (A). yes (B). no","completion":"(A). yes The introduction of the Rotavirus vaccine had a significant impact on global health, particularly in children living in developing countries. The vaccine primarily protects against severe gastrointestinal illness caused by Rotavirus, which presents as acute diarrhea and can lead to severe dehydration. Before the vaccine's introduction, Rotavirus was the leading cause of severe diarrhea among infants and young children, resulting in an estimated 528,000 deaths annually around the world. The development and subsequent distribution of Rotavirus vaccines have profoundly changed the landscape of diarrheal diseases, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The first Rotavirus vaccine, RotaShield, entered the market in 1998 but was withdrawn shortly after due to concerns about a rare but severe side effect, intussusception. The second-generation vaccines, RotaTeq and Rotarix, received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and are currently widely used. These vaccines led to a substantial decrease in childhood diarrhea and deaths caused by Rotavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the inclusion of the Rotavirus vaccine in national immunization programs in 2009. It has since been introduced in over 100 countries, including many low- and middle-income regions where the Rotavirus burden is particularly high. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the Rotavirus vaccine. A study published in The Lancet in 2019 reported that the widespread use of Rotavirus vaccines saved an estimated 28,808 lives in 2016 alone. Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that Rotavirus vaccines have reduced the number of severe diarrhea cases by 40-60%. These vaccines have decreased the need for diarrhea-related hospitalizations and outpatient visits, as well. Beyond direct effects on children who receive the vaccine, Rotavirus vaccination also contributes to herd immunity. Herd immunity occurs when a large enough proportion of the population becomes immune to a disease, either by vaccination or previous infection, thereby indirectly protecting those who are not immune. This phenomenon helps reduce the overall transmission of Rotavirus, protecting vulnerable populations such as infants too young for vaccination, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. In conclusion, the Rotavirus vaccine has had several significant effects, such as: 1. A considerable reduction in severe diarrhea cases and diarrhea-related deaths among infants and children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. 2. Decreased need for hospitalizations and outpatient visits due to Rotavirus infection. 3. The contribution to herd immunity, which helps protect vulnerable populations and reduce the overall transmission of the virus. Despite these successes, there is still work to do to ensure global access to Rotavirus vaccines and further reduce the burden of Rotavirus-associated disease and death."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: \\"What was Antarctica once connected to?\\" Context: \\"Antarctica continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent ice cap. Mountain building in western North America continued, and the Alps started to rise in Europe as the African plate continued to push north into the Eurasian plate, isolating the remnants of Tethys Sea. A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe. There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar. During the Oligocene, South America was finally detached from Antarctica and drifted north toward North America. It also allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to flow, rapidly cooling the continent.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"During the early Oligocene epoch, Antarctica was once connected to both South America and Australia. These land connections allowed the exchange of flora and fauna between these southern continents. As the tectonic plates shifted, South America and Australia gradually separated from Antarctica, leading to the continent's increasing isolation. The detachment of South America from Antarctica during the Oligocene caused the formation of the Drake Passage, which eventually allowed the establishment of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. This ocean current played a crucial role in the rapid cooling of Antarctica, resulting in the development of a permanent ice cap on the continent. Additionally, it's worth noting that there appears to have been a land bridge between North America and Europe during the early Oligocene epoch, evidenced by the similarities in their faunas."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Republicans, led by presumptive new Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, of coal-loving Kentucky, have already criticized the Beijing agreement. But what can McConnell and the GOP really do to stop it? The deal is not a formal treaty, so Obama will not need the Senate to approve it. And while Republicans could pass bills to block provisions of the deal from going into effect, doing so would probably not be much more than symbolic, since Obama can simply click his veto pen into action. The constitution requires two-thirds of the Senate and House to vote to override a veto, and despite their recent wins, the GOP still doesn’t have those kinds of majorities. But while Obama and the executive branch agencies that he controls, like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), can act on their own to implement the agreement, under the US constitution’s system of checks and balances, Congress pulls the pursestrings. When the next bill containing the EPA’s budget – or the next omnibus piece of legislation to keep the entire government running – comes round, Republicans can attach provisions called “riders” that would undermine, defund and restrict parts of the climate plan. Clinging to an unrelated bill like legislative barnacles, riders could, for example, prevent the EPA from using any money to actually enforce the rules and regulations necessary to implement the agreement. Riders on an omnibus budget could also put the president in a pickle: unless Obama signs legislation to cripple his own major accomplishment, he could risk shutting down the government. That could flip the circumstances of the 2013 government shutdown, making Obama look like the villain who refuses to keep the government going, and turning Republicans into the reasonable lawmakers who “get us out of government shutdowns”, as McConnell put it. Republicans could also try to bargain with the president, using narrowly written bills as leverage, getting victories of their own while perhaps conceding something to Democrats in exchange. Obama has never spoken out particularly strongly against the Keystone XL pipeline, for instance, and both parties could try to use it as a bargaining chip. The GOP could also simply try to clog the works a bit. Senator Jim Inhofe, the author of The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future, would have some power to do that as chair of the environmental committee. Inhofe will likely launch investigations, hindering and possibly delaying implementation of the agreement with hearings and squads of investigators. Green energy projects will be examined with a microscope; green investments decried. Zones of EPA jurisdiction, as tiny as a stream or strait or islet, will be argued and bickered about, and officials in the EPA will have their lives made miserable as senators try to cow them with pressure. Inhofe can also contest EPA rulings like the “endangerment finding”, under which the agency declared that greenhouse gases were a danger to public health and merited regulation. Reports by Inhofe’s investigators can then be used by businesses who challenge the EPA in court, sending the “war on coal and oil” into the long and expensive trenches of the judicial system. And like most political agendas, there’s always the next election to consider: if the GOP can handcuff the EPA as long as possible, they may be able to play the electoral field into a 2016 win, getting a less-green president in office and shutting the whole thing down. ||||| A visit to Beijing by Kerry and a missive from Obama were key moments in a nine-month negotiation between the world’s biggest polluters The climate deal announced on Wednesday between the world’s two biggest carbon polluters was struck after a personal letter from Barack Obama, and nine months of intensive diplomacy. But American and Chinese officials had been in search of an agreement – through official meetings and back-channel negotiations – since the days when George Bush was president. The plan unveiled in Beijing by Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, commits the two countries to ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions after 2020, and could spur other big polluters to similar efforts. After years of mistrust, the deal began to coalesce last spring after Obama sent a personal letter to Xi suggesting the two countries start to move in tandem to cut carbon pollution, the White House said. The immediate inspiration for the letter arose from a visit to Beijing by John Kerry, the US secretary of state. Kerry, who had a strong environmental record when he was a senator, raised climate change to a top priority after taking over at State. He floated the idea of setting joint targets in his meetings with Chinese officials, a senior administration official said. “The idea was first hatched in a bilateral visit that Secretary Kerry had in early February, where he broached it with the Chinese,” the official said. “And when the Chinese side seemed potentially receptive, we followed up with that letter from President Obama to President Xi.” What came next was a flurry of diplomatic meetings – including a pivotal encounter on the sidelines of the United Nations climate summit in September between Obama and the Chinese vice-premier Zhang Gaoli, who has charge of climate and energy. At the time, there was speculation that China would use the spotlight of the UN summit to announce a date for peaking emissions. That did not materialise. The timing was too close to the midterm elections and China was adamant about making the historic announcement from home turf, those who have followed the talks closely said. But the White House said Zhang did tell Obama during a meeting that China wanted to move ahead quickly on a separate climate deal. “The message from Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli was that President Xi was interested in taking the president’s offer up and moving forward with this announcement when we were in Beijing,” the official said. A number of US officials were dispatched to Beijing, including the senior White House adviser on climate policy, John Podesta, and the State Department climate change envoy, Todd Stern, the White House said. By early November, officials were parsing the language of an eventual announcement – a process that evidently went down to the wire, in the official’s account. “We were here the week before last and had intensive discussions about what our respective targets would look like, and then finally were able to negotiate a text which was finalised late yesterday.” By the time it reached that crunch point, however, US and Chinese officials had spent the better part of two years trying to overcome their mutual suspicion – and nearly a decade in on-off negotiations for a two-way climate deal. After the disaster of the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, when Obama was on the receiving end of a pointed diplomatic snub from Chinese officials, the two countries began to put in the hard work needed to repair the relationship. As those familiar with United Nations climate negotiations recognised, there was no other way. China and America between them are responsible for 42% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US EIA’s 2012 data. Unless they were serious about cutting carbon pollution, there was no hope of fighting climate change. The primacy of the US-Chinese relationship was familiar to a number of highly placed officials in the Obama administration. Beginning in late 2007, when George Bush was president, a group of leading Republicans and Democrats led two secretive missions to China to try to secure a bilateral climate agreement. The initiative included John Holdren, now the White House science adviser, and culminated in a meeting at a luxury hotel at the Great Wall of China in July 2008. It also produced a draft agreement in March 2009, two months after Obama took office, but it was never signed. Obama’s hopes of passing a climate law died in Congress. After his re-election, however, Obama recommitted to fighting climate change, and again took up pursuit of the China deal. “At the beginning of the second term the president recognised that he had to both take domestic action to have credibility but also to begin bilateral negotiations with China to actually bend down the global emissions curve,” said Paul Bledsoe, a climate change official under Bill Clinton. “From the moment of his re-election, this process began. This is essentially the culmination of two years of effort, recognising that until Chinese emissions begin to decline, global emissions cannot decline. That is just the reality of the problem.” On the diplomatic track, US and Chinese officials were signing agreements to work together on developing technologies for the smart grid, cleaner vehicles and energy-saving buildings. The trust-building exercises paid off. In June 2013 Obama and Xi reached an agreement to phase out the super-pollutant HFCs – an extremely potent greenhouse gas used in air conditioners and refrigerators. Industrialised countries adopted the agreement a few months later. Obama, meanwhile, began assembling evidence that he was serious about cutting greenhouse gas emissions at home – and not just demanding such actions from other countries. Shortly after the HFC deal, Obama unveiled his signature plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, the single biggest source of carbon pollution. China also began to put its own house in order, spurred in part by deadly air pollution levels from coal-fired power plants. In 2011, the Chinese government for the first time set targets for a less polluting course of growth, and began rolling out new solar and wind plants. Seven regions introduced carbon trading schemes. By the beginning of this year, all the pieces were beginning to fall into place. It had been, in Bledsoe’s view, the work of a decade. “Todd [Stern] and Podesta and Holdren were all working on these issues in the late 1990s,” he said. “Until about two or three years ago there was still a broader focus on the UN negotiations rather than the bilateral relationship with China as the sine qua non of climate protection. That is what changed after the re-election: the recognition that this was essentially the only game in town.” |||||Summary:","completion":"The Obama administration's climate change deal with China has faced opposition from the Republican Congress, who have criticized the agreement and are looking for ways to hinder its implementation. Although the deal is not a formal treaty, which means it does not require Senate approval, the Republican Congress is exploring various tactics to undermine it. These tactics include attaching provisions called \\"riders\\" to budget bills related to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which could defund or restrict parts of the climate plan. Additionally, they can use these riders to put pressure on Obama to sign legislation to limit his own climate plan, otherwise risking a government shutdown. Another approach Republicans might take is to negotiate with the president, offering concessions in exchange for their own political victories. Furthermore, they can utilize the powers of Senator Jim Inhofe, a prominent climate change skeptic, to hinder the implementation of the agreement through investigations and legal challenges. This opposition from the Republican Congress highlights the challenges the Obama administration faces in enacting its climate change policy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Chronicon Lethrense and the included Annales Lundenses tell that Haldan (Healfdene) had two sons, Helghe (Halga) and Ro (Hrodgar). When Haldan died of old age, Helghe and Ro divided the kingdom so that Ro ruled the land, and Helghe the sea. One day, Helghe arrived in Halland/Lolland and slept with Thore, the daughter of one of Ro's farmers. This resulted in a daughter named Yrse. Much later, he met Yrse, and without knowing that she was his daughter, he made her pregnant with Rolf. Eventually, Helghe found out that Yrse was his own daughter and, out of shame, went east and killed himself. Both Helghe and Ro being dead, a Swedish king, called Hakon in the Chronicon Lethrense proper, and Athisl in the Annales - corresponding to Eadgils - forced the Danes to accept a dog as king. The dog king was succeeded by Rolf Krage. Rolf Krage was a big man in body and soul and was so generous that no one asked him for anything twice. His sister Skulda was married against Rolf's will to Hartwar or Hiarwarth (Heoroweard), a German earl of Skane, but reputedly Rolf had given Skulda to him together with Sweden. This Hartwar arrived in Zealand with a large army and said that he wanted to give his tribute to Rolf, but killed Rolf together with all his men.

Article: Many articles have appeared in recent years, claiming that there are no more heroes in the world. The authors says that the young now refuse to admire anyone and that we are living in a world too well informed, too curious showing us the faults of the public figures who could become today's stars, until we lose faith and start looking for defects in any person who seems worthy of respect. Is it true that we know too much? Were our ancestors lucky to be only partly informed? Those who read the first biographies of George Washington, Joan of Arc, or other great men and women of the past were not told that their hero had bad breath or disliked his mother; they only found a description of his great accomplishments and their admiration was strengthened. In fact, early biographers didn't hesitate to make up an admirable story or two about their hero. The man who wrote the first biography of Washington, for instance, invented the cherry tree; he admitted later that there was no truth in it, but he said that it would give young men a good example to follow. His readers didn't seem to object; the book was reprinted eighty times--a great success in those days. Modern biographers do not invent such stories; they respect the facts, as indeed they should. But we pay a price for their truthfulness, for in their efforts to show \\"the whole person,\\" they tell us more than we really need to know about private lives, family secrets, and human weakness. The true greatness of a fine man is often forgotten in the display; and people lose not only their admiration for him, but their willingness to trust any other \\"star\\" completely. It may be difficult to be a hero in the world these days, under the searching eyes of the society. But surely excellence has not disappeared completely; there are still individuals who are superior to their fellow men by their wisdom, their courage, or their character. They can be heroes if people are willing to ignore their human imperfection and to admit the respect that their admirable qualities... Question: Why do the young now refuse to admire anyone? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The article suggests that the reluctance of young people to admire anyone stems from the excessive amount of information available about public figures. With increasing access to information in our modern world, it’s easy to know almost every detail about these public figures, including their flaws, mistakes, and other shortcomings. This wider perspective reveals the human aspects and potential flaws of public figures, challenging the traditional concept of a hero, which often omits the narration of such shortcomings. The continuous exposure to such negative or unexpected details of highly respected figures could make young people skeptical and less willing to admire or respect anyone unconditionally. Unlike the earlier times, where biographies typically highlighted only the great deeds, people now have a more holistic view of other's lives which notably includes their imperfections."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation. Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Is OTHER wrong in the post ? POST : When my mom was 18 she hooked up with a guy named Bryan who was 17 and together they had me. Bryan didn’t want to be a father so he left my mother. Years later my mom met a guy named Ryan and had a kid with her named Ellie. Then later my mom gets with another guy named Kyle and they have a kid named Laurie. Ryan, my first step-dad. My mom and him used to switch Ellie and I every week. Ryan is with a girl named Amy. Amy had a kid named Lyle. They had a kid together named Winston. About a year ago I came out and told my second step-dad Kyle that Ryan’s father, Chris, had been sexually harassing me for the past year. To name a few things he did: -He offered to buy me a dildo. When I laughed and said my parents wouldn’t like that he said I didn’t have to tell them -I was in a night gown one night and he was making a movement with his hands and when I looked down I realized he was staring at my privates under my night gown -He would constantly rub my thighs closer to the parts I didn’t want him to touch -He would groom me by getting me foods -He shoved his hand down my shirt and tried to grab at my chest. I slapped his hand away -When I told him about my online boyfriend he asked me if I had ever orgasmed before. I said “maybe” and he said “you haven’t. If you did you would have known.” Once I told Kyle he told me I could stay with them. Ryan wanted me to be the one to fix our relationship after everything that happened. I had to get therapy and deal with all the pain and trauma his father caused all on my own. Now for the part why I’m truly mad at his side of the family: They abandoned me. I tried so hard to try and fix things with Ryan. I’ve had an incredibly hard time dealing with the pain and trauma of all of this. I break down a lot and sometimes someone just touching me slightly makes me think that Chris is there trying to touch me. Ryan’s entire family all think I’m an asshole, even Ellie. Ellie and I used to be so close but now she basically hates me and yells at me whenever she gets the chance. I don’t know what to do. Am I an asshole for reporting Chris? For the past year I’ve struggled with this question and I guess asking a bunch of people on reddit is how I’ll decide. Note: Please don’t come on the post and comment that Chris didn’t actually harass me sexually or that I’m not really trans because I wore a night gown at one time. None of that will help me figure out if I am the asshole or not.","completion":"Part #1: Identify the complex ethical situation in the post. Usage: The complex ethical situation in this post involves the author experiencing sexual harassment from Chris, Ryan's father, and the subsequent fallout within the family after reporting the harassment. Part #2: Identify the subject of the question (AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER) Usage: In this case, the question is asking if OTHER (Chris) is wrong in the situation. Part #3: Answer the question. Usage: Yes, OTHER (Chris) is wrong in this situation because he sexually harassed the author. Part #4: Classify the answer into \\"yes\\" or \\"no.\\" Usage: The answer is classified as \\"yes\\" because Chris was indeed wrong in the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the people Beatrix wants to prove wrong? from the following article ? The story begins with Beatrix Potter nervously packing her portfolio and narrating that she is a London spinster, and that her ambition to become a children's author meets with wide disapproval. She and her chaperone, Miss Wiggin, visit the publishing house of Harold and Fruing Warne, who decide to publish her book. Beatrix is thrilled and returns home, taking a drive through the parks to celebrate first. However, it is revealed the Warne brothers think her book is ridiculous and will no doubt be a failure. The only reason they agreed to publish it is because they promised their younger brother, Norman, a project. When Norman Warne visits Beatrix, they make decisions about her book regarding size, colour and price. Norman admits he has never done anything like this before but has given her book a great deal of thought. Beatrix realises what Norman's brothers have done regarding him and her, but they become determined to prove them wrong. Norman takes Beatrix to the printer, and she has her drawings reproduced and copies of her book sold. Thrilled, Beatrix and Norman visit the Warne family, where Beatrix meets the wheelchair-bound but lovely Mrs. Warne, and Norman's sister, Amelia, nicknamed \\"Millie\\". Millie has decided that she and Beatrix are going to be friends and is overjoyed that Beatrix is a spinster, as is Millie, who believes men to be nothing but bores. The family befriends Beatrix, yet Helen Potter, Beatrix's social-climbing mother, is unhappy about her daughter spending time in the company of 'tradesmen'. The answer is:","completion":"The names of the people Beatrix wants to prove wrong are Harold and Fruing Warne, the Warne brothers who own the publishing house. They believe her book is ridiculous and expect it to be a failure, agreeing to publish it only to give their younger brother, Norman, a project.

This is because St. John's College is categorized as a private liberal arts college, not a public college. However, we can confirm that St. John's College ranks in the top 100 Best Liberal Arts Colleges, as mentioned in the given information. It is important to differentiate between private and public colleges. Private colleges, like St. John's College, are funded by private sources, such as donations and tuition fees, and are not directly funded by the government. Public colleges, on the other hand, are supported by state governments and usually offer lower tuition rates for in-state students. The \\"U.S. News & World Report\\" website provides separate rankings for different types of schools, including national universities, regional universities, liberal arts colleges, and public colleges. While St. John's College ranks highly in the category of liberal arts colleges, we do not have information about its ranking in the public colleges category, as it does not fall under that classification. Thus, it would be incorrect to infer that St. John's College ranks in the top 100 best public colleges based on the provided information. Its distinction as one of the top 100 Best Liberal Arts Colleges, however, is well-established and should not be confused with its standing amongst public colleges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","completion":"In order to solve the equation -3 = r - 0 - 1 for r, you need to follow the steps of simplification and isolating the variable r. Let's break down the process step by step: Given equation: -3 = r - 0 - 1 Step 1: Simplify the equation by removing any unnecessary terms or numbers. Since r - 0 is just r, we can rewrite the equation as: -3 = r - 1 Step 2: Isolate the variable r. In this case, we need to get r by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation. By doing so, we will cancel the -1 on the right side of the equation: -3 + 1 = r - 1 + 1 Which simplifies to: -2 = r Step 3: Check the solution. Now that we have the value of r, we can check if it's the correct solution by plugging it back into the original equation: -3 = (-2) - 0 - 1 Simplifying the equation: -3 = -2 - 1 Which is true, as: -3 = -3 Since our solution checks out, we can conclude that the answer is: r = -2"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The night when she thought she would finally be a star, Maria Isabella du'l Cielo struggled to calm the trembling of her hands, reached over to cut the tether that tied her to the ground, and thought of that morning many years before when she'd first caught a glimpse of Lorenzo du Vicenzio ei Salvadore: tall, thick-browed and handsome, his eyes closed, oblivious to the cacophony of the accident waiting to occur around him. Maria Isabella had just turned sixteen then, and each set of her padrinos had given her (along with the sequined brida du caballo, the dresses of rare tulle, organza, and seda, and the diadema floral du'l dama -- the requisite floral circlet of young womanhood) a purse filled with coins to spend on anything she wanted. And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found. Those she liked very much. In the vicinity of the Plaza Emperyal, she saw a young man dressed in a coat embroidered with stars walk almost surely to his death. In that instant, Maria Isabella knew two things with the conviction reserved only for the very young: first, that she almost certainly loved this reckless man; and second, that if she simply stepped on a dog's tail -- the very dog watching the same scene unfold right next to her -- she could avert the man's seemingly senseless death.

Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life.

Summarize this article in one sentence. The Labour leader said the government was planning to over-ride legal rulings and restrict Personal Independence Payments paid to dementia sufferers and those with mental health conditions. But Mrs May said no existing claimants would see their benefits reduced. She said the government was clarifying the scope of payments to ensure they were in line with original intentions. PIPs, which replaced Disability Living Allowance in 2013, are aimed at helping people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs. Recent tribunal rulings have extended the scope of the payments and who is entitled to them - a move which the government has said will add Â£3.7bn to the benefits bill by 2023 unless it is reviewed. Clashing over the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, the Labour leader said the move - which was announced last Thursday - was a \\"nasty decision\\" and had been \\"sneaked out\\" without any warning. Mr Corbyn said the review would affect 160,000 people with debilitating mental conditions, who had been deemed eligible by the court to get help as they were suffering from \\"overwhelming psychological distress\\". Among those who would lose out, he added, were those recovering from strokes and post-traumatic stress disorder. \\"The reality is that this is a shameful decision,\\" he said. \\"Can she look at the effects of the decision to over-ride what an independent court has decided and think again?\\" \\"As a society we are judged by how we treat the most vulnerable... can't the prime minister withdraw this nasty decision and support those going through a very difficult time in their lives?\\" One tribunal ruling on PIPs in late 2016 found people who needed help take medication or monitor a health condition like diabetes would score the same on the benefits criteria as people who needed help with a therapy such as kidney dialysis A second ruling said people who struggled to travel independently because of conditions such as anxiety scored the same as someone who was, for example, blind. Mrs May said the government's review of the eligibility criteria was \\"not a policy change\\" and Parliament had been told about it in a written statement. Rejecting claims of a lack of consultation, she said the Work and Pensions Secretary had informed the Labour MP who chairs the Work and Pensions Committee about the move and the Social Security Advisory Committee could look into the issue. She said the scope of PIPs had been approved by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government and approved by Parliament but the legal rulings were fundamentally extending their reach and must be returned to their \\"original\\" basis. \\"This is not a cut in the amount that is going to be spent on disability benefits and no-one is going to see a reduction in their benefits from what has been previously awarded,\\" she told MPs. She added: \\"The way we are dealing with disability benefits payments is to ensure payments are going to those who are most vulnerable. \\"What we are doing with regard to PIPs is ensuring\\", she said, that the intentions and decision of this Parliament \\"is being put into practice\\". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said what the government was proposing was \\"not technically a cut\\" but would have ramifications for the benefits system. While some Tory MPs were concerned about the move and ministers were working behind the scenes to allay any fears, she said there was not currently enough \\"heat\\" in the issue to force the government to back down at this stage.","completion":"UK Prime Minister Theresa May has been challenged over the government's decision to restrict Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) for dementia and mental health sufferers, but claims no existing claimants would see their benefits reduced and the government is ensuring payments are in line with original intentions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Dulwich College is a boarding and day independent school for boys in Dulwich in southeast London, England.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: At the beginning, Kaufman's foreign man comes on saying (due to massive editing) it is the end of the film and plays a record alongside the end credits before walking off. Kaufman then comes back on in his normal voice saying he \\"Had to get rid of the people who don't understand me, and don't want to try\\". He then proceeds to show the actual movie on a film projector starting with his childhood home, in Long Island, New York 1957.Flashing forwards to New York City, 1973, Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings childrens songs and overuses his \\"foreign man\\" character. Just as it becomes clear that Kaufman may have no real talent, he puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation and song. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them making his big Elvis payoff all the more enjoyable. This is the first of many times we see Kaufman trick the audience, as \\"fooling the audience\\" is his performance style.His autistic, eccentric style catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who signs him as a client and immediately gets Kaufman on a new sitcom, 'Taxi' in 1975, much to the dismay of sitcom-hating Kaufman. Because of the money, visibility, and chance to do his own television special, Kaufman acts on Taxi, but secretly hates it and works a second menial job as a restaurant busboy. Around this time, he gains popularity by making successful guest appearances on the new show 'Saturday Night Live'.At a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance from a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer named Tony Clifton, whom Andy wants to guest-star several times on Taxi on his terms, and whose bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. When Clifton meets Shapiro privately, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and we see that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a villain character created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti), both of whom... Answer:","completion":"Movie Title: \\"The Grand Illusionist: Unmasking Kaufman\\" The movie \\"The Grand Illusionist: Unmasking Kaufman\\" captures the enigmatic life and career of Andy Kaufman, a comedian and performance artist who consistently and deliberately misled audiences through his unpredictable acts, both on and off stage. Known for his eccentric performance style, Kaufman confounded his fans, critics, and colleagues alike, leaving a lasting impact on the entertainment industry. Set in the 1970s and 1980s, the film takes us on a riveting journey through Kaufman's life, shedding light on his various personas and unconventional methods of entertainment. The story begins with an initial misdirection, as Kaufman's foreign man character announces the end of the film before the movie even starts, foreshadowing that what's about to unfold will continue to deceive and surprise viewers. As Kaufman's career takes off, we witness first-hand the genius and the madness of his myriad creations – from Elvis impersonations and children's song performances to his bumbling foreign man character and the crude alter ego Tony Clifton. The film dives deep into Kaufman's distaste for mainstream sitcoms and his disdain for simply making people laugh, while also showcasing his craftiness in keeping his true intentions hidden. \\"The Grand Illusionist: Unmasking Kaufman\\" explores the relationship between Kaufman and his managers, collaborators, and fellow artists, ultimately revealing that many of these connections were rooted in a shared love of deception and subversion of audience expectations. With the film culminating in a series of climactic moments featuring Kaufman's various characters, the audience is left wondering how much of Kaufman's life and career were part of the act, and how much was genuine. The movie captures the essence of the groundbreaking and enigmatic figure that was Andy Kaufman, simultaneously blending biographical storytelling with the very themes that defined Kaufman's career — illusion, deception, and the relentless pursuit of the unexpected. In the end, \\"The Grand Illusionist: Unmasking Kaufman\\" leaves us pondering the true nature of entertainment, the art of comedy, and the intricate web of reality and fiction intricately woven by an unforgettable artist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is also helpful to get into the habit of washing your hands after you’ve been out in public, or have touched public door handles, elevator buttons, or railings. Your hands are your connection to the world.

This is especially important if either you or the other person are currently feeling ill. But just to be safe, because many illnesses can be contagious when the person isn’t symptomatic, it’s best just to avoid sharing anything, with anyone, that touches your mouth. Make sure your vaccinations and immunizations are up-to-date. If you can’t remember when you last had one, speak to your doctor — in some cases, it’s better to get a shot early than not at all. These immunizations will help keep away many illnesses like the flu or the measles that have a fever as a symptom.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In Depression-era North Carolina, George Pemberton is an ambitious timber baron who meets Serena Shaw, a young woman with a sad past. He falls in love with her, they marry, and Serena comes with George to his land. There, she starts taking control of things, pressuring and questioning George, while remaining affectionate towards him. George's business partner Buchanan feels threatened by her, as she begins to exceed his authority. Things grow worse between George and Buchanan, and Buchanan strikes a deal with the local sheriff, who wants to buy George's land to make a park. George is hurt by Buchanan's betrayal, and Serena convinces George that Buchanan was never his friend. The next day, they both go shooting alone from the group attempting to flush out a bear. After some snide remarks from Buchanan, George contemplates killing him only to hesitate and be seen by Buchanan. As Buchanan cocks his rifle, George fires first and shoots him in the chest. Campbell, George's worker, witnesses the murder, but denies it when Sheriff McDowell inquires. The death is ruled an accident. Serena consoles George and justifies his actions. One day, he sees his illegitimate son, Jacob, posing with his mother, Rachel, for a picture. He feels responsible for the boy, and since Rachel never asked for anything, he begins giving sums of money in envelopes to her for Jacob. Serena remains unaware of this, though she does consider Rachel and the baby a threat. One day, an accident occurs in the forest and Galloway, a mysterious worker, loses his hand to an axe swing. Serena rushes to help him and uses a belt as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding which saves his life.

The Academy Award winning actress, who has been blasted for everything lately from the strict diet she has her kids on to her fancy new cookbook with ridiculously expensive ingredients, is in hot water again after collaborating on a string bikini line for children that she is selling on her GOOP website, which one expert exclusively tells RadarOnline.com sexualizes little girls and inevitably promotes eating disorders. The Melissa Odabash for GOOP “exclusive kids new york bikini set,” retails for 45 and the skimpy string bikini is modeled by a little girl, striking a mature pose, on the GOOP website. PHOTOS: Gwyneth Paltrow Is Featured In Self Magazine “This kind of sexualized children’s bikini line is not in girls’ best interest,” Eating Disorder Specialist and Cognitive Behavioral Therapist Dr. Carol Fishbein, Ph.D. tells RadarOnline.com exclusively about the sexy swimsuits. “We are sexualizing young, innocent children, before they will know how to protect themselves or be fully aware of what could be happening to them. With verbal comments, lewd looks or even worse.” PHOTOS: Gywneth Paltrow Looks Flawless At Forty At The Golden Heart Gala Fishbein specifies that the fact the bikinis are held together by strings is extremely disturbing in itself, because they not only promote eating disorders, but they keep children from getting to engage in normal beach activities and enjoying the innocence of their youth. “These kinds of bathing suits promote low self-esteem, negative body image and eating disorders, because of the focus on the appearance of a young girl and keeping her restricted from being able to run around and enjoy the health and power of her own body through running and splashing in the water, jumping, doing somersaults and headstands,” she says. PHOTOS: Gwyneth Paltrow Shares Family Vacation Snaps from St Lucia “These bikinis are tied together with flimsy strings that easily open, contributing to a girl having to check and recheck her skimpy sexualized clothing rather than enjoying her power and her body,” the therapist adds. As girls will inevitably be sexualized later on in their youth, she firmly believes that it is a parent’s duty to protect them when they are still very young. “Parents should make clothing choices that protect the innocence of their children. These bathing suits call attention to sexuality and this will get in the way of children enjoying the joy of their bodies as innocent, protected children, which they are more entitled to. Sexy chic will be upon them soon enough, but at age 4 if we can’t protect, then what is wrong with us?” WATCH: Gwyneth Paltrow & Robert Downey, Jr. In Iron Man 3 Trailer Instead of focusing on how a little girl looks, parents should focus more on who she is as a person, Dr. Fishbein suggests. “What we want is for young girls to have fun in their life and develop their athletic abilities, recognize the ability to develop friendships and close relationships within their family; to have school and personality achievements and not to have their values centered on their appearance or sexuality, especially at such a young age.” PHOTOS: 10 Stars Who Have Defended Their Super Skinny Bodies Do you think Gwyneth Paltrow — who is the mother of an eight-year-old daughter, Apple — went too far with collaborating on string bikinis for young girls?

This guide will help you with the process of applying for a passport renewal, breaking down each step to ensure a smooth and hassle-free experience. Step 1: Retrieve Your Old Passport Before you start, it is crucial to have your old passport on hand. This is because you will need the information from it in order to complete the renewal forms accurately. If your passport was lost, damaged, or stolen, you will need to apply for a new passport and report the incident to the authorities. Step 2: Get New Passport Photos The next step is to obtain new passport photos for your passport renewal application. The photos must meet the following requirements: - 2x2 inches in size - Color photo with a white background - Taken within the last six months - Front view, full face, and with a neutral facial expression or a natural smile - Item of clothing that you wear daily, and no head coverings, unless for religious purposes - No glasses, unless you require them for medical reasons Many drugstores, photography studios, and even post offices provide passport photo services. Ensure that you obtain at least two identical photos for your application. Step 3: Download the Correct Form To renew your passport, you will need to complete Form DS-82 (U.S. Passport Renewal Application for Eligible Individuals). You can download this form from the U.S. Department of State website. Some important details you will need to provide in the form include your personal information, emergency contact details, and travel plans (if applicable). Make sure to fill out the form accurately and legibly to avoid delays in processing your application. Step 4: Decide on Passport Options When applying for a passport renewal, you can choose between a passport book, passport card, or both. It is essential to determine which option best suits your travel needs. - Passport Book: A passport book is the most common form of a passport and is required for international air travel. It contains 28 pages for entry and exit stamps, visa stickers, and other travel documentation. A standard passport book is valid for ten years (for applicants 16 years and older) or five years (for applicants under 16). - Passport Card: A passport card is a wallet-sized travel document that can be used for land and sea travel between the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda. However, you cannot use a passport card for international air travel. Like a passport book, a standard passport card is valid for ten years (for applicants 16 years and older) or five years (for applicants under 16). - Both: If you frequently travel across borders by land or sea but also need a passport book for international flights, you can choose to apply for both the passport book and passport card simultaneously. Step 5: Check Processing Times Online Before mailing in your renewal application, it is a good idea to check the current passport processing times on the U.S. Department of State website. Standard processing times vary but can take between 4 to 8 weeks. If you need your passport urgently, expedited processing and overnight delivery options are available at an additional cost. Be prepared to provide proof of your travel itinerary or an emergency situation if opting for expedited processing. Conclusion Applying for a passport renewal can be an easy and hassle-free process when following this step-by-step guide. Ensure that you have your old passport, new passport photos, and the correct form. Decide on the type of passport that meets your travel needs and check the processing times online before submitting your application. With proper planning and preparation, you will be ready to enjoy your international travels with a renewed passport in no time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You will want to find accommodations as close as possible to minimize travel delays. Reliable transportation is also an important consideration, whether you will work with a car service or transportation provided by the hotel or reserve a rental car.","completion":"Additionally, it's vital to consider the specific needs and preferences of the executive(s) you are accommodating. Some executives might prefer luxury hotels, while others might appreciate more low-key or boutique hotels. Location is not just about proximity to work, it's also about what is in the surrounding area. Are there good places to eat or go for a jog? Is the hotel in a safe and lively neighborhood? All of these are key considerations. Once you've sourced potential accommodations, compare them based on amenities, cost, and guest reviews. Amenities such as free Wi-Fi, business centers, fitness centers, and room service can make a substantial difference in the executive's comfort and productivity. If the executive is planning to entertain or hold meetings within the hotel, check for meeting space availability and catering options as well. Cost is another crucial factor. While it's important to ensure the executive's comfort, it's also necessary to consider the company's budget. Try negotiating rates with hotels, particularly if you're securing accommodation for an extended stay or multiple rooms. It's also recommended to read reviews from previous business travelers. They often provide valuable insights about the quality of service, convenience of the location, and other factors that matter to business travelers. You can find such reviews on numerous online platforms, some of which are specifically dedicated to business travel. Keep in mind that the ultimate goal is to provide a stress-free and positive experience for the executive. The ideal accommodations should allow them to rest comfortably, work efficiently, and access their work location and other required amenities without difficulty. It's also good if the accommodations provide a positive overall impression of the place they are visiting, as that can enhance the overall success of their business trip. Finally, once the accommodations are booked, ensure that all the details - including check-in/check-out times, transportation needs, and any special requests like dietary restrictions for the room service or early room preparation for incoming red-eye flights, are communicated to the hotel's front desk or concierge service prior to the executive's arrival. This step ensures that everything goes smoothly upon their arrival and throughout their stay. Overall, organizing executive accommodations is a multi-step process that requires thorough research, good judgment, and meticulous attention to detail."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The most familiar conservative forces are gravity, the electric force (in a time-independent magnetic field, see Faraday's law), and spring force. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: is the force of a spring a conservative force?","completion":"Yes, the force of a spring is a conservative force. A conservative force is a force that conserves mechanical energy in a system, meaning that the total mechanical energy remains constant as long as only conservative forces are acting upon the system. Mechanical energy includes both kinetic energy (the energy associated with an object's motion) and potential energy (the energy associated with an object's position in a force field or its composition). In the case of a spring, the force exerted by the spring is given by Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by the spring (F) is proportional to the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position (x). The proportionality constant, denoted as k, is called the spring constant and is a measure of the spring's stiffness. Mathematically, Hooke's Law is represented as: F = -k * x The negative sign indicates that the force exerted by the spring is always in the opposite direction of the displacement, which means the spring force is a restoring force – it tries to bring the spring back to its equilibrium position. When an object is attached to a spring and is displaced from its equilibrium position, the spring stores potential energy. This potential energy (U) in a spring can be represented by the following equation: U = (1/2) * k * x^2 As the object oscillates back and forth, the potential energy stored in the spring is converted into kinetic energy and vice versa, while the total mechanical energy remains constant. This conservation of mechanical energy is the key characteristic of a conservative force, including the force exerted by a spring. Therefore, the force of a spring is a conservative force because it conserves the total mechanical energy in the system. Throughout the oscillation, the energy transforms between potential and kinetic energy without any energy loss, provided that no non-conservative forces like friction or air resistance are acting upon the system. The nature of the spring force as a conservative force allows us to analyze and predict the behavior of mechanical systems, such as oscillators and mass-spring systems, using fundamental principles of conservation laws."},{"prompt":"This article: Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents.

British scientists have developed a robot which they are training to complete that very task. The robot - which they have named Boris - is the first to have enough intelligence to work out how to grip any single item put in front of it. Scroll down for video. A Birmingham University project has created a robot that can grab plates and cups. It can work out how to pick up different objects placed in front of it. Called 'Boris' (shown) it is controlled by three separate computers. While that is sufficient for most factory production, creating a robot which can pick up and manipulate any single item hugely increases its potential use for industry, surgery, or in the home. The development marks a huge step forward in robotics. Until now robots could only pick up items of a fixed size, placed in a fixed location. Boris - who was publicly unveiled at the British Science Festival in Birmingham today - is controlled by three different computers and has cost £350,000 (570,000) to build. Professor Jeremy Wyatt, the Birmingham University computing expert who led the project, said loading a dishwasher was his main goal. ‘The scenario that we've got is to get the robot to load a dishwasher,’ he said. ‘That's not because I think that dishwasher-loading robots are an economic, social necessity right now. It's because it encapsulates an incredibly hard range of general manipulation tasks. ‘Once you can crack that, once you can manipulate an object that you've never seen before, you can do a whole bunch of different things. ‘Loading a dishwasher is a really hard task.’ The Boris robot has been created by British scientists. Boris has thick multi-jointed arms that enable it to pick up objects. The robot can learn various grips and costs £350,000 (570,000) to build. Boris the robot's hands can learn the dexterity needed to pick up objects of different shapes and sizes. Boris performed in public for the first time in front of a festival audience yesterday. Safely confined to a basement laboratory, he reached out with a thick multi-jointed aluminium arm and picked up a measuring jug followed by a dustpan before depositing them in a tray. Significantly, Boris has been programmed to figure out different ways to handle each object, by curling round his fingers to use the whole hand, using the palm of the hand in a power-grip, or adopting a more delicate pinch-grip to grasp an edge. Boris is able to learn the different grips and adapt them to other unfamiliar objects without breaking or dropping them. ‘You've got all the freedom of having all these fingers, so now your brain has got to work really hard,’ said Prof Wyatt. ‘The robot comes up with about 1,000 different grasps in its head in about 10 seconds.’ Boris performed in public for the first time in front of a festival audience yesterday. Boris has been programmed to figure out different ways to handle each object, by curling round his fingers to use the whole hand, using the palm of the hand in a power-grip, or adopting a more delicate pinch-grip. He added: ‘It is fairly commonplace to programme robots to pick up particular objects and move them around - factory production lines are a good example of this. But when those objects vary in size or shape, robots tend to get clumsy. ‘The system we have developed allows the robot to assess the object and generate hundreds of different grasp options. That means the robot is able to make choices about the best grasp for the object it has been told to pick up, and it doesn't have to be re-trained each time the object changes.’ This could have major applications in industry. The project, called Pacman, has been carried out in collaboration with the universities of Pisa in Italy and Innsbruck in Austria, and is funded by the European Commission. The team has already patented the technology, and is working with a firm in Coventry to develop a version of Boris that co-operates with humans on the factory floor. Boris is able to learn the different grips and adapt them to other unfamiliar objects without breaking them. Professor Jeremy Wyatt, the Birmingham University computing expert who led the project, said loading a dishwasher was his main goal. ‘It might be five or 10 years in the future, but you're going to have robots working with humans, and that means they're going to have to cope with all the uncertainty that humans introduce into the environment,’ he said. ‘One of the really big problems on robot assembly lines is if you want to change the part shapes. At the moment, when the world changes, the whole system breaks down. You want to be able to change the parts on short runs very, very quickly.’ A lot more work is needed before a new generation of Boris robots is sent into the real world. The next big step for the scientists is to get Boris to use both his arms and transfer objects from one hand to another. ‘Being bi-manual is a real advantage for all sorts of purposes,’ said Prof Wyatt, who hopes to see the robot stacking plates by next April.

[-] potato chips and other sweets..","completion":"They bought them candies instead of potato chips, because they love the candies and other sweets. This decision was influenced by a few factors that show their preference for candies over potato chips, as well as the benefits of choosing sweets in specific situations. Here is a detailed explanation of why they opted for candies instead of potato chips. Firstly, it's essential to understand the individuals' taste preferences. Candies and other sweets are usually more appealing to people with a sweet tooth than salty snacks like potato chips. There is something satisfying about the syrupy, sugary, and sometimes even fruity flavors in candies that satiate the cravings of those who have an undeniable fondness for sweets. This could be a significant reason why they chose candies over potato chips as they were catering to their inclination towards sweet treats. Secondly, candies offer a more versatile range of flavors and textures, which may have contributed to choosing them over potato chips. While potato chips primarily deliver a crispy and salty experience, candies come in various forms, such as gummies, hard candies, chocolates, and caramels. This assortment plays a vital role in satisfying diverse palates, making them a more attractive option for those who enjoy exploring different tastes and textures. Another possible reason for choosing candies over potato chips is the nostalgic factor. Candies often remind people of their childhood memories, which brings a sense of comfort and happiness. It is not uncommon for individuals to associate sweet treats with special occasions, parties, or rewards from their younger years. On the other hand, potato chips might not evoke the same cherished emotions in people. By opting for candies, they might be attempting to relive some fond memories and feelings connected to these confections. Furthermore, candies may be better suited to specific occasions or situations. For instance, if they were selecting treats to incorporate into a gift basket or share during a party, candies might be considered a better alternative. They are visually appealing, individually wrapped, and can be easily portioned, which makes them suitable for gifting purposes or sharing among a group of people. In contrast, potato chips might be a less appealing gift, harder to divide equally, and could get crushed easily during transportation. Lastly, it's essential to consider potential health-related reasons for selecting candies over potato chips. Although candies may contain high sugar content, they can still be consumed in moderation. They might not contain unhealthy fats and the preservatives commonly found in some potato chips. Some candy varieties contain healthier ingredients like dark chocolate, which is rich in antioxidants. Therefore, candies could be viewed as a slightly healthier option compared to potato chips, depending on the person's dietary requirements. In conclusion, they chose to buy candies instead of potato chips because they love the candies and other sweets for their versatile range of flavors, nostalgic connections, adaptability to specific occasions, and possible health-related factors. It becomes evident that their choice was driven by the desire to cater to taste preferences, satisfy their cravings, and uphold cherished memories associated with candies from their past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Uncertainty over the fate of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was further compounded Saturday by reports that two men whose names matched those on the passenger manifest had reported their passports stolen. Malaysian authorities apparently did not check the stolen documents on an international law enforcement agency database, CNN has learned. After the airline released a manifest of the 239 people on the plane, Austria denied that one of its citizens was on the flight as the list had stated. The Austrian citizen was safe and sound, and his passport had been stolen two years ago, Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Weiss said. Similarly, Italy's foreign ministry confirmed that no Italians were on the flight, even though an Italian was listed on the manifest. Malaysian officials said they were aware of reports that the Italian's passport was also stolen but had not confirmed it. On Saturday, Italian police visited the home of the parents of Luigi Maraldi, the man whose name appeared on the manifest, to inform them about the missing flight, said a police official in Cesena, in northern Italy. Maraldi's father, Walter, told police that he had just spoken to his son, who was fine and not on the missing flight, said the official, who is not authorized to speak to the media. Maraldi was vacationing in Thailand, his father said. The police official said that Maraldi had reported his passport stolen in Malaysia last August and had obtained a new one.

Born in Drouin to Alfred and Colleen Ablett, Gary Ablett grew up in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria's Gippsland region alongside his four elder brothers and three sisters. Ablett displayed a love for sport at an early age, winning the state school high jump at 10 years of age. He was also awarded both club and competition best and fairest awards for Drouin at the under-11s, under-12s and under-14s levels. After citing waning interest in school, Ablett dropped out of high school at the age of 15 years to become a bricklayer's labourer. Two of Ablett's brothers played in the Victorian Football League - Kevin Ablett, who played for Hawthorn, Richmond and Geelong, and Geoff Ablett, who played for Hawthorn, Richmond and St Kilda. Ablett's eldest son, Gary Ablett Jr., has followed in his footsteps to play for Geelong. In 2007 and 2009, Ablett Jr. won the Cats' best and fairest award, emulating a feat established by his father in his first season with the Cats back in 1984; he also won the Brownlow Medal in 2009 and 2013. Another son, Nathan, was drafted in 2004 (48th pick) by Geelong under the father-son rule. Nathan initially refused to play AFL Football because of his father's experience with the media, but, with encouragement from the club, was signed ahead of the 2005 AFL Season and has since established himself in the full forward role Gary Snr made his own. On 29 September 2007, both Gary Jr. and Nathan contributed to Geelong winning its first flag in 44 years, capturing the premiership that proved elusive to Gary Snr in his 12 years at the club. Nathan retired suddenly before the 2008 season, but he and his brother Gary Jr. were members of the Gold Coast Football Club's inaugural team for the 2011 season. In addition to his sons, Ablett has a nephew, Luke Ablett, who played for the Sydney Swans and won a premiership with them in 2005. Two other nephews, from his sister's marriage to Hawthorn legend Michael Tuck, also played in the AFL - Richmond's Shane Tuck and Travis Tuck, who played for Hawthorn.

Context: It’s always interesting to read back on why people do things, especially people who end up making a career or a fortune out of the seemingly benign choices they make. Thelma Schoonmaker, the film editor whom my previous post was about was one of those people; she got into editing after seeing an ad in the New York Times. I’m in no way suggesting I’m going to make a fortune, nor that I’m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices. Art blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I’m not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to. I’d always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas. The next thing I knew I had started an art blog aptly titled: Artistic Expansion and I began spending hours a day searching through the internet for content, often finding my best pieces in the most random places, often not even defined intentionally as ‘art’. Over the last two years I must have blogged hundreds of multi-coloured, multi-textured and multi-layered images, accumulated over 2000 followers and consumed more art than I ever had in my entire life. I find it interesting not because of it’s success, but because before I started my art blog, I really had no idea how much I did or could love art and once I had made my art blog I couldn’t imagine how I ever functioned without it.

News article: A much-anticipated meeting between the US president Barack Obama and the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani did not happen on Tuesday, according to White House officials. There had been speculation that the pair would meet on the fringes of the United Nations general assembly in New York, in what would have been the first such encounter since the Islamic revolution toppled the shah of Iran in 1979. But Obama administration officials said that while the US offered a meeting, the Iranian delegation turned it down, saying it was \\"too complicated\\". Officials from the two countries have been discussing the logistics of an \\"encounter\\" in the UN complex in mid-town Manhattan for several days, a UN official confirmed to the press pool travelling with Obama. In the end though, the official said, it was \\"too complicated for Iranians to do at this point\\". Theres was no immediate statement from the Iranian delegation. But Press TV, Tehran's English-language television station, gave alcohol as the reason that Rouhani had missed one possible venue for a handshake or a few shared words, the lunch traditionally hosted by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon on the opening day of the general assembly. When guests gathered in the delegates lounge of the UN building, they were seated at tables upon which white and red wine were served – a facility that proved too much for the Muslim theologian Rouhani. The White House said that a meeting would go ahead on Thursday between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, his Iranian counterpart and other foreign ministers from the other permanent security council members, plus Germany. That meeting is intended to address reviving negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday warned that the world \\"should not be fooled\\" by signs of moderation by Rouhani and must keep up the pressure on Tehran. \\"Iran thinks soothing words and token actions will enable it to continue on its path to the bomb,\\" Netanyahu said. In his UN speech, Obama said he had assigned Kerry to oversee negotiations with Tehran. In the past those talks had been led by a succession of State Department diplomats, and critics had complained there was no one in the administration who was in charge of US-Iran policy. He also offered Rouhani an important symbolic gesture, making the first official US acknowledgement of the CIA's well-documented role in the ousting of Iran's democratically-elected government in 1953. \\"This mistrust has deep roots. Iranians have long complained of a history of US interference in their affairs, and America's role in overthrowing an Iranian government during the cold war,\\" Obama said. The reference to the CIA's part in the ousting of Mohammad Mosaddegh, Iran's democratically elected leader, marked a first official admission of that role, and represented an important gesture to Rouhani. It will be seen in Iran as a diplomatic victory and belated acknowledgement of a long-festering Iranian sense of injustice. The coup, support by both the US and the UK, paved the way for the dictatorship of the shah, and then the 1979 Islamic revolution against it. \\"I don't believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight. The suspicions run too deep. But I do believe if we can resolve the issue of Iran's nuclear programme that can be a major step,\\" Obama said. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaks during an interview with state television at the presidency in Tehran, Iran. Photograph: Rouzbeh Jadidoleslam/AP The abortive attempt to arrange a meeting between Obama and Rouhani was an echo of a similar incident in 2000 when it was expected that the two leaders at the time, Bill Clinton and Mohammad Khatami, would break the ice in the frozen relationship with the same kind of \\"chance encounter\\", but Khatami pulled out at the last moment. The Iranian skittishness on both occasions reflected the delicate stand-off between hawks and doves in Tehran. Moderate leaders like Rouhani and Khatami have to choose their battles carefully and not give hostages to fortunes. Being pictured with an American president without being able to deliver real diplomatic or economic gains for Iran could be cast as weakness or even betrayal if the political winds in Iran change once again. \\"The Iranians have an internal dynamic that they have to manage and the relationship with the United States is clearly quite different than the relationship that Iran has with other Western nations,\\" a senior administration official told reporters. The last few encounters between US and Iranian officials have been brief affairs. The last one was in the Hague at a conference on Afghanistan where the late American special envoy Richard Holbrooke had a \\"cordial\\" chat with an Iranian deputy foreign minister in 2009. The choreography of diplomatic handshakes at UN gatherings in New York has a long history; getting it wrong can have painful consequences. In 2004 the then British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, got into hot water after he shook the hands of the Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, at a UN reception in New York; Straw later claimed he had made the gesture by mistake in the dark. ||||| TEHRAN — This is Hassan Rouhani’s moment. The toast of the United Nations, the new Iranian president is busy granting interviews to select audiences and possibly cramming in a meeting with President Obama — the first such high-level get-together since the 1979 revolution. But when he stands before the world to speak on Tuesday, he will do so as the loyal representative of Iran’s supreme leader, the ultimate authority behind the country’s recent diplomatic charm offensive. Since his election in June, Mr. Rouhani has made no secret of his wish to reach an accord with the West on Iran’s nuclear program — and no secret that the only reason he can reach out so conspicuously is that he has the support, for now anyway, of one man, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader. “Rouhani can only attempt to have direct talks because the supreme leader has agreed to it; otherwise, Rouhani would not be in New York now,” said Hamid-Reza Taraghi, an insider who is one of the few people trusted to interpret for the public the supreme leader’s sermons and speeches. “The president and his team enter any talks only under the leader’s direct command.” An enigmatic and cunning man, Ayatollah Khamenei, 74, is the one who gave Mr. Rouhani the authority to pursue a deal with the United States, top aides to Mr. Rouhani and outside experts say, and could just as easily cut off support — as he has done to some Iranian leaders before, including Mr. Rouhani. Ayatollah Khamenei sees himself as a sort of referee of Iran’s complex political system, sitting in judgment of the politicians he anoints to lead the country in what are often sharply different directions. In 1997, for example, he blessed the reformist candidacy of Mohammad Khatami, who relaxed some social restrictions and allowed more press freedom. But he allowed the hard-liners to undermine Mr. Khatami’s presidency, and in 2005 he pinwheeled to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the strident nationalist hard-liner, who denied the Holocaust and antagonized the West for much of his eight years in office. This year, in a surprise to almost all Iran watchers, Ayatollah Khamenei has seemed to get behind Mr. Rouhani’s diplomatic push, talking in somewhat opaque but nevertheless conciliatory terms of “heroic flexibility.” And on Monday, in another gesture of support for Mr. Rouhani, Iran released 80 political prisoners. But the question for many here is, how much room will the supreme leader allow for diplomacy before pulling the rug out from under Mr. Rouhani? This is not the first go-round for Ayatollah Khamenei and Mr. Rouhani, himself something of a prodigy who was once the darling of the clerics who founded the Islamic republic. In 2003 Mr. Rouhani, then the chief nuclear negotiator, persuaded Ayatollah Khamenei to suspend uranium enrichment for several months in hopes of reaching a nuclear deal. But the negotiations broke down, and Mr. Rouhani was banished from the circles of power before being resurrected this spring. From Ayatollah Khamenei’s perspective, experts say, it makes perfect sense to stand back and allow Mr. Rouhani to conduct talks with the country’s main adversary. “Everybody understands that Supreme Leader Khamenei is in a win-win situation,” said Mojtaba Mousavi, an Iranian political commentator who is often briefed by officials close to the leader. He explained that if talks lead to the reduction or elimination of the economic sanctions that have damaged Iran’s economy, Ayatollah Khamenei will get the credit for approving the new negotiating strategy. But Ayatollah Khamenei can also take the credit if the talks should collapse. “If talks fail to reach any results, he will be praised for having proved his warnings over the dishonesty by the West towards Iran,” said Mr. Mousavi. “In that case his doubts will be proved once again.” Experts here say that Ayatollah Khamenei, who was appointed supreme leader in 1989, is interested in testing the flexibility of the United States in negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, which it says is for peaceful uses but the West says is a cover for developing nuclear weapons. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A meeting between President Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani did not take place as anticipated on Tuesday at the United Nations general assembly in New York.

Summarize the following: In addition to benefits like weight loss, exercise has also been linked to fewer depressive symptoms and a lowered risk of heart disease. This means that keeping a regular exercise routine will keep you feeling uplifted, energized, and secure in your good health. If you find it difficult to find the motivation to begin, try starting small by adding brisk walks to your week. Then, you can gradually increase the amount of cardiovascular or strength training exercise to the degree that your lifestyle permits. Try to exercise in ways that increase your flexibility. This way you will learn to see your body as something that is always evolving and changing. Do you ever have those unbearably happy mornings? The type where you find yourself smiling at everyone on an early grocery run, for example? These experiences may actually change how you see yourself and how others see you, too. Compared to people who are not smiling, folks who tend to show their pearly whites more often are considered by others to be more sincere, social, and even competent. Even if you don't feel like it. It'll make you feel and look a lot happier! Remember that taking good care of your teeth is a great way to increase confidence in your smile. Brush and floss regularly, and reduce your risk of tooth decay by rinsing your mouth out after eating or drinking sugary foods. Spend as much time as possible doing things that let you see how talented and capable you are. A feeling of accomplishment is part of what creates the sort of beauty that emanates from within. This may seem obvious, but sometimes the things we're truly good at can slip away from us if a job or school responsibilities ask that we diverge from our talents. For example, if writing is your forte, craft poems and prose in your spare time. If you're brilliant at sports, join a team that plays on the weekends so that you'll always get your healthy dose of competition. Remember that healthy eating is not the same as going on a diet. Diets tend to be temporary and unsustainable in the long run. Eating well requires habits like introducing more fresh veggies, fruits, and whole grains to your shopping list, and cooking with a good degree of variety. If you're big on foods with lots of fat, sugar, and salt, consider cutting back significantly. Because balance is key, treating yourself is also a part of eating well. If you're tempted by the occasional ice cream cone or pastry, don't deny yourself outright--this is where moderation comes in. Treating yourself will help you remember that how you treat yourself is a big part of the self-confidence that makes you radiant. When you are at ease, people will respond positively, making you feel attractive and present to others. Think about it--when you see someone who looks comfortable in her skin, you can't help but want to be a part of that relaxed way of being. The following are helpful practices that will slowly lower the amount of tension you habitually carry in your body: Progressive muscle relaxation Yoga Intentional breathing If you feel physically uncomfortable in what you’re wearing, you will begin to develop an oppositional relationship to your body; in other words, a negative body image. Forcing yourself into clothes that don't fit well will make you see your body as too large or too small to wear what you want to wear. Especially for women, wearing well-fitting clothing can change your perception of yourself for the better, increasing your confidence related to emotional management, social skills, and work-related tasks.","completion":"Exercise offers numerous benefits, including weight loss, reduced depressive symptoms, and lowered risk of heart disease, leading to improved overall well-being. A regular exercise routine and maintaining flexibility can have a positive impact on mental and physical health. Smiling more often can make you appear more sincere, social, and competent to others, while good dental care boosts smile confidence. Pursue activities that highlight your talents and capabilities to foster inner beauty.

Большая соленая черта земли с течением времени постепенно погружается, и это процесс усугубляется из-за жаркого климата региона. Соленые отложения, которые образуются в таких районах, как Лас-Кумарагуас, являются результатом испарения соленых вод из источников и ветреной переноски соли на большие расстояния. При этом воздействие сильной жары на соленые отложения вызывает процесс их сжатия и последующего опускания на различных участках. Подобные явления могут привести к экологическим последствиям и изменениям в ландшафте, таким как постепенное уменьшение соленых озер, образование грунтовых трещин и искажения в выпуклостях земной поверхности.

Although naming a child after oneself can be seen as a bit egocentric, I believe that it can also be a way of carrying on a family legacy. Lauren was initially hesitant about naming their son after Simon, as she thought it might be confusing to have two Simons in the house. However, after discussing the matter at length, they both agreed that they loved the name and wanted their son to have a connection to his father's name. Additionally, both Simon and Lauren believe that having Simon as their son's first name will instill a sense of self-esteem and pride in him as he grows up, knowing that he carries the name of someone who has achieved great success in the world of entertainment. Moreover, giving their son the middle name Eric, after Simon's father, is a meaningful gesture to honor the late Eric Cowell, who had passed away in 1999. This decision demonstrates the importance of family values to the couple and highlights their desire to include significant family members in their son's upbringing and identity. As their baby will be born in New York, Simon and Lauren also wanted to take into consideration the location of their son's birth when deciding on his name. New York City is a melting pot of diverse cultures and backgrounds, and choosing a name that captures the essence of this vibrant city is essential.

However, they are not identical, as the first sentence gives additional information about the specific types of drinks being referred to. To thoroughly analyze their similarity, let's break down each sentence: Sentence 1: \\"Got some Heine and coors light i started it last night xanis.\\" This sentence has two main parts: 1. The mention of specific drinks (Heine and Coors Light) - This is additional information that the second sentence lacks. 2. The action of starting something (it) last night - This part is present in both sentences and can also be linked to 'xanis' in both sentences, which might represent the name of an event, social gathering, or person. Sentence 2: \\"i started it last night xanis.\\" This sentence focuses solely on the action of starting something last night and connects it to 'xanis' as well. Based on our analysis, the similarity of these two sentences lies in the action (starting something last night connected to 'xanis') however, they are not identical due to the additional information in the first sentence. So, on a scale of 0 (not similar at all) to 5 (means the same thing), I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as 3. This is because they share a core aspect (starting something related to 'xanis' last night), but still differ in terms of specifying the drinks involved in the first sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery in the forest behind the Creeds' new home. On his first day at work, Louis meets Victor Pascow, a jogger who is brought in with severe injuries from a car accident. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. After he dies, Pascow comes to Louis in the night and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat Church is run down on the highway in front of the house. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an abandoned Micmac burial ground. Without explanation Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day Church comes back to life, though a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground as a boy, and that although the cat might be different it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway.

Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death.

These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of peninsular India (outside of Tamilakam) interfaced between the increasing use of the local Kannada language and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, including those that were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit. Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land. The local language formed the desi (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more marga (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning (ghatikas) taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the devotional movements of later centuries.Contemporaneous literature and inscriptions show that Kannada was not only popular in the modern Karnataka region but had spread further north into present day southern Maharashtra and to the northern Deccan by the 8th century. Kavirajamarga, the work on poetics, refers to the entire region between the Kaveri River and the Godavari River as \\"Kannada country\\". Higher education in Sanskrit included the subjects of Veda, Vyakarana (grammar), Jyotisha (astronomy and astrology), Sahitya (literature), Mimansa (Exegesis), Dharmashastra (law), Puranas (ritual), and Nyaya (logic). An examination of inscriptions from this period shows that the Kavya (classical) style of writing was popular. The awareness of the merits and defects in inscriptions by the archivists indicates that even they, though mediocre poets, had studied standard classical literature in Sanskrit.

Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.)

Sentence 1: \\"The real basis of the flower is that lenses can never focus perfectly in the physical world.\\" In this sentence, the main subject is \\"the real basis of the flower.\\" It suggests that there is a fundamental reason underlying the concept of a \\"flower\\" being discussed.

Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". Q: Rivers flowing over gentle slopes move more slowly. They move much more slowly than a mountain stream. These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river.

Bragg asked Roy Wood Sellars to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the Humanist Manifesto in 1933. Potter's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism, the latter declaring a new religion by saying, \\"any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age. To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present.\\" It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion.\\" Answer:","completion":"The Humanist Manifesto, published in 1933, was based on the collective input of prominent figures such as Raymond B. Bragg, Leon Milton Birkhead, Charles Francis Potter, members of the Western Unitarian Conference, and others interested in promoting a modern, non-theistic and ethical worldview. The drafting of the document was entrusted to Roy Wood Sellars, who synthesized the ideas and values of these contributors to create the Humanist Manifesto. The Manifesto aimed to establish a new religion relevant to the contemporary world, emphasizing the importance of adapting religious principles according to the needs of each age. The Manifesto identified and presented 15 theses, which served as foundational principles for modern humanism. These theses touched on various aspects of humanist values, including reason, ethics, science, and social progress. The key elements of the Humanist Manifesto included: 1. A rejection of traditional theism and supernaturalism in favor of a naturalistic worldview. 2. Emphasis on the importance of reason, scientific inquiry, and critical thinking in shaping human understanding and ethical values. 3. Affirming the inherent worth and dignity of every human being, regardless of their beliefs or background. 4. Encouraging cultural and intellectual diversity, along with the importance of individual freedom and civil liberties. 5. The development of ethical values based on human experience and needs, rather than divine authority or sacred texts. 6. A belief in human responsibility for solving global problems and promoting progress through education, social justice, and ethical behavior. 7. Emphasis on the interconnectedness of human society, promoting cooperation and a global ethic in addressing common challenges. Potter's book and the Humanist Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism, providing a foundation for secular ethics and the promotion of human well-being over supernatural belief. The Humanist Manifesto has since been revised and updated, most notably with the Humanist Manifesto II published in 1973 and the Humanism and Its Aspirations published in 2003, reflecting the ongoing evolution of humanist thought in response to changing social, cultural, and intellectual contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The sentence you provided translates to English as: \\"It was created as a painting that needs to be viewed from a static position.\\" In providing a more detailed explanation, the sentence seems to suggest a piece of work made with a specific viewing method in mind; this work is likened to a painting which has to be appreciated from a stationary angle. This implies that the best way to fully absorb and appreciate the magnitude and details of the work (possibly an artwork, sculpture, or any form of display) is by examining it from a particular or fixed perspective. It entails that the observer should not alter their viewing angle in order to sufficiently grasp the purpose and aesthetic value the creator intended. Similar to observing a painting in a museum, we often have to position ourselves at an appropriate distance and angle to see and comprehend the whole picture. Our evaluation often becomes reliant on the static nature of our viewpoint, which allows us to focus on the details and uncover multiple layers of interpretation. Therefore, this sentence beautifully captures the idea of patience and careful examination in appreciating art or any detailed work, asserting the necessity of a stationary, uninterrupted perspective over a hurried, variable one. Moreover, it also comments subtly on the importance of the creator's intention in influencing the viewer's perspective, relating to the broader concept of subjective versus objective understanding in art appreciation. It emphasizes the value of the individual's experience in interpreting artistic intention, with the condition set by the creator of the artwork – viewing from a static position in this case – possibly guiding or even limiting that interpretation. In the wider context, this statement could also be used metaphorically to represent a belief, opinion, or viewpoint that should be examined from a fixed perspective to be truly understood and valued. It could symbolize the notion that certain situations should be analyzed or viewed from the same position in which they originally unfolded, without altering the perception or the context."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Theknownriskfactorsforperipheralarterydiseasearethosethatpredisposetothedevelopmentofatherosclerosis.","completion":"The known risk factors for peripheral artery disease are those that predispose to the development of atherosclerosis. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the limbs, usually the legs. This occurs mainly due to the buildup of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) on the artery walls. PAD can cause leg pain during activities like walking or climbing stairs, known as intermittent claudication. Additionally, it can lead to more severe complications if not treated timely, such as leg ulcers, gangrene, and limb amputation. Atherosclerosis, the primary underlying cause of PAD, occurs when fatty deposits, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances accumulate in the artery walls, leading to the formation of plaques. These plaques can narrow the lumen of the arteries, causing blood flow reduction to the limbs. Several known risk factors predispose individuals to the development of atherosclerosis and subsequently, peripheral artery disease. These include: 1. Age: The risk of developing PAD increases with age. It is more common in individuals over 60 years old. 2. Smoking: Smoking damages blood vessels and contributes to the accumulation of plaque in the arteries. This increases the risk of developing PAD, and the risk is further heightened with long-term smoking. 3. Diabetes: High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels and promote plaque formation, increasing the risk of developing PAD. Diabetic patients are more likely to suffer from peripheral artery disease. 4. High blood pressure: Elevated blood pressure can put extra stress on the artery walls, making them more prone to plaque buildup and hardening. This increases the risk of atherosclerosis and PAD. 5. High cholesterol: High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increase plaque formation in the arteries. Elevated levels of triglycerides, another type of blood fat, can contribute to the risk of atherosclerosis as well. 6. Obesity: Being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing PAD, as excess body fat can cause inflammation and damage blood vessels, leading to atherosclerosis. 7. Lack of physical activity: A sedentary lifestyle contributes to many health issues, including obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels, all of which increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and PAD. 8. Family history: A history of PAD or cardiovascular disease in close family members may suggest a genetic predisposition to atherosclerosis and increase the risk of developing peripheral artery disease. 9. Ethnicity: African American and Hispanic populations seem to have a higher prevalence of PAD compared to Caucasian populations, likely due to a mix of genetic and environmental factors. By recognizing and addressing these risk factors, individuals can work towards reducing their risk of developing peripheral artery disease. Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, controlling diabetes and blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular physical activity, and managing high cholesterol levels through diet and medications can significantly reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, ultimately preventing the onset of peripheral artery disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make this lower case.","completion":"chances of a stable night’s sleep at this age are increased if the child can fall asleep in their own room. Here are some additional tips to help a child achieve a stable night's sleep in their own room: 1. Establish a consistent bedtime routine: Following a set routine every night can signal to the child that it's time to wind down and get ready for sleep. A bedtime routine might include activities such as taking a warm bath, reading a bedtime story, or listening to calming music. 2. Create a sleep-friendly environment: A child's bedroom should be conducive to sleep. This includes keeping the room cool, dark, and quiet, as well as providing a comfortable and supportive mattress and pillow. You can also use blackout curtains, a white noise machine, or a fan to minimize external disturbances. 3. Encourage the child to self-soothe: Teaching a child how to settle themselves back to sleep when they wake up during the night can help promote a more stable night's sleep. You can do this by providing a comfort object, such as a soft blanket or stuffed animal, that they can hold onto while they fall asleep. 4. Limit screen time before bed: Exposure to electronic devices that emit blue light can interfere with a child's natural sleep cycle. To avoid this, make sure to have a screen-free period of at least one hour before bedtime. 5. Avoid overstimulation before bedtime: To help a child wind down before bed, avoid engaging them in overly exciting or stimulating activities. Instead, opt for calming activities that can help them relax. 6. Be patient and consistent: Adjusting to a new sleep routine can take time, and it's essential to remain patient and consistent. Encourage your child's progress and reassure them if they experience difficulties falling asleep. Over time, you'll likely see improvement in their ability to fall (and stay) asleep in their own room. 7. Address any fears or anxieties: Sometimes children may have fears or anxieties that prevent them from sleeping in their own room. It's important to address these concerns calmly and reassure them that there is nothing to be afraid of. Provide comfort and support as needed until they feel safe and comfortable in their own space. By implementing these strategies, you can help your child feel more comfortable in their own room and increase the chances of a stable night's sleep at this age."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. Question: \\"Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest but by who bringing it to the east coast?\\" Answer: \\"Sri Maharaja\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, the answer is not correct.

Here is a goal: wash cloth Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of washing a cloth, I suggest the following step-by-step method which makes more sense: 1. Prepare the materials: Gather a basin or sink, mild detergent or soap, warm water, and a soft brush or sponge. This step helps in ensuring that you have everything you need to properly wash the cloth. 2. Fill the basin or sink with warm water: Warm water is effective in removing dirt and stains, as well as being gentle on most types of fabrics. 3. Add a small amount of mild detergent or soap: A mild detergent is less likely to damage the fabric or cause color fading, while still providing a thorough cleaning. 4. Mix the soap and water: Swirling your hand or sponge in the water helps in dissolving the soap/detergent and creating suds or bubbles that are essential for cleaning. 5. Submerge the cloth in the soapy water: Fully submerging the cloth ensures that all areas of the fabric receive adequate cleaning. 6. Gently agitate the cloth: Use your hands or a soft brush/sponge to gently rub the fabric in a back-and-forth motion or in small circular motions, focusing on any stains or heavily soiled areas. This step helps in loosening dirt and debris from the cloth fibers. 7. Let the cloth soak for a few minutes: Allowing the cloth to soak in the soapy water helps in further breaking down dirt and stains, making them easier to remove. 8. Rinse the cloth: Remove the cloth from the soapy water and hold it under clean running water or submerge it in a separate basin of clean water to remove soap residues. Repeat this process until all soap has been washed away. 9. Gently wring out excess water from the cloth: This step helps in speeding up the drying process and prevents water from dripping on surfaces. 10. Lay the cloth out to dry: Find a clean and flat surface, such as a drying rack or clothesline, and lay the cloth flat or hang it up, allowing it to air dry. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can cause fading or damage to some fabrics. This method ensures a thorough and gentle cleaning for the cloth while preserving its quality and appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However his campaign is damaged by the revelation of his affair with one of his supporters, when Cam accidentally leaves a sexually explicit voice message on a local family's answering machine. The corrupt businessmen brothers Glenn and Wade Motch (Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow) use this opportunity to convince Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), tourism director for the town of Hammond and son of one of their associates, Raymond Huggins, to run against Cam on the Republican ticket, as part of a plan to profit from dealings with a Chinese company. Cam at first underestimates Marty and humiliates him by playing a video biography highlighting potentially embarrassing aspects of Marty's life. The Motch brothers then hire Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott) to be Marty's campaign manager. Tim reinvents Marty as a successful entrepreneur and family man. Marty's popularity rises due to his effective campaign while Cam's is further damaged when he accidentally punches a baby when intending to hit Marty. Cam later runs a campaign portraying Marty as an Al Qaeda terrorist, and Marty exposes Cam as a fake Christian by asking him to recite the Lord's Prayer, which he fails to do.

Background: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier. Paragraph: Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"Write a letter to the person about acceptance and forgiveness. Suggest spending quality time with the person. Be prepared if any issues or problems arise between you and the person again.\\"","completion":"Title: The Art of Acceptance and Forgiveness: Strengthening Bonds through Quality Time Introduction In our journey of life, we often encounter situations when misunderstandings and conflicts lead to emotional turmoil and distances between loved ones. Acceptance and forgiveness play a crucial role in bridging the gap, restoring harmony, and fostering healthy and nurturing relationships. Writing a heartfelt letter to the person affected can not only help alleviate the burden of unresolved emotions but also provide an opportunity to spend quality time together and help them cope with the challenges that life presents. Embracing Acceptance: A Sign of Emotional Maturity Acceptance is the ability to recognize the reality of a situation and come to terms with it, without attempting to change or control it. When we practice acceptance, we cultivate an attitude of understanding, empathy, and tolerance, making it easier to endure difficult situations. In your letter, acknowledge the differences and conflicts that may have occurred, admitting your own shortcomings and expressing your willingness to accept the person as they are. Forgiveness, the Path to Inner Peace and Stronger Relationships Holding on to resentment, anger, and grudges only increases our emotional baggage and leads to bitterness, preventing us from nurturing a healthy relationship. Forgiveness is an act of kindness and love – not just towards others but also oneself. As you write the letter, emphasize the importance of forgiveness and express the desire to let go of the past. Share how forgiveness would enable both of you to learn and grow, leading to a more balanced life and a stronger bond. Reconnecting through Quality Time Suggesting to spend quality time together is a step forward in rebuilding trust and strengthening connections. Quality time refers to the moments we dedicate to giving our undivided attention, actively engaging, and valuing the presence of another. In the letter, propose different activities that both of you could indulge in, like taking a walk in the park, having deep conversations, playing games, or even cooking a meal together. By doing so, you present an opportunity to overcome any awkwardness and establish a sense of camaraderie. Preparing for Future Challenges Despite our best intentions, life’s unpredictability may throw challenges that can cause conflicts or misunderstandings. While assuring your support to the person, be prepared to face any future issues with honesty, patience, and open-mindedness. As you write the letter, encourage them to believe in the power of resilience, acceptance, and forgiveness, which lay the foundation for an unwavering bond. A healthy relationship thrives when both parties willingly work through adversity, keeping the lines of communication open, and appreciating each other's perspectives. Conclusion In this era of digital communication, the value of a hand-written letter might seem outdated. However, it remains an intimate, personal, and touching method of expressing one's emotions and thoughts. By writing a letter focused on acceptance, forgiveness, and the desire to create meaningful memories, you invite the person to share a renewed connection. As you take this significant step towards healing past wounds, you reinforce the resilience of the human spirit and the potential of love and understanding to triumph over adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although not high royalty, on the occasion of their marriage, they styled themselves Prince and Princesse respectively. Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eye witness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\"Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions. This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Musée Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion. Ingres signed and dated the final picture at the left center \\"J. INGRES. pit 1853\\".Pauline died in 1860 aged 35 from tuberculosis.

Levine’s ninth tweet was the one which drew widespread interest, and it read:Soon we’ll start “temporary interment”. This likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials (yes you read that right). Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line. It will be done in a dignified, orderly–and temporary–manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take. 9/Levine’s thread began with the first transcribed tweet below, and the preceding seven to eight tweets led up to the “temporary internment” portion:NYC’s healthcare system is being pushed to the limit. And sadly, now so is the city’s system for managing our dead. And it, too, needs more resources. This has big implications for grieving families. And for all of us. 1/NYC’s “city morgue” is the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), which luckily is the best in the world. But they are now dealing w/ the equivalent of an ongoing 9/11. And so are hospital morgues, funeral homes & cemeteries. Every part of this system is now backed up. 2/A typical hospital morgue might hold 15 bodies. Those are now all full. So OCME has sent out 80 refrigerated trailers to hospitals around the city. Each trailer can hold 100 bodies. These are now mostly full too. Some hospitals have had to add a 2nd or even a 3rd trailer. 3/Grieving families report calling as many as half a dozen funeral homes and finding none that can handle their deceased loved ones. Cemeteries are not able to handle the number of burial requests and are turning most down. 4/It’s not just deaths in hospitals which are up. On an average day before this crisis there were 20-25 deaths at home in NYC. Now in the midst of this pandemic the number is 200-215. *Every day*. 5/Early on in this crisis we were able to swab people who died at home, and thus got a coronavirus reading. But those days are long gone. We simply don’t have the testing capacity for the large numbers dying at home. 6/Now only those few who had a test confirmation *before* dying are marked as victims of coronavirus on their death certificate. This almost certainly means we are undercounting the total number of victims of this pandemic. 7/And still the number of bodies continues to increase. The freezers at OCME facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn will soon be full. And then what? 8/Levine continued, concluding with a “recap” tweet:To recap: Nothing matters more in this crisis than saving the living. But we need to face the gruesome reality that we need more resources to manage our dead as well. Or the pain of this crisis will be compounded almost beyond comprehension. 13/13Naturally, Levine’s stark descriptions — particularly of “temporary internment” and mass graves in city parks (like Central Park) generated tremendous interest. That claim proved an eerie follow-up to an unrelated March 27 2020 viral tweet about the semantics (“temporary”) of mass graves:We are, at most, like 10 days away from semantic arguments about what qualifies as a \\"\\"mass\\"\\" grave.— Mass for Shut-ins (is a podcast) (@edburmila) March 27, 2020Incidentally, the “arguing about the semantics of mass graves” tweet was published on March 27 2020. Levine’s tweets were dated April 6 2020. That is, in fact, a difference of ten days:Two hours after the first Twitter thread, Levine clarified with a follow-up tweet in which he explained that the temporary mass graves were part of New York City’s contingency plans. He also said they would only be considered if the infection rates for COVID-19 kept climbing:This tweet has gotten a lot of attention. So I want to clarify: the is a contingency NYC is preparing for BUT if the death rate drops enough it will not be necessary. https://t.co/6wLO8qWtML— Mark D. Levine (@MarkLevineNYC) April 6, 2020According to the New York Times, New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio acknowledged the existence of such contingency plans, adding that the use of temporary mass graves was “under consideration” but not in place:Mayor Bill de Blasio said on [April 6 2020] that no such plan had been put in place yet, though he acknowledged it was under consideration.“If we need to do temporary burials to be able to tide us over to pass the crisis, and then work with each family on their appropriate arrangements, we have the ability to do that,” he said, adding, “We may well be dealing with temporary burials so we can deal with each family later.”The medical examiner’s office said in a statement, “We are planning for all possibilities, however no decision on this has been made, and there is still adequate capacity at this time.”The Times included some additional information from Levine which slightly contradicted DeBlasio’s remarks; further, Levine noted that the storage for deceased COVID-19 victims was almost at capacity in New York:Mr. Levine, however, said in an interview: “This is definitely not in the hypothetical stage now. I think it’s fair to say we are moving to do this.” … Mr. Levine said plans for the possible use of “temporary interment” had been mapped out as part of that plan. He said the city had to face the reality that “traditional burial system has largely frozen up.”“We are relying on freezers now to hold bodies, but that capacity is almost entirely used up,” he said, describing temporary interment as “essentially an extension of the freezer system.”In the ensuing discussion about the claims, Central Park was often mentioned as a possible site for temporary mass graves. That may have been due to Central Park’s prominence among people not personally familiar with Manhattan as well as its size; Levine referenced an established potter’s field on Hart Island (in the Bronx), but cited “logistical challenges” in accessing that site as well as city parks in general:Mr. Levine said the possible sites for mass burials would be a city park or on Hart Island in the Bronx, where inmates from Rikers Island are typically employed to bury the indigent in potter’s field.Hart Island has logistical challenges because it is inaccessible and it is a secure Department of Correction facility, so there are limitations on who can go there and under what circumstances, Mr. Levine said.The use of labor from Rikers’ Island to dig mass graves was a part of early reporting on COVID-19 in New York. On March 10 2020, Business Insider mentioned the same site Levine did, reporting:New York City’s contingency plan for ‘biological outbreaks’ includes mobile refrigerator units for dead bodies and mass graves dug by inmates… Inmates on Rikers Island would be transported to Hart Island to dig mass graves where the dead could be buried, and cremation efforts would be ramped up.Currently, Hart Island, which once housed a prison for Confederate soldiers, has two prepared mass graves that could accommodate 19,200 bodies, but there is another site that has yet to be cleared.That reporting also noted the plan itself was not new in 2020, but was designed during a previous disease outbreak in 2008 — which did not result in the need for mass graves:The plan was developed by the city’s late chief medical examiner, Charles Hirsch, in 2008, in response to concerns that Bird Flu would cause the next pandemic influenza. But as Hirsch states in the report, the plan can be used to tackle “other biological outbreaks” that cause mass fatalities.On March 31 2020, The Intercept reported that Rikers’ Island inmates were offered 6 hourly to begin digging mass graves for COVID-19 victims:NEW YORK CITY is offering prisoners at Rikers Island jail 6 per hour — a fortune by prison labor standards — and personal protective equipment if they agree to help dig mass graves on Hart Island, according to sources with knowledge of the offer. Avery Cohen, a spokesperson for the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed the general arrangement, but said that it was not “Covid-specific,” noting that prisoners have been digging graves on Hart Island for years.The offer is only being made to those with convictions, not those jailed before trial, as is generally the case. A memo sent to prisoners, according to a source who reviewed it, does not specify what the work on Hart Island will be, but the reference to PPE leaves little doubt. The offer comes as New York City continues to be the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, with 38,000 people infected and more than 914 dead so far.That earlier reporting by The Intercept closely echoed details in Levine’s Twitter thread, such as requirements for mass graves and space limitations on Hart Island. It also referenced the March 10 2020 Business Insider piece:Hart Island, though, “has limited burial space,” the report noted, and “may not be able to accommodate a large influx of decedents requiring burial,” which the preparedness plan estimated at between 50,000 and 200,000 in a pandemic with a mortality rate of 2 percent in which 25 to 35 percent of the population is infected.The city document proposed employing the Department of Defense’s “temporary mass internment method,” which places caskets 10 in a row, head to foot, so as not to stack them on top of each other. Hart Island is located off City Island in the Bronx. In 2008, Rikers prisoners were burying roughly 20 to 25 bodies per week there, the report found.Typically, the remains of decedents whose bodies are unclaimed or whose families cannot afford burial are interred on Hart Island. However, the internment of COVID-19 victims amounted to far more burials, far more frequently:Normally, about 25 bodies a week are interred on the island, mostly for people whose families can’t afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. But recently, burial operations have increased from one day a week to five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, said Department of Correction spokesman Jason Kersten.It is true that a New York City councilmember — Levine — disclosed the discussion of plans for mass burials or possible “temporary internments” of COVID-19 victims on Hart Island or in unspecified city parks. Levine and DeBlasio provided different information in terms of the planning stages, and existing information indicated that the plans had been in place since as early as 2008. Although all the information appears to be accurate, we are rating the overall trajectory of the reported mass graves plan as Unknown as of April 6 2020.Update, April 10 2020, 1:52 PM: Numerous outlets (such as the BBC and The Guardian) published aerial footage captured on April 9 2020 and depicting mass graves on Hart Island in the Bronx:New York using mass graves amid coronavirus outbreakhttps://t.co/R61mrlbfdc pic.twitter.com/T0EctJmFPR— BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) April 10, 2020NYC Mayor confirms they are now burying many #Covid19 corpses in mass graves on Hart Island.

Although \\"intense heat\\" may be a strong term, it is the closest option that matches the characteristics of boiling water. (B). cool water - This option is not likely correct because we know that boiling water is hot, not cool. Cool water would not exhibit bubbling or boiling. (C). melted water - Melted water refers to water that has transitioned from a solid (ice) to a liquid state. Although it is an accurate description of water in a liquid state, it doesn't directly relate to the given fact about water being boiling and hot, so it is not the most appropriate answer.

News article: Update: After only a month of criticism—including from Nomad author Ayaan Hirsi Ali, below—the American Academy of Pediatrics has reversed a policy that advised American doctors to give a ceremonial pinprick to girls of immigrant families so that they would avoid seeking a full circumcision. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently put forward a proposal on female genital mutilation. They would like that American doctors be given permission to perform a ceremonial pinprick or “nick” on girls born into communities that practice female genital mutilation. Female circumcision is a custom in many African and Asian countries whereby the genitals of a girl child are cut. There are roughly four procedures. First there is the ritual pinprick. This is what Pediatrics refers to as the “nick” option. To give you an idea of what that means, visualize a preteen girl held down by adults. Her clitoris is tweaked so that the circumcizer can hold it between her forefinger and her thumb. Then she takes a needle and pierces it using enough force for it to go into the peak of the clitoris. As soon as it bleeds, the parents and others attending the ceremony cheer, the girl is comforted and the celebrations follow. Ali Talks to The Daily Beast's Editor-In-Chief, Tina Brown, About \\"Nicking\\" There is a more sinister meaning to the word “nick” if you consider the fact that in some cases it means to cut off the peak of the clitoris. Proponents compare “nicking” to the ritual of boy circumcision. But in the case of the boys, it is the foreskin that is all or partly removed and not a part of the penis head. In the case of the girls, the clitoris is actually mutilated. Then there is the second method whereby a substantial part of the clitoris is removed and the opening of the vagina is sewn together (infibulation). The third variation adds to this the removal of the inner labia. Finally, there is a procedure whereby as much of the clitoris as possible is removed along with the inner and outer labia. Then the inner walls of the vagina are scraped until they bleed and are then bound with pins or thorns. The tissue on either side grows together, forming a thick scar. Two small openings roughly equal to the diameter of a matchstick are left for urination and menstruation respectively. Often these operations are done without anesthesia and with tools such as sharp rocks, razor blades, knives or scissors depending on the location, family income, and education. It is thus more accurate—as does the World Health Organization—to speak of female genital mutilation (FGM) instead of the obscure and positive-sounding “circumcision.” According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, more than 130 million women and girls worldwide have undergone some form of female genital cutting. Some immigrant parents from countries like Egypt, Sudan, Somalia, and others in Europe and the United States, where FGM is common, continue this practice in the West even though they know that it is criminal. Some of them sneak their daughters out of the country during the long school summer vacation so that they can be subjected to any one of these forms of FGM. Congressman Joseph Crowley (D-NY) recently introduced a bill to toughen federal laws by making it a crime to take a girl overseas to be circumcised. He argued, rightly, that FGM serves no medical purpose and is rightfully banned in the U.S. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

It has four main variations, ranging from a ritual pinprick to the removal of a substantial part of the clitoris and sewing the vagina closed, also known as infibulation. These procedures are often performed without anesthesia and with crude tools, and hence organizations like WHO prefer the term female genital mutilation over the ambiguous term, 'circumcision.' Over 130 million women worldwide have undergone some form of FGM. Immigrant parents continue this practice in the West, aware of its illegality, and often take their daughters overseas for these procedures. Congressman Joseph Crowley has proposed a new bill, making it a crime to take a girl overseas for FGM. The AAP's earlier proposal for a ritual pinprick was seen as a way to prevent the more severe forms of FGM, but it drew criticism as critics argue it normalises a fundamentally appalling practice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Delaware: Can Coons Hold Off the Tea Party's O'Donnell? Delaware Senate candidates Republican Christine O'Donnell and Democrat Chris Coons Rob Carr / AP (2) Thanks to Christine O'Donnell and the Tea Party, a lot of Democrats are confident Joe Biden's former Delaware Senate seat is now in the bag. But their celebration may be premature. O'Donnell has already raised more than 1 million since her primary win, and while a competitive race is likely to cost several million dollars, she might not have much trouble, given the national support she'll be getting from the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Sarah Palin. Chuckling Democrats would be wise to remember a woman named Martha Coakley was once considered a shoo-in in another reliably Democratic state, Massachusetts, only to become the first major political scalp of Tea Party politics. But Coakley turned out to be a lousy candidate and Scott Brown caught the world unawares. (See portraits of the Tea Party movement.) Things will be different this time. While some senior Republicans, including Karl Rove, seem convinced that O'Donnell can't win, not all Democrats (including Biden himself) agree. One party strategist with extensive Senate campaign experience told me after her win that he thinks O'Donnell's star power with the far right might enable her to raise money and generate enough enthusiasm to pull off an upset. (Comment on this story.) One reason this strategist said he's not more worried, however, is that he believes O'Donnell's (nationally) unknown Democratic opponent, Chris Coons, is no Martha Coakley. \\"He's very talented,\\" said my source. And he's not the only one to feel that way. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid has already raved about Coons  perhaps to comedic excess  as \\"my pet ... my favorite candidate.\\" (Watch TIME's video \\"Meet the Tea Party.\\") Coons' résumé may not sport anything as colorful as O'Donnell's abstinence and antimasturbation crusading. But he did campaign for Ronald Reagan as a teenager before labeling himself, in a much-quoted-on-the-right college essay, a \\"bearded Marxist.\\" Now 47, Coons has served in county government for the past decade, with the last six years as executive of New Castle County  one of Delaware's three counties and home to about 500,000 of the state's roughly 900,000 residents. His pedigree may be easy for a Tea Partyer to sneer at  undergrad at Amherst, law and divinity school at Yale  but in a relatively prosperous Northeastern state like Delaware (where the unemployment rate is high, but lower than the national average), it may be an asset. (And remember: at least two other Tea Party darlings, Joe Miller in Alaska and Ken Buck in Colorado, also have Ivy League degrees.) Unlike some other Democrats recently running from it, Coons openly supports a cap-and-trade plan to combat global warming; sounds fairly conventional on education reform; and describes himself as a \\"Truman Democrat,\\" which has a slightly hawkish ring but could actually mean almost anything short of Kucinich-ism. (It's hard to find anything Coons has to say about Afghanistan beyond some milquetoasty criticism of Stanley McChrystal's infamous comments to Rolling Stone.) On MSNBC's Hardball Wednesday, Coons said he would have voted for both the health care bill and financial regulatory reform. He has also made an interesting proposal for a lifetime ban on Senate lobbying by former Senators, something unlikely to endear him to his potential new colleagues. (See \\"Republican Surprise: 10 More Scott Browns.\\") The big picture, however, is that this campaign will unfold in a state that went 62-37 for Obama in 2008, thanks in part to the place of local hero Joe Biden on the ticket. Biden already has plans to campaign and raise money for Coons. And polling shows Coons now with a double-digit lead. So Coons could probably get away with being just an ordinary candidate. Especially if the bet reflected by the unusual photo of his opponent on his campaign home page is the right one: just keep people talking about Christine O'Donnell.

Question: Who is supposed by a religious scholar of the time to place themselves in the position of god? Context: A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".

Lecter, his younger sister, Mischa, and his parents escape to the family's hunting lodge in the woods to elude the advancing German troops. Back at Lecter Castle, six Lithuanian militiamen (Grutas, Dortlich, Grentz, Kolnas, Milko, and Pot Watcher) request to join the Waffen-SS. The SS commander orders them to kill the Lecters' Jewish cook who was left behind, to which they gleefully comply.A Soviet tank stops at the Lecters' lodge looking for water, and forces everyone out of the house. However, the tank is then spotted by a German Stuka bomber, which sparks a firefight. The bomber is shot down by the tank, but subsequently crashes into it and the ensuing explosion kills everyone, except Hannibal and Mischa. The SS militiamen then loot Lecter Castle. Seeing their wounded SS commander, Grutas shoots him and takes his Iron Cross. However, the impending Russian advance forces them to hide out in the woods where they locate the Lecter lodge. The SS militiamen storm and take over the lodge. Finding no other food in the bitterly cold Baltic winter, the men look menacingly at Hannibal and Mischa.The movie then cuts to a scene eight years later inside Lecter Castle, which has been turned into a Soviet-run orphanage. A bully harasses Lecter, who has been rendered mute by his experiences, about not singing the orphanage anthem. The bully attacks his head, but Lecter blocks his swing with a fork, impaling the bully's hand. That evening, Lecter experiences a flashback about Mischa screaming in his sleep, which angers the youth commander, who locks him in a dungeon. However, Lecter escapes from the castle orphanage to Paris to live with his widowed aunt, the Lady Murasaki-Lecter. She gets him to speak for the first time since his childhood, and instructs him about flower arrangement, martial arts and ancestor worship.At a local market, a butcher makes a crude and racist...

Review title: VERY DISTURBING AND UNPLEASANT Product review: I finally watched this movie because I think that Tilda is an amazing actress. However, this movie doesn't do her justice. She is the only thing good about the movie, but it's too painful too watch. In the movie, her son is a true psychopath who seems to have been born with the intent to destroy his mother; he does that and so much more. It raises a question that I often ponder: can one be born EVIL??? Is there a chemical or neurological explanation for the monster that he becomes? A:","completion":"To decide whether this review would increase or decrease the chances of me buying the product, I will analyze the content of the review step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the review's overall sentiment The review's title suggests a negative sentiment (\\"VERY DISTURBING AND UNPLEASANT\\"). The text of the review also contains multiple negative statements about the movie, such as \\"it's too painful to watch\\" and \\"this movie doesn't do her (Tilda) justice.\\" Step 2: Identify any positive aspects mentioned The review praises Tilda's acting, stating that \\"Tilda is an amazing actress\\" and \\"She is the only thing good about the movie.\\" Step 3: Weigh the positive and negative aspects While there is one positive aspect mentioned (Tilda's performance), the overall sentiment of the review is negative. The reviewer emphasizes the disturbing and unpleasant nature of the movie, which could be off-putting to potential buyers. Step 4: Make a conclusion Based on the negative sentiment and the potentially disturbing nature of the movie, this review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. The praise for Tilda's acting may not be enough to counterbalance the negative aspects mentioned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Currently, the equation is: 19 = 12*a + 19. Step 2: Subtract 19 from both sides to remove the constant term. 19 - 19 = 12*a + 19 -19. This simplifies to: 0 = 12*a. Step 3: Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable (12). 0/12 = 12*a/12. This simplifies to: 0 = a.

Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Sure enough, Tony gets bitten, and grows fur and fangs whenever there's a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he can't age as long as he has the werewolf curse, and that he has to fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years. But otherwise, the movie's just plain funny once it gets going. Ed McMahon's character is an over-patriotic right-wing yahoo (he thinks that everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars's coach/principal is a tense dweeb, and then there's more. One of the most eye-opening cast members is Demond Wilson - best remembered as Lamont on \\"Sanford and Son\\" - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. But probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents; then gag with Gerald Ford really summed him up! Anyway, it's a real treat.

His contributions spanned areas like science, where he is renowned for his experiments with electricity, to public works, where he instituted the concept of a lending library and fire department. As such, his impact on early American society was profound and lasting.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Soren, a young barn owl, lives in the Tyto Forest with his family: his father, Noctus; his mother, Marella; his older brother, Kludd; his younger sister, Eglantine; and Mrs. P, the family's nest maid, a kindly blind snake. Soren enjoys listening to the 'Legends of Ga'Hoole,' which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones. Kludd berates his brother's dreams, having grown tired of listening to the stories. When their father teaches them the first steps to flying, Kludd becomes jealous of Soren's natural branching ability. Later, when practicing branching while their parents are hunting, Kludd pushes Soren off a branch which forces them both to fall to the ground. They are attacked by a Tasmanian devil but are saved, and then kidnapped, by two owls, Jatt and Jutt. Along the way, more owlets are revealed to have been kidnapped. Soren meets Gylfie, a young elf owl who is also kidnapped. At St. Aegolius, the owlets are greeted by Nyra, who says that they will be divided into either soldiers or 'pickers'.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks. Question: \\"Is Algave known for its beaches and golf courses?\\" Response: \\"It should be\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question; however, the information provided earlier in the text does. The Algarve is indeed known for its beaches and golf courses as it offers around 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, making it one of Europe's premier beach destinations.

Every cruise line will be a little different, so seeing the do's and don'ts laid out in black and white can give you a leg up prior to departure. Some cruise lines may have different dress codes for their dining rooms, lounges, and onboard activities. As a result, you should also be sure to pack the appropriate attire for these occasions; this frequently includes casual clothes, semi-formal options, and formal wear. It is also important to remember that cruise ships often have a range of onboard amenities you may want to bring items for, such as swimming pools (swimwear is essential), fitness centers (athletic wear, socks, and athletic shoes), and spas (comfortable loungewear). For outdoor activities, like shore excursions or engaging in onboard games, pack layers of breathable and comfortable clothing that can be easily adjusted to the changing weather. In addition to clothing, remember to pack essential travel documents such as your passport, booking confirmation, and any necessary visas. Also, it's always a safe bet to bring copies of these important documents, just in case of loss or damage. Moreover, include essential toiletries and medications in your suitcase. While cruise ships may have some available for purchase, it's best to have personal items that you're familiar with and suit your preferences. To save luggage space and avoid potential issues in airport security, pack travel-sized toiletries. Don't forget to bring electronic gadgets, such as your smartphone and camera, as well as the necessary chargers and adapters. Cruise ships offer a variety of onboard activities and picturesque destinations, which you'll definitely want to capture for lasting memories. Lastly, pack a small carry-on bag for embarkation day. This bag should hold your cruise documents, valuables, and items you may need during the first few hours onboard the ship, such as prescription medication, sunscreen, and a change of clothes. Your checked luggage may not immediately arrive at your cabin, so it's best to be prepared for the initial hours of your adventure.

Article: In December 1994, after being tipped off by his former FBI handler about a pending indictment under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, Bulger fled Boston and went into hiding. For 16 years, he remained at large. For 12 of those years, Bulger was prominently listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. Beginning in 1997, the New England media exposed criminal actions by federal, state, and local law enforcement officials tied to Bulger. The revelation caused great embarrassment to the FBI. In 2002, Special Agent John J Connolly was convicted of federal racketeering charges for helping Bulger avoid arrest. In 2008, Special Agent Connolly completed his term on the federal charges and was transferred to Florida where he was convicted of helping plan the murder of John B Callahan, a Bulger rival. In 2014, that conviction was overturned on a technicality. Connolly was the agent leading the investigation of Bulger.

Information: - Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known by the alias Lenin ( 21 January 1924), was a Russian communist revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as head of government of the Russian Republic from 1917 to 1918, of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1918 to 1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a one-party socialist state governed by the Russian Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, he developed political theories known as Leninism. Born to a wealthy middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother's execution in 1887. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist regime, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior figure in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent party theorist through his publications. In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime. Lenin's government was led by the Bolsheviksnow renamed the Communist Partywith some powers initially also held by elected soviets.

The union was a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and came into existence on 30 March 1867. Austria-Hungary consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the CroatianHungarian Settlement (\\"Nagodba\\") in 1868. It was ruled by the House of Habsburg, and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal. Foreign affairs and the military came under joint oversight, but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states. - Yugoslavia (/, ) was a country in Southeast Europe during most of the 20th century. It came into existence after World War I in 1918 under the name of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by the merger of the provisional State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (itself formed from territories of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire) with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia. The Serbian royal House of Karaorevi became the Yugoslav royal dynasty. Yugoslavia gained international recognition on 13 July 1922 at the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris.

Ethnic clashes last month left at least 300 people dead and threatened to revive a civil war that has killed tens of thousands. A 12,000-strong UN mission in South Sudan was unable to prevent attacks. The announcement was made by the East African regional body, Igad, and confirmed by South Sudan cabinet minister Dr Martin Elia Lomuro. President Salva Kiir had previously dismissed the idea of an additional force. The proposal for a new unit in South Sudan was backed by the African Union and discussed at a meeting in Ethiopia of Igad - the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. But much of the details of the force remain unclear. Igad sources have suggested a new force should have a more far-reaching mandate than the existing peacekeeping mission. But after the meeting, South Sudan's Minister of Cabinet Affairs Martin Elia Lomuro told the BBC further talks were needed to discuss the mandate, size and timeline for any force. Correspondents say the group of soldiers from different African countries is likely to be modelled on a similar unit deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo to combat rebels from the M23 group. Last week, President Kiir removed Riek Machar as first vice-president, two weeks after the rival leaders' forces clashed in the capital. The two had backed a peace deal signed in the wake of violence in recent years. In the wake of the latest fighting, Mr Machar's spokesman told AFP news agency that \\"the only hope is a protection force\\". The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza, reporting from the region, said it was also agreed at the Igad meeting that the newly appointed vice-president, Taban Deng, would step down from his position if Mr Machar agreed to return to Juba to rejoin the transitional government. Mr Machar had previously said he would stay away unless a neutral African force was deployed there.

Your old toy car could travel 13 miles for every 1 candy. And your new toy car can travel 40 miles for every 1 candy. You want to go on a 50-mile trip with your new toy car. With your new car, it can travel 40 miles with just 1 candy. But you need to go 50 miles, so you need a little more candy to go the extra 10 miles. Now, let's think about how much of a candy we need to travel the extra 10 miles. Your new car can go 40 miles with 1 candy, right? So, to figure out how much candy we need for 10 miles, we simply divide 10 by 40. That gives us 0.25 candy. So, for a 50-mile trip with your new car, you will now require 1 candy (for the first 40 miles) plus 0.25 candy (for the extra 10 miles). That makes a total of 1.25 candies!

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the character who Link believes is not as heartless as he appears? In 1823, brash naval officer David Farragut boards the Essex and informs its commander, David Porter, that the Navy is commandeering the ship for a top-secret mission. Although the crew is overdue for shore leave, Porter, a cold, efficient leader, lies to them in order to coerce them to volunteer for the dangerous assignment. Farragut soon reunites with his old shipmate, Chief Petty Officer Link, who tries to convince him that Porter, who years earlier trained Farragut harshly in an attempt to teach him patience and discipline, is not as heartless as he appears. This starts to show itself when Porter later reconciles with Farragut about their past and agree to be civil with one another. Once the ship is at sea, Porter and Farragut open their orders and are dismayed to discover their mission: to disguise themselves as pirates, with no ties to or protection from the United States, in order to track down pirates raiding the West Indies. One night soon after, Farragut is in charge of the ship when a storm hits. Link becomes trapped beneath a keg of rum from which he has tried to sneak a drink and Farragut is forced to break the ship's rudder to rescue him. Porter discovers the damage, but even when he threatens to court-martial Farragut, the officer refuses to inform on Link. Within days, the supplies begin to run out, one of the crew contracts scurvy, and Porter steers the rudderless Essex to the West Indies for repairs and supplies. Farragut grows frustrated with the slow drift and, although Porter forbids anyone to enter the shark-infested waters, he tries to repair the rudder himself. When a shark attacks and Farragut's rope catches on a barnacle, he is barely rescued in time, and Porter chastises him again. Six days later, the men finally reach land and Porter orders Farragut and Link to gather supplies.

My wedding experiences were both very different, even though I cried at both ceremonies. At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn’t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn’t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently — I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. Some years after that lengthy incarceration ended, I was fortunate to wed again. I had not done any manual labor before our wedding day. My hands were fine. Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves. We were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance. We had written our own vows, in fact, our own ceremony, including our own rituals. And yes, I cried, because I was / am so in love with my bride.

The loss of trees means fewer places for owls to perch and observe their surroundings, which is an essential part of their hunting strategy. Moreover, deforestation can lead to a decline in the populations of small mammals and other prey, making it more challenging for owls to find food. Additionally, the loss of habitat can cause disruptions in owl populations as they are forced to relocate and adapt to new environments, which may impact their nocturnal hunting efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Este important să privim la contextul și circumstanțele care duc la valurile de refugiati care provin din zonele de conflict și sărăcie. Mulți dintre acești oameni și-au părăsit casele, familiile și viața lor din cauza persecuției, a violenței și a lipsurilor pe care le întâmpină în țările lor de origine. Înțelegerea acestui fenomen și abordarea problemelor structurale ar putea duce la soluții mai eficiente și sustenabile pentru a combate cauzele migrației forțate. Pe termen lung, aceasta ar putea contribui la o reducere a numărului de oameni care se aventurează în călătorii periculoase și periculoase în căutarea unei vieți mai bune. Pe lângă abordarea cauzelor fundamentale care duc la situații de refugiați, este esențial să ne concentrăm pe protejarea și promovarea drepturilor acestor persoane vulnerabile. Guvernele și organizațiile internaționale ar trebui să își unească eforturile pentru a oferi un sprijin adecvat și un acces la sănătate, educație și oportunități economice pentru cei care au fost forțați să-și părăsească casele. În acest sens, este important ca toate părțile implicate să lucreze împreună pentru a veni în întâmpinarea nevoilor și a cerințelor refugiaților, acordând în același timp importanță combaterii traficului de persoane și exploatării acestora. Faptul că guvernul egiptean ia măsuri pentru a investiga acuzațiile și a asigura eliberarea refugiaților este un pas important în această direcție. Pe termen lung, este important să se dezvolte strategii care să abordeze cauzele profunde ale migrației forțate și să se promoveze înțelegerea interculturală și respectul între diferitele comunități și culturi. Aceasta include creșterea cooperării internaționale și dialogul între țări de origine, tranzit și destinație, precum și asigurarea respectării drepturilor și demnității tuturor persoanelor afectate.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: wave his hand B: sign the contract C: stare at the contract Answer:","completion":"After some serious negotiations, Quinn finally agreed to the contract. This context implies that Quinn had gone through a potentially tough or extensive negotiation process to reach a point of agreement on the contract's terms and conditions. Now that Quinn has agreed to the contract, it is essential to understand what will happen to them next. Out of the provided options: A: wave his hand - This action does not accurately represent what would happen to Quinn after agreeing to the contract. Waving one's hand is usually a gesture used in greetings, farewells, or attracting attention. It does not have any direct connection to the contract negotiation context. B: sign the contract - This option is the most likely action to follow after agreeing to a contract. Once parties have settled on the contract terms and conditions, it is customary to sign the document as an official acknowledgment and acceptance of the agreed-upon provisions. Signing the contract solidifies the agreement and creates a legally binding commitment between the involved parties. In this case, Quinn agreeing to the contract suggests that they are ready to finalize the agreement, and therefore, signing the contract would be the next logical step. C: stare at the contract - While it is possible that Quinn might momentarily glance or examine the contract after agreeing to it, merely staring at it would not advance the situation or contribute to finalizing the agreement. Although this option acknowledges the contract's presence, it does not indicate any further commitment or action from Quinn regarding the agreement. Based on the context, the best answer to the question \\"What will happen to Quinn?\\" would be option B: sign the contract.

To hook marks, he acts like a well-to-do businessman, dressing like one and driving a Mercedes-Benz S500, believing that one must look like a professional in order to be a successful conman. Gaddis is searching for a new partner with whom he can perform more sophisticated cons. He discovers Rodrigo after he sees the young man playing some minor con games in a casino-bar. When Rodrigo is caught, Gaddis acts the part of a vice officer to save him from being arrested. Rodrigo's contribution is a face and naive manner so trustable that he is able to con anyone, while Richard is both completely unprincipled and clever. After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees. Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts. Richard accepts, and they plan to sell a fraudulent version of a silver certificate currency note to William Hannigan, a rich collector who is in town. Gyllenhaal plays Gaddis' sister Valerie, a concierge at a hotel. When Hannigan takes a fancy to the uptight but very sexy Valerie, Gaddis is forced to pull her into the scam, the price of which is Richard's admission to their brother Michael that he has cheated him out of his share of their inheritance.

Newport council claims they have a detrimental impact on communities and can cause problems for neighbours. There are currently 2,516 vacant properties in the city, with 1,142 exempt from council tax because they are undergoing major work. The council hopes the move will urge owners to bring them back into use. Under the plans, the council would charge 200% council tax on properties which have been unoccupied and unfurnished for two years or more. Based on the average annual council tax bill for Band D properties in Newport, between Â£1,149 and Â£1,174 depending on the area, the council could recoup about Â£2,200 per property a year. Of the 1,104 empty homes in the city for which council tax is charged, 755 have been vacant for more than a year. The council already has ways to tackle the issue, such as the Houses into Homes loan scheme. But it hopes the extra premium will discourage long-term disuse while also bringing in more money to help it work with owners to bring properties back into use. As well as improving the quality of life for nearby residents, the authority said the move would help increase the availability of affordable homes. Other councils in Wales have already brought in similar measures to cut the rising number of second homes. Anglesey council voted through a 25% increase while Pembrokeshire agreed a 50% increase from April 2017. The move comes after new powers were introduced by the Welsh Government in March. Residents can have their say on the proposals until 31 October.

With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - St George's Channel is a sea channel connecting the Irish Sea to the north and the Celtic Sea to the southwest. - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago. - William III (4 November 1650 8 March 1702; also widely known as William of Orange) was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672, and King of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1689 until his death. It is a coincidence that his regnal number (III) was the same for both Orange and England. As King of Scotland, he is known as William II. He is informally known by sections of the population in Northern Ireland and Scotland as \\"King Billy\\". - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - The River Shannon is the longest river in Ireland at . It drains the Shannon River Basin which has an area of , one fifth of the area of Ireland. - The Williamite War in Ireland (16881691), meaning \\"war of the two kings\\"was a conflict between Jacobites (supporters of the Catholic King James II of England and Ireland, VII of Scotland) and Williamites (supporters of the Dutch Protestant Prince William of Orange) over who would be monarch of the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of Ireland.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Kingdom of Ireland (Classical Irish: '; Modern Irish: ') was a client state of the Kingdom of England that existed on Ireland from 1542 until 1800. It came into being when the Parliament of Ireland passed the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 and proclaimed King Henry VIII of England as King of Ireland. The territory of the Kingdom had previously had the status of a lordship of the Crown. - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel.

When they emerge with a \\"head,\\" it's essential not to squeeze or pop them as doing so can lead to more severe skin issues like scarring, inflammation, and infection. So how do you deal with these difficult-to-remove pimples? In this article, we'll explore various natural exfoliants that can help manage and treat deep pimples for clearer, healthier skin. Honey-Baking Soda Exfoliant Combining the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of raw honey with the gentle exfoliating power of baking soda, this all-natural treatment is a match made in heaven for deep pimples. The honey soothes inflamed skin while baking soda works to slough off dead skin cells, unclog pores, and reduce the size of the pimple. To whip up this exfoliant, mix equal parts raw honey and baking soda in a small bowl. Apply the mixture to your deep pimples and gentle exfoliate for a minute or two in a circular motion. Rinse with warm water and pat dry. For the best results, use this exfoliant 2-3 times a week. Oatmeal Exfoliant Oatmeal is famous for its calming and gentle cleansing properties, making it suitable for all skin types, including sensitive ones. Rich in antioxidants, this exfoliant can help reduce inflammation, redness, and infection associated with deep pimples. To create an oatmeal exfoliant, grind one cup of rolled oats in a blender or food processor until you have a fine powder. Combine this with one cup of warm water and mix well to create a thick paste. Gently massage the mixture onto your deep pimples and leave it for 10-15 minutes before rinsing off with warm water. Repeat the process 2-3 times per week for the best results. Sugar-Olive Oil Exfoliant Sugar and olive oil work together to create a simple yet effective exfoliant that helps reduce inflammation, hydrate the skin and dissolve dead skin cells. The sugar granules provide gentle exfoliation, while olive oil's healthy fats and antioxidants nourish the skin. In a small bowl, combine equal parts granulated sugar and olive oil and mix well. Apply the mixture to your deep pimples and massage gently for 2-3 minutes. Rinse with warm water and pat dry. For optimal results, use this exfoliant once or twice a week. Sea Salt Exfoliant Sea salt carries various minerals like magnesium, calcium, and potassium that are beneficial to skin health. Additionally, sea salt absorbs excess oil, fights off bacteria, and helps to balance the skin's natural pH levels. Consequently, it's an effective natural remedy for deep pimples. To create the sea salt exfoliant, combine two teaspoons of finely ground sea salt with one teaspoon of water and mix well to form a thick paste. Gently massage the mixture into the affected areas in circular motions for a minute or two. Rinse with warm water or a gentle cleanser and pat dry. For best results, use the sea salt exfoliant 2-3 times a week. Conclusion If you are looking to say goodbye to those stubborn deep pimples, incorporating these all-natural exfoliants into your skincare routine may just be the solution. Always do a patch test before applying any new exfoliant to your skin, and if necessary, consult a healthcare professional or dermatologist for tailored advice. Remember, some deep pimples may require medical intervention for safe and effective treatment. Patience, persistence, and a carefully curated skincare routine are the keys to attaining clearer and healthier skin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write some highlights for the following article: Marc Albrighton has been released by Aston Villa with Premier League newcomers Leicester City his likeliest destination. The winger has been with Villa since he was nine but his contract expired this summer and, as Sportsmail revealed on May 9, the Championship winners are understood to be keen on bringing him to the King Power Stadium on a free transfer. Albrighton, the former England Under-21 international, would receive an improved wage at Leicester with Villa failing to offer fresh terms despite his positive end to the Premier League campaign. Moving on: Marc Albrighton (left) is set to leave Aston Villa for Leicester City after his contract wasn't renewed. Better terms: Albrighton could command a higher salary at Leicester, who have just been promoted to the Premier League. The 24-year-old was sent on loan to Wigan for a month last October, only making four appearances, but returned and was one of the brightest playerâ€™s under Paul Lambert during the survival run-in. Leicester need to strengthen in the wide areas with experienced Lloyd Dyer, 31, looking elsewhere when his contract expires next month. Albrighton matches the profile of players manager Nigel Pearson looks for given his youth, fitness, and level-headedness. He would compete for a starting berth with Anthony Knockaert and Riyad Mahrez. Leicester are also poised to bid for Sheffield United's teenage striker Diego de Girolamo. The 18-year-old is an Italy Under 19 international but was born in Chesterfield. Striker Nathan Delfouneso has also been deemed surplus to requirements by Vila boss Paul Lambert. Gone: Nathan Delfouneso (centre) has also left Aston Villa. Lambert said: 'We wish Marc the best in his future career and acknowledge the contribution he has made to the club over the past several years having graduated from our academy.' Delfouneso, another academy graduate who spent last season on loan at Coventry, departs after 50 appearances following his debut, aged 17, in the UEFA Cup tie against Icelandic side FH Hafnarfjorour in August 2008.

However, the statement does shed light on the Eastern Orthodox perspective on the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which is related to the broader topic. To provide a detailed understanding of the Eastern Orthodox Christian beliefs on the story of the Virgin Mary and its significance for followers of the faith, we need to explore the concept of Mary's 'immaculate conception' and its relationship with the doctrines of 'ancestral sin' and 'original sin.' First, let us examine the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. According to Roman Catholic doctrine, the Immaculate Conception refers to the belief that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was conceived without original sin. In other words, the Immaculate Conception teaches that from the moment of her conception, Mary was free from the stain of original sin that affects all human beings. On the other hand, Eastern Orthodox Christianity does not formally accept the dogmatic declaration of the Immaculate Conception. The statement provided explains that contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christians often object to the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception because they perceive it as an \\"over-elaboration\\" of the faith and closely connected to a particular interpretation of the doctrine of ancestral sin. Ancestral sin, in Eastern Orthodox theology, is understood differently from the Western Christian concept of original sin. Ancestral sin emphasizes that human beings inherit the consequences of Adam and Eve's disobedience, such as death, suffering, and the inclination towards sin, rather than inheriting their guilt. This distinction impacts the Eastern Orthodox view on the need for Mary's Immaculate Conception, as they do not believe that human beings are born guilty of original sin, and therefore, there is no inherent requirement for Mary to be preserved from it. Eastern Orthodox Christians venerate Mary as Theotokos, which means the \\"Mother of God\\" or \\"God-bearer.\\" While they do not hold the specific doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, they still acknowledge and honor Mary's role as a unique and sinless human being chosen to give birth to Jesus Christ. They believe that Mary was prepared by God from her conception to be the mother of Jesus, but they do not explicitly attribute this to her being preserved from the ancestral sin. In conclusion, the provided statement addresses the Eastern Orthodox Christians' perspective on the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, but it does not fully answer the question regarding their beliefs on the story of the Virgin Mary and the significance for those who follow its teaching. According to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Mary is highly venerated as Theotokos, and her sinless nature is acknowledged. However, the Immaculate Conception is not considered an essential doctrine by the Eastern Orthodox Church, as it is related more to the Western Christian understanding of original sin rather than the Eastern doctrine of ancestral sin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: \\"Why could Madonna not adopt?\\" Context: \\"Life with My Sister Madonna, a book by Madonna's brother Christopher, debuted at number two on The New York Times bestseller list. The book caused some friction between Madonna and her brother, because of the unsolicited publication. Problems also arose between Madonna and Ritchie, with the media reporting that they were on the verge of separation. Ultimately, Madonna filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences, which was finalized in December 2008. She decided to adopt from Malawi. The country's High Court initially approved the adoption of Chifundo \\"Mercy\\" James; however, the application was rejected because Madonna was not a resident of the country. Madonna appealed, and on June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court of Malawi granted Madonna the right to adopt Mercy James. She also released Celebration, her third greatest-hits album and final release with Warner. It contained the new songs \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Revolver\\" along with 34 hits spanning her career. Celebration reached number one in the UK, tying her with Elvis Presley as the solo act with most number one albums in the British chart history. She appeared at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13, 2009, to speak in tribute to deceased pop star Michael Jackson.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The initial roadblock in Madonna's adoption process came from Malawian law, which stipulates that prospective adoptive parents must be a resident of the country. Madonna, who is not a resident of Malawi, intended to adopt Chifundo \\"Mercy\\" James from the country. Despite the High Court of Malawi initially approving the adoption, they later rejected the application on the basis of her non-residency. This law is typically in place in many countries to ensure the protection and welfare of the child. The belief is that a resident adoptive parent would have a better understanding of the child's cultural and social background. Moreover, it would be easier to assess and monitor the prospective parent's suitability and capacity to adopt. However, international adoptions do occur and are primarily governed by bilateral agreements between countries that can manage and solve these legal and administrative complexities. But for Madonna, this criterion became a temporary barrier to her intended adoption. Unyielding, Madonna decided to appeal against this decision. On June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court of Malawi reversed the earlier verdict and granted Madonna the right to adopt Mercy James. This success did not only illuminate Madonna's relentless pursuit to grow her family through adoption but also highlighted legal intricacies involved in international adoptions. These challenges didn't seem to have impacted Madonna's career, however. During this period, she released \\"Celebration,\\" her third greatest-hits album and her final release with Warner. The album was a success, reaching number one in the UK, tying her record with Elvis Presley for the most number one albums by a solo act on the British chart. She also appeared at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards to pay tribute to the late pop star, Michael Jackson, further demonstrating her resilience and versatility as an artist. Her journey through international adoption, while fraught with obstacles, ended successfully, and added another layer to her multi-faceted public persona."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: HIGH (Human Growth Hormone) could be the favorite drug at the next athletic world championships, and we might never know it. It is a natural substance produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Answer:","completion":"Which statement best describes the use of HGH (Human Growth Hormone) in athletics, according to the article? A) HGH is a synthetic drug that improves athletic performance and is easily detected in drug tests.

C) HGH is a legal substance in most countries and is encouraged to be used by athletes to improve their performance and recovery time. D) HGH has been proven to have no significant impact on athletic performance and recovery time, making it an unattractive substance for athletes to use.

Question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"where does norway get their oil?\\" Answer:","completion":"Norway gets its oil primarily from the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea. The country has vast oil reserves and is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of crude oil. The petroleum industry is a significant part of the Norwegian economy, with the development and extraction of oil resources mainly carried out by large, international oil companies as well as the state-owned company Equinor (formerly Statoil). Major oil fields in Norway include the Ekofisk, Statfjord, Oseberg, Troll, and Johan Sverdrup fields. Oil production in these fields is conducted through offshore platforms and subsea installations. After extraction, the oil is transported through a network of pipelines to onshore facilities for processing and export. Additionally, some oil is exported directly from offshore loading facilities. In summary, Norway gets its oil primarily from the vast oil reserves located in the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea. Offshore platforms and subsea installations are utilized for extraction, and the oil is then transported to onshore facilities for processing and export."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: Rolf Harris repeatedly sexually assaulted the daughter of family friends over a period of years, beginning when she was 13 and on holiday, a court has heard. The entertainer and artist, 84, first assaulted the girl in the late 1970s, grooming her \\"like a pet\\" while she was on holiday, Southwark crown court in London was told on Friday. The alleged victim cannot be named for legal reasons. Opening the prosecution case against Harris, Sasha Wass QC called Harris a \\"Jekyll and Hyde character\\", beloved as a children's entertainer but sexually attracted to children, and who used his fame to assault them. \\"Behind this charming and amicable children's entertainer lay a man who exploited these children who were drawn towards him,\\" she said. The first alleged victim was described by Wass as being repeatedly assaulted by Harris over a number of years, saying her status was \\"like a toy\\". The girl began to drink heavily as a teenager to cope, and soon became an alcoholic, the court heard. The first assault, at a hotel, began when the entertainer pretended to hug and tickle her when she emerged from a shower. Wass said: \\"You will see a pattern during this case of Mr Harris approaching girls in a purely friendly way and then, once he is in close physical contact with them, he takes advantage of the situation in order to indecently assault them. \\"The same happened on this occasion. Mr Harris, having made physical contact with [the girl] on the pretext of a hug and a tickle, then wrapped his hands around her and put his hands inside the towel.\\" The alleged victim was stunned, Wass told the court, having previously been in awe of Harris, who was by this time a well-known celebrity. The Australian-born star assaulted the girl again two days later as she was wrapped in a towel on a beach, the jury was told, and did so again during the holiday. He then carried out similar assaults on the girl over the following years, the jury of six men and six women was told. At times the assaults happened even if other people were nearby, Wass said. \\"Maybe that was part of the excitement for him, knowing he could do this and knowing he could get away with it,\\" she said. As a family friend, the alleged victim did not want to disclose what was happening, the jury heard. The assaults left her petrified of Harris, Wass said, and anxious and panicky when Harris socialised with her family. At the age of 14 she began drinking to cope with the assaults, the court heard, and would drink what she described as a \\"shed-load\\" of gin if she knew Harris was due to visit. Wass said: \\"You will have to ask yourself, why would a 14-year-old girl from a happy family background start drinking in this way? She will say she drank in order to block out what was happening.\\" The teenager was repeatedly assaulted by Harris in the bedroom of her family home while her parents were downstairs, Wass said. After two years of such assaults, Wass said, teachers at her school noted a change in the girl's demeanour, as she appeared prone to tears and worried about matters at home. Still, she did not tell anyone about the assaults. Harris was \\"a pillar of society, a well-respected man and someone who was known as being fond of children\\", Wass noted. The teenager said Harris was \\"using her for his own sexual gratification\\", Wass told the court. \\"He never treated her as an equal or a human being. He never had a meaningful conversation with her. She felt she was just his little toy.\\" Harris, wearing a grey suit, pale pink shirt and patterned tie, sat impassive inside the glassed-in dock listening to proceedings on a hearing loop headset. He denies 12 counts of indecent assault of four girls and women, the youngest aged between seven and eight, and the oldest 19, between 1969 and 1994. The jury, sworn in on Thursday, was asked by the trial judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, to exclude themselves if they were likely to be in contact with close friends or family in Australia or New Zealand during the case, as some of the evidence was connected to those countries. He warned them against researching the trial personally, or being influenced by media coverage. The trial is scheduled to last up to seven weeks. Harris, who lives in Bray, Berkshire, was raised in Western Australia before moving to the UK, where he forged a career in television, music and art. Much of his work has been based around introducing young people to art or interpreting a broad version of Australian culture for an overseas audience, as with his trademark pop hit, Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Clearly if we are to participate in the society in which we live, we must communicate with other people. A great deal of communicating is performed on a person-to-person basis by the simple means of speech. If we travel in buses, buy things in shops, or eat in restaurants, we are likely to have conversations where we give information or opinions, receive news or comment, and very likely to have our views challenged by other members of society. Face to face contact is by no means the only form of communication and during the last two hundred years the art of mass communication has become one of the dominating factors of contemporary society. Two things, above others, have caused the enormous growth of the communication industry. Firstly, inventiveness has led to advanced imprinting, telecommunications photography, radio and television. Secondly, speed has revolutionized the transmission and reception of communications so that local news often takes a back seat to national news, which itself is often almost eclipsed( ) by international news. No longer is the possession of information confined to a privileged minority. In the last century the wealthy man with his own library was indeed fortunate, but today there are public libraries.

Some of our preferences are clearly psychological.Dark blue is the color of the night sky and therefore connected with calm, while yellow is a day color connected with energy and encouragement.Experiments have shown that colors, partly because they are connected with psychology, also have a direct effect on people's mind.People in bright red surroundings show an increase in breathing speed, heartbeat and blood pressure.Red is exciting.Pure blue has exactly the opposite effect; it is a calming color.Being exciting, red was chosen as the signal for danger, but a closer study shows that a bright yellow can produce a more basic state of alarm, so fire engines in some advanced areas are now rushing around in bright yellow colors that stop buses, trucks and cars.

Maria liked to plan their actions out.; B). Monica liked to plan their actions out.;","completion":"Maria's goals were much steadier than Monica's because Maria liked to plan their actions out. This approach allowed her to establish a sense of direction and purpose in her life, whereas Monica opted for a more spontaneous and go-with-the-flow attitude, which sometimes led her to be indecisive and uncertain about the future. Maria's preference for carefully plotted plans stemmed from her innate desire to be in control of her life's trajectory. This meticulous approach allowed her to set realistic objectives and assign herself the necessary time to work towards these long-term goals. The process of mapping out her intentions gave Maria the opportunity to reflect on the potential challenges she might encounter, as well as the necessary resources and skills she needed to acquire to overcome them. By contrast, Monica embraced the unpredictability of life and often found comfort in not knowing what lay ahead. This mindset allowed her to adapt and respond to new situations and opportunities that came her way. Monica believed that being too rigid in her planning could hinder her ability to seize unexpected sources of happiness and success. However, her inclination towards spontaneity could lead to feelings of disorientation and make her more prone to taking impulsive decisions that might not always result in the best outcomes. The distinction in their goal-setting styles was evident in how Maria and Monica approached their careers. Maria, being systematic and methodical in her planning, knew exactly what steps she needed to take to climb the corporate ladder. She identified opportunities for professional growth and made strategic choices that led her to reach her desired career landmarks. Meanwhile, Monica was content with allowing her career path to unfold organically, trusting her instincts and talents to guide her to the right positions. However, it is important to note that neither Maria nor Monica's approaches were inherently superior to the other. Instead, their preferences for how they set and pursued their goals were a reflection of their unique personalities and personal values. Maria's structured and goal-oriented mindset gave her the stability and sense of accomplishment she needed to feel fulfilled, while Monica's more flexible and adaptive approach to life let her explore new experiences and opportunities that she might have otherwise missed. In the end, what worked for Maria did not necessarily work for Monica, and vice versa. The key lesson from their contrasting goal-setting habits is that one must know oneself and find the balance between the two approaches that resonates best with their personality traits and individual aspirations. By acknowledging and embracing our preferences, we can tailor our personal and professional goals to our individual needs, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and successful life journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Instructions: In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity. The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer. Input: Passage: Josh and Dinah Barkley (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) are a husband-and-wife musical comedy team at the peak of their careers. After finishing a new show, Dinah meets serious French playwright Jacques Pierre Barredout, who suggests that Dinah should take up dramatic acting. Dinah tries to keep the suggestion a secret from Josh, but when he finally discovers Dinah hiding a script for Jacques' new show from him, the couple splits up. Their good friend, acerbic composer Ezra Miller tries to trick them back together again, but fails. When Josh secretly watches Dinah's rehearsals for Barredout's new play and sees how she is struggling, he calls her up and pretends to be the Frenchman, giving her notes that help her to understand her part, the young Sarah Bernhardt. As the result, Dinah gives a brilliant performance. After the show, she accidentally learns that her late-night mentor was Josh and not Barredout, so she rushes to Josh's apartment and the two reconcile. Question: What is the last name of the person who secretly watches Dinah's performance? Output:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the person who secretly watches Dinah's performance. Usage: Josh secretly watches Dinah's rehearsals for Barredout's new play. This meets the criteria because it clearly states that Josh is the one watching Dinah's performance secretly. Part #2: Find the last name of the person identified in Part #1. Usage: The last name of the person identified is Barkley, as mentioned in the passage \\"Josh and Dinah Barkley.\\" This meets the criteria because it provides the last name of the character Josh, who was identified in Part #1. Part #3: Provide the unambiguous answer as a phrase from the paragraph. Usage: The answer to the question is \\"Barkley\\" which is an unambiguous phrase from the paragraph that states the last name of Josh, who was the person secretly watching Dinah's performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translation is perhaps the most obvious task in our increasingly global and interconnected world, a task that machines, particularly AI systems, have demonstrated significant proficiency at. Translating from English to German, as in this case, involves an understanding of the syntactic and semantic intricacies of both languages. Starting with the original English sentence, \\"This would give us the opportunity to reach an agreement with the Council in the conciliation procedure, whether it be on 75% or whatever,\\" a direct translation into German would be \\"Dies würde uns die Möglichkeit geben, eine Vereinbarung mit dem Rat im Vermittlungsverfahren zu erreichen, ob es sich um 75% oder was auch immer handelt.\\" As can be seen, the sentence structure and construction remains largely similar, although some words have moved around within the sentence. Breaking down the sentence further, \\"This would give us the opportunity to reach an agreement\\" translates to \\"Dies würde uns die Möglichkeit geben, eine Vereinbarung zu erreichen\\", \\"with the Council in the conciliation procedure\\" translates to \\"mit dem Rat im Vermittlungsverfahren\\", and \\"whether it be on 75% or whatever\\" translates to \\"ob es sich um 75% oder was auch immer handelt\\". It's essential to keep in mind while translating that even the best translation systems still sometimes get things slightly wrong, generally due to the context, subtlety, and nuances present within each language. As such, while the above translation should be accurate and communicates the same overall idea as the original English sentence, it might not capture every subtlety present within the English version.

The formula to calculate the average is (a + b) / 2. Let's perform the task: Step 1: Identify the first two consecutive numbers in the list which are 47 and 31. Step 2: Use the formula (a + b) / 2 to calculate the average. Substituting the values in, we get (47 + 31) / 2 = 39 Step 3: Move to the next pair of consecutive numbers, 31 and 7. Repeat the process to calculate the average: (31 + 7) / 2 = 19 Step 4: The next consecutive pair is 7 and 56. The average is (7 + 56) / 2 = 31.5 Step 5: The final pair is 56 and 55. Their average is (56 + 55) / 2 = 55.5 To summarize, using the guidelines provided and calculating the average for each consecutive pair of numbers, the averages are as follows: 39, 19, 31.5, 55.5.

These elections often shape a country's domestic and foreign policies, which in turn can impact regional and global politics. Therefore, this political event in Indonesia is related to the broader sphere of world affairs. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's predicted victory in the presidential election was perceived as an opportunity for change in Indonesia. As a former military general, Yudhoyono held significant sway in the nation's politics and was poised to contribute to the country's development through new policies and initiatives. His victory would also potentially alter Indonesia's relationships with other countries and international organizations, further emphasizing the significance of this event for the broader world. Conversely, Megawati Sukarnoputri, who was then the incumbent president, was facing the prospect of losing her position in office. Her performance and policies during her tenure would have had repercussions on various aspects of Indonesia's society, economy, and politics, which could be a factor in the voters' decision to support Yudhoyono.

Tässä esimerkissä painotetaan sitä, että tietyissä tilanteissa ja olosuhteissa yhteistyö muiden maiden tai organisaatioiden kanssa on rajoitettava ja vastuullista. Erityisesti tarkastelun aiheena ovat erityistuomioistuinten tai sotilastuomioistuinten kanssa tehty yhteistyö sekä luovuttamista kohtaan sovelletut rajoitukset. Ensinnäkin erityistuomioistuimet ja sotilastuomioistuimet eivät usein tarjoa samanlaista oikeusturvaa kuin siviilituomioistuimet, eikä niiden toiminnassa välitetä samassa määrin kansainvälisistä ihmisoikeusnormeista. Tällaisissa tapauksissa on välttämätöntä noudattaa varovaisuusperiaatetta ja olla tekemättä yhteistyötä noiden toimielinten kanssa, jotta oikeudenmukaisuus ja ihmisoikeuksien kunnioittaminen varmistetaan. Toiseksi luovuttaminen tilanteessa, jossa henkilöä uhkaa kuolemanrangaistus, on vastoin kansainvälisen humanitaarisen oikeuden ja periaatteiden periaatteita. Monet maat ja kansainväliset järjestöt, kuten Euroopan unioni, vastustavat kuolemanrangaistusta ja pyrkivät vaikuttamaan sen lakkauttamiseen maailmanlaajuisesti.

Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\". The answer to this question is:","completion":"The name of the person that Diaghilev turned to is Pierre Monteux. Diaghilev, the founder of Ballets Russes, approached Monteux to conduct Stravinsky's \\"The Rite of Spring,\\" despite Monteux's initial negative reaction to the piece."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I knew that 'Evening' was a girlie film, so I was expecting to be bored. A wicked tease on IMDb had said that it was a 'chick flick' but that your companion would survive. Survive? Yes. I am still here, but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours - it seemed a much longer evening than that! I suppose that, for Yanks, it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well, next to the beach, in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower. If that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film. There's a Monty Python film about a Knight who just won't die. He ends up a wriggling (why do Yanks add an third syllable to this word I wonder) torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis. This film is also about a sort of living dead. Vanessa Redgrave (inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here) goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt. She's not worried about having been a wide-eyed, breathless bimbo, but imagines herself a murderess. Obviously, being a girlie film, there's a chap who is supposed to be the Mr Darcy/Heathcliff character. I'm not a woofter, so I can't claim to be a good judge of such things, but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour. He's a bloodless cypher. As you might gather, the main characters aren't much cop, but the minor ones manage, amazingly to be much worse. There's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers. Fair enough, but it isn't the role of Hamlet - why ham it up so badly? Forgetting that it was a girlie film, I thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl-friend would have told him that face-fungus didn't flatter him, but then I realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a 'beard' because he looked worse without it. I kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery - if you're dragged along to it, see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head, just the sort of thing you'd expect in a beach cottage. Apart from the obligatory wedding, there is only one piece of action. You'd have thought that they'd have got it right. Sadly, though, the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn't be there. When the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can't know is nearby (but we do as the audience). If they don't have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place, then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him? I suppose that the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half-remembered dream sequence... Another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan.

Select from: -- negative; -- positive;","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be definitively categorized as negative. The reviewer seems to have had an unenjoyable experience watching the film 'Evening'. This negative sentiment is evident in the reference to being \\"bored\\" and feeling that the film seemed \\"a much longer evening than that!\\" The reviewer further criticizes various aspects of the film such as the storyline, the setting, the characters, and even the acting. The reviewer implies certain elements were unrealistic or made no sense, such as the hit & run accident scene, the reaction of a character to news of a pregnancy, and the misplaced copper-bottomed saucepan, which is perceived as a historical inaccuracy. The reviewer also often resorts to sarcasm, such as when referring to the prolonged dying of Vanessa Redgrave's character, the descriptions of the Mr. Darcy/Heathcliff character, as well as the out-of-place buffalo head decoration. Moreover, the reviewer's comments also present a tone of dismissiveness and scorn toward the film genre, labeling it a \\"girlie film,\\" and assuming that its appeal is limited to those impressed by narratives about rich people living on the beach. In all, the critique includes multiple statements expressing dissatisfaction or annoyance with the movie, making it decidedly negative in sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Joseph Raymond McCarthy (November 14, 1908 - May 2, 1957) was an American politician who served as U.S. Senator from the state of Wisconsin from 1947 until his death in 1957. Beginning in 1950, McCarthy became the most visible public face of a period in the United States in which Cold War tensions fueled fears of widespread Communist subversion. He is known for alleging that numerous Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers had infiltrated the United States federal government, universities, film industry, and elsewhere. Ultimately, the smear tactics that he used led him to be censured by the U.S. Senate. McCarthy was born in 1908 on a farm in the Town of Grand Chute in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, the fifth of seven children. His mother, Bridget (Tierney), was from County Tipperary, Ireland. His father, Timothy McCarthy, was born in the United States of America, the son of an Irish father and a German mother. McCarthy dropped out of junior high school at age 14 to help his parents manage their farm. He entered Little Wolf High School, in Manawa, Wisconsin, when he was 20 and graduated in one year. He attended Marquette University from 1930 to 1935. McCarthy worked his way through college, studying first electrical engineering for two years, then law, and receiving an LL.B. degree in 1935 from Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee. McCarthy was admitted to the bar in 1935. While working at a law firm in Shawano, Wisconsin, he launched an unsuccessful campaign for district attorney as a Democrat in 1936. In 1939, McCarthy had better success when he ran for the nonpartisan elected post of 10th District circuit judge. (During his years as an attorney, McCarthy made money on the side by gambling.) McCarthy became the youngest circuit judge in the state's history by defeating incumbent Edgar V. Werner, who had been a judge for 24 years. In the campaign, McCarthy exaggerated Werner's age of 66, claiming that he was 73, and so allegedly too old and infirm to handle the duties of his office. Writing of Werner in Reds: McCarthyism In Twentieth-Century America, Ted Morgan wrote: \\"Pompous and condescending, he was disliked by lawyers. He had been reversed often by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and he was so inefficient that he had piled up a huge backlog of cases.\\" McCarthy's judicial career attracted some controversy because of the speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case. What did he do after high school","completion":"After high school, Joseph McCarthy attended Marquette University from 1930 to 1935.

Review title: Don't waste your money Product review: I have never written a review before, but I feel I need to alert people so they don't waste money or ruin their ceilings and woodwork. I bought this because it was marked down. It looked pretty nifty. I would be even more disappointed if I had paid full price. I ended up having to go out and buy tape anyway because this is a horrible product. A metal edge scrapes paint off your woodwork and the ceiling line is horrible.

This product is also messy and has way too many parts that need to be replaced with subsequent paint projects. Answer:","completion":"This review would decrease the chances of me buying the product. Step 1: Analyze the review's tone and content. The tone of the review is negative, with the reviewer expressing their disappointment with the product. They mention issues like scraped paint, a poor ceiling line, messiness, and too many replaceable parts. Step 2: Consider reviewer's experience and credibility. The reviewer claims they have never written a review before, and they took the time to write this one to alert others about the product's flaws. This indicates that their experience was negative enough to motivate them to help others avoid the same disappointment. Step 3: Weigh the reviewer's specific complaints. The reviewer outlines several specific issues with the product, including scraping paint off woodwork, poor performance on ceilings, and the need to replace parts for future projects. These issues can be significant drawbacks for potential buyers who are looking for efficient and effective paint edgers. Step 4: Assess alternative recommendation. The reviewer recommends a different product (Shur-Line Premium Paint Edger) as a better alternative, suggesting that they had a positive experience with it. This provides a potential alternative option for the buyer. Conclusion: Based on the negative tone, specific complaints, and the reviewer's credibility, this review would decrease the chances of me buying the product.

Summarize: Scottish Prison Service bosses had earlier told Kenneth Smith at the Court of Session that they would not open his confidential correspondence. However, the message was not passed on to guards at HMP Glenochil, who opened a letter addressed to him. Lord Pentland found ministers in contempt, but imposed no punishment. Smith had originally gone to the Court of Session after privileged letters from the Information Commissioners Office and Risk Management Authority sent to him at HMP Dumfries and HMP Edinburgh were opened between December 2010 and September 2012. The Scottish Prison Service gave an undertaking to the court that they would stop opening Smith's mail. However, when he was transferred to Glenochil in Clackmannanshire in December 2013, staff there were not informed of the undertaking. One guard opened a letter sent to Smith from the Risk Management Authority, and the inmate took the matter back to court. At the hearing at the Court of Session, the Scottish ministers admitted breaching the undertaking. Lord Pentland said it was clear that Glenochil staff should have been informed of the agreement. He said: \\"I consider that the failure to take that elementary and obvious step was so gross a nature as to demonstrate a disregard for the importance which the prison service should have attached to the undertaking. \\"In these circumstances I am driven to the conclusion that the admitted breach of the undertaking constituted a contempt of court. \\"I agree that no penalty should be imposed. The finding of contempt of court against the Scottish ministers is in itself sufficient to mark the gravity of the failure to honour the undertaking given to the court.\\"","completion":"Scottish Prison Service failed to communicate an agreement to not open inmate Kenneth Smith's confidential correspondence, leading to guards at HMP Glenochil opening a letter addressed to him.

Based on the sentence \\"A man is accepting a check.\\", is the sentence \\"The man took the check off the counter.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"In order to analyze the relationship between these two sentences and determine the validity of the second statement, we need to have a clear understanding of both sentences and look into their contexts. First sentence: \\"A man is accepting a check.\\" This sentence describes a situation where a man is receiving a check from someone, possibly as a form of payment or as a gift. The check is most likely handed over to the man, and he accepts it willingly. Second sentence: \\"The man took the check off the counter.\\" In this sentence, it appears that the check is on a counter, and the man in question picks it up or takes possession of it. It implies a slightly different action compared to the first sentence, because here the check is not being handed over to the man directly but is picked up by him from the counter. Based on the presented information, it cannot be definitively stated that the second sentence is true, as it may or may not be an accurate representation of the situation. There are a few reasons for this: 1. Contextual difference: The first sentence involves the man accepting the check, while the second suggests that the check is on a counter, and the man takes it off from there. These two scenarios don't necessarily align, as the check could be handed over to the man directly in the first sentence. 2. Ambiguity: Without any further context or clarification, it is difficult to determine if the two sentences are referring to the same situation, the same man, or even the same check. It is possible that the second sentence refers to a completely different scenario involving a different man and check. 3. Time and action: The first sentence depicts a man actively accepting a check, whereas the second sentence describes the man's action of physically removing a check from a counter. There could be a progression of events where the first sentence occurs, and later on, the man puts the check on the counter momentarily, then picks it up again, making the second sentence true. However, there is no evidence provided to support such a link between the two sentences. In conclusion, while it is possible that both sentences could be true in the same context, there is not enough information provided to assert that \\"The man took the check off the counter\\" is a true sentence based solely on \\"A man is accepting a check.\\" Further context or details are necessary to make a definitive judgment on the validity of the second statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The initial statement specified that Jason's children are less independent compared to Derrick's. This indicates that Jason's children might require more guidance and supervision, implying that Jason should be more actively involved in their upbringing. 2. Applying the information logically, if Jason's children are less independent then it simplifies that they might need more direct help from him. This leads organically to the statement that Jason must take a hands on approach with his children. 3. Unless there's a context suggesting otherwise, it would not make sense to say that Derrick needs to take on a more hands-on approach with his children as we've been told they are already quite independent.

Despite this setback, the two friends remained determined to find a suitable pair of shoes for Craig, understanding that his struggle was not an uncommon one. They decided to embark on a thorough search that would take them to numerous shoe stores in the area, each offering a unique variety of options. As they ventured from one retailer to the next, Craig began to grow dispirited with the lack of sizes catering to individuals with wider feet. He began to lament his circumstances, feeling a sense of isolation and frustration. However, Derrick refused to let his friend's spirits dampen. He insisted on continuing the hunt and suggested they explore alternative options, such as online stores or considering custom-made footwear. During their search, the duo stumbled upon a small, family-owned business specializing in comfortable shoes for individuals with uncommon feet sizes and shapes. Their excitement grew as they browsed through the unique collection of footwear specifically designed for customers like Craig. The store owner, having experienced a similar problem in the past, boasted a diverse assortment of stylish yet functional options tailored to meet the needs of people who struggle to find properly fitting shoes. As Craig tried on different pairs, he was amazed at the level of comfort and support that these shoes offered. He had never experienced such a perfectly fitting shoe in his life, and his joy was palpable. Derrick, who had always witnessed Craig's struggle with footwear, was equally elated to see his friend finally able to find suitable shoes. Their perseverance had ultimately paid off. Upon purchasing the triumphant pair of shoes, Craig and Derrick left the store with a newfound appreciation for small businesses that cater to niche markets. They acknowledged the importance of not giving up when faced with difficulties and were proud of their determination in finding a solution. It was a testament to their friendship that they were able to overcome this seemingly insurmountable obstacle together. From that day forward, Craig's perspective on shoe shopping had transformed significantly. He no longer dreaded the idea of searching for new footwear, knowing that there were places he could turn to for assistance. Both he and Derrick now actively advocated for the importance of supporting local, specialized businesses that made it their mission to cater to the needs of often-overlooked customers. Ultimately, the success of their day at the shoe store marked a new beginning for Craig and Derrick. Not only did they walk away with the perfect pair of shoes for each of them, but they also acquired valuable life lessons and a reinforced sense of camaraderie.

Summarize the following: If you plan to add new wires or a light switches that to an existing kitchen outlet, make sure the electrical box that houses the outlet has enough room. You will have to replace the box with a larger one if it doesn’t. Use the National Electrical Code to determine the size of the electrical box. Calculate the amount of wires, devices, and clamps you will put in the box. Add 1 cubic inch for each hot and neutral wire, 2 cubic inches for each device (such as a switch), 1 cubic inch for all ground wires, and 1 cubic inch for all clamps. Take this sum and multiply it by either 2 for 14-gauge wire or 2.25 for 12-gauge wire. This calculation will give you the minimum box requirement in cubic inches. You do not have to do calculations for plastic boxes as the volume is stamped inside of them. Do this at the circuit breaker. Find the switch labeled kitchen and make sure it’s off. Test to see if the power is turned off, plug in a device such as a lamp or radio into the outlet and see if it turns on. You can also use a receptacle tester on the outlet. The lights on the test will come on if any power still running into the outlet. While the circuit breaker may be labeled, make sure you test the outlet anyway. There may have been changes in the wiring since the box was installed, or the wiring may be defective. First, unscrew the wall plate that holds the outlet. Then, unscrew the outlet from the electrical box. Take the outlet out and disconnect any wires that are connected to it. The electrical box is nailed to a wall stud.

Brian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer who co-founded the Beach Boys. After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group. In addition to his lifelong struggles with mental illness, Wilson is known for his unorthodox approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques, and he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century. The Beach Boys were formed by Brian, his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Brian Douglas Wilson was born on June 20, 1942, at Centinela Hospital in Inglewood, California, the eldest son of Audree Neva (nee Korthof) and Murry Wilson. His two younger brothers were Dennis and Carl. He has English, Swedish, Dutch, German, and Irish ancestry. When Brian was two, the family moved from Inglewood to 3701 West 119th Street in nearby Hawthorne, California. Speaking of Brian's unusual musical abilities prior to his first birthday, his father said that, as a baby, he could repeat the melody from \\"When the Caissons Go Rolling Along\\" after only a few verses had been sung by the father. Murry Wilson said, \\"He was very clever and quick. I just fell in love with him.\\" At about age two, Brian heard George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, which had an enormous emotional impact on him. A few years later, he was discovered to have diminished hearing in his right ear. The exact cause of this hearing loss is unclear, though theories range from him simply being born partially deaf to a blow to the head from his father, or a neighborhood bully, being to blame. While Brian's father Murry was ostensibly a reasonable provider, he was often abusive. A minor musician and songwriter, he also encouraged his children in this field in numerous ways. At an early age, Brian was given six weeks of lessons on a \\"toy accordion\\" and, at seven and eight, sang solos in church with a choir behind him. At Hawthorne High School, Brian was on the football team as a quarterback, played baseball and was a cross-country runner in his senior year. He sang with various students at school functions and with his family and friends at home, teaching his two brothers harmony parts that all three would then practice. He also played piano obsessively after school, deconstructing the harmonies of the Four Freshmen by listening to short segments of their songs on a phonograph, then working to recreate the blended sounds note by note on the keyboard. He received a Wollensak tape recorder on his 16th birthday, allowing him to experiment with recording songs and early group vocals. Surviving home tapes document his initial efforts singing with various friends and family. In his senior year at Hawthorne High, in addition to classroom music studies, he sang at lunch time with friends like Keith Lent and Bruce Griffin. Brian and Keith worked on a revised version of the tune \\"Hully Gully\\" to support the campaign of a classmate named Carol Hess when she ran for senior class president. Enlisting his cousin and frequent singing partner Mike Love as well as his own brother Carl, Brian's next public performance featured more ambitious arrangements at a fall arts program at his high school. To entice Carl into the group, Brian named the newly formed membership Carl and the Passions. The performance featured tunes by Dion and the Belmonts and the Four Freshmen (\\"It's a Blue World\\"), the latter of which proved difficult for the ensemble. The event was notable for the impression which it made on another musician and classmate of Brian in the audience that night, Al Jardine, who would join the three Wilson brothers and Mike Love a few years later in the Beach Boys.

'We're predicting a rapid rise in the cost to see a family doctor,' says Doctors Reform Society national president. About 82 per cent of GP visits are bulk-billed. For patients who pay privately, the average out-of-pocket cost is 30.","completion":"Title: The Impact of Proposed Changes to Medicare on the Cost of GP Consultations Introduction: The Australian government's proposed changes to Medicare could potentially see the average upfront cost of a 15-minute consultation with a General Practitioner (GP) skyrocket to over 100 in just two years. With affordability being a significant concern for many families, the question of how these changes will impact access to healthcare has become increasingly vital. In this article, we will explore the potential ramifications of the proposed changes on both bulk-billed and private GP visits, as well as the concerns expressed by the Doctors Reform Society. Step 1: Presenting current statistics To establish a clear understanding of the current state of affairs, one should consider that approximately 82 per cent of GP visits are bulk-billed, meaning that Medicare covers the cost of the visit in full. As for the remaining percentage of patients, they opt for a private payment, which has an average out-of-pocket expenditure of 30. Step 2: Discussing the impact of changes on bulk billing With the proposed changes to Medicare, there is a concern that the bulk-billing rates will decline. As a result, a larger proportion of patients will have to bear the burden of increased out-of-pocket costs. This development may lead to financial strain for families and individuals who rely on affordable access to healthcare services. Step 3: Highlighting the predictions of the Doctors Reform Society As stated by the Doctors Reform Society's national president, there could be a \\"rapid rise in the cost to see a family doctor.\\" This situation will undoubtedly affect many Australians' accessibility to healthcare services. Moreover, it may result in the delay of essential preventative care and early treatment of illnesses, which ultimately can lead to more severe health issues down the line. Step 4: Delving into the effects on private patients For the 18 per cent of patients who already pay privately for their GP visits, the proposed Medicare changes may result in an even more significant increase in out-of-pocket expenses. Taking into account inflation and surging costs, this could severely impact those who already struggle to afford healthcare services, pushing some to forego healthcare altogether. Step 5: Concluding remarks In conclusion, the Australian government's proposed changes to Medicare could have far-reaching consequences for both bulk-billed and private patients. With the cost of a 15-minute GP consultation predicted to rise exponentially in just two years, both accessibility to healthcare services and the overall health of the nation may be compromised. To safeguard the well-being of Australians, it is crucial to assess the potential implications of these changes and implement necessary safeguards to ensure equitable access to essential healthcare services."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question Modern electrification systems take AC energy from a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and converted to a DC voltage to be used by traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? And how does all this relate to energy-efficiency? Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for. What nowdays electrification systems can use?","completion":"Nowadays, electrification systems can use a combination of AC (Alternating Current) energy from a power grid and DC (Direct Current) voltage for traction motors in locomotives. Both DC and 3-phase AC motors can be employed in these systems, with 3-phase AC motors necessitating further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC using power electronics. The main task in these electrification systems is converting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive while minimizing energy losses during transmission and conversion. This includes ohmic losses in wires, power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers, and smoothing reactors (inductors). The conversion of electric energy in a DC system usually takes place in a railway substation, where larger, heavier, and more efficient hardware can be utilized. In contrast, an AC system requires conversion onboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. Additional energy consumption for cooling purposes, such as blowing air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware, must also be considered in relation to energy efficiency. In summary, modern electrification systems can use both AC and DC power sources, with the main focus on minimizing energy losses and maximizing efficiency during the conversion and transmission of electrical energy. This involves utilizing DC systems with energy conversion in railway substations, aiming to reduce electrical losses in various components and limiting energy consumption for cooling purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection. Paragraph: Two ancient continents both had a great bird population. At some point in time, the continent of MU experienced a great drought that lasted for several years. The other continent, Lemuria, was unaffected by the drought. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which continent had fewer small-beaked birds die in the drought? Answer:","completion":"Lemuria Justification: As stated in the background information, a drought results in fewer seeds, causing small-beaked birds (which can only eat smaller seeds) to die in larger numbers as compared to the big-beaked birds. However, the paragraph mentions that while the continent of MU had a great drought, Lemuria did not experience the drought. Therefore, since there was no drought in Lemuria, it implies that seed availability was not affected, and so the small-beaked birds would not have died in large numbers due to lack of food. Hence, it can be concluded that Lemuria had fewer small-beaked birds die in the drought."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Sidney Crosby out indefinitely with broken jaw, Pittsburgh Penguins star was hit in mouth by puck in win over Islanders PITTSBURGH — Sidney Crosby has a broken jaw and is out indefinitely after being hit in the mouth with a puck during a win against the New York Islanders on Saturday. The Pittsburgh Penguins said on the team website Sunday that Crosby had surgery Saturday night, and there will be an update on his status later in the week. Crosby, the NHL’s leading scorer, was struck in the face during the first period of the Penguins’ 2-0 win. Slow-motion replays showed multiple teeth flying out of his mouth after the puck struck him during his first shift. The team said Crosby had “major dental work” and will have more done later in the week. The Penguins have won 15 straight games, and next play Buffalo on Tuesday. Crosby has 56 points (15 goals, 41 assists) and holds a 10-point lead in the scoring race. He has not missed a game yet this season after being limited to 22 regular-season games over the prior two calendar years because of concussion-like symptoms and neck issues after absorbing big hits in consecutive games Jan. 1 and Jan. 5, 2011. Midway through his comeback season, Crosby said he was feeling so good he “doesn’t even think about” the risk of concussion or head or neck injury anymore after two years in which it dominated his life. Teammates expressed similar sentiments. After Saturday’s game, coach Dan Bylsma did not rule out the possibility Crosby would undergo evaluation for a concussion. “I think every time that type of thing happens to a player you think of that,” Bylsma said. “It doesn’t matter who it is. ... You think about those things regardless of the player, yes.” There is no indication, however, that Crosby sustained a concussion and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, citing unidentified sources, reported Crosby is free of concussion symptoms. Led by Crosby, the NHL’s leading MVP candidate as this lockout-abbreviated season, the Penguins (28-8) have a league-best 56 points and have opened up a seven-point lead on the Montreal Canadiens atop the Eastern Conference on Saturday. The playoffs are scheduled to begin April 30. After a shot from teammate Brooke Orpik deflected off an Islanders player Saturday, an unsuspecting Crosby was struck as he faced away from the net while standing low and to the inside of the left-wing circle. Crosby immediately collapsed to the ice, his stick flying out of his hand. A pool of blood formed on the ice before training staff came out. Crosby, who wears a visor that covers the top third of his face, soon left the ice, retreating into the locker room under his own power. The accident overshadowed not only the Pittsburgh’s 15th consecutive victory — only one winning streak in NHL history has been longer — but also the Penguins debut of Jarome Iginla. Acquired via a trade with the Calgary Flames early Thursday morning, Iginla said players on the Penguins’ bench were talking and asking about the condition of their captain during the game. “Very tough,” Iginla said. “Very unfortunate play. Seeing on the replay, he didn’t see it coming at all.” . Crosby won the Hart (MVP) and Art Ross (scoring champion) trophies as a 19-year-old in 2006-07 and shared the Rocket Richard (goal leader) with Steven Stamkos in 2009-10. He became the youngest captain lead his team to the Stanley Cup in 2009.

Context: I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me. I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items. Question: Why did Nalini think that her acne would fade once she left her teens? Options: A. Because her parents had acne when they were younger ( and not beyond). B. Because of stress. C. not enough information D. Because of the weather.","completion":"A. Because her parents had acne when they were younger (and not beyond)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Grim disappeared upstairs himself, and returned about ten minutes later in the uniform of a Shereefian officer--that is to say, of Emir Feisul's Syrian army. Nothing could be smarter, not anything better calculated to disguise a man. Disguise, as any actor or detective can tell you, is not so much a matter of make- up as suggestion. It is little mannerisms--unstudied habits that identify. The suggestion that you are some one else is the thing to strive for, not the concealment of who you really are. Grim's skin had been sun-tanned in the Arab campaign under Lawrence against the Turks. The Shereefian helmet is a compromise between the East and West, having a strip of cloth hanging down behind it as far as the shoulders and covering the ears on either side, to take the place of the Arab head-dress. The khaki uniform had just enough of Oriental touch about it to distinguish it from that of a British officer. No man inexperienced in disguise would dream of choosing it; for the simple reason that it would not seem to him disguise enough. Yet Grim now looked so exactly like somebody else that it was hard to believe he was the same man who had been in the room ten minutes before. His mimicry of the Syrian military walk--blended of pride and desire not to seem proud--was perfect. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What uniform did Grim use to disguise himself?\\" is \\"He used a military uniform\\"?","completion":"Yes, that is correct. In the paragraph, it states that Grim used the uniform of a Shereefian officer, which is a part of Emir Feisul's Syrian army.

This suggests that the reviewer did not have a positive overall impression of the film."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: carbon fiber–epoxy and boron fiber–epoxy composites. Compared with metals, these materials are 25%– 50% lighter and thus reduce operating costs. Similarly, the space shuttle payload bay doors and panels are made of a carbon fiber–epoxy composite. The structure of the Boeing 787 has been described as essentially one giant macromolecule, where everything is fastened through cross-linked chemical bonds reinforced with carbon fiber. Metal-matrix composites consist of metals or metal alloys reinforced with fibers. They offer significant advantages for high-temperature applications but pose major manufacturing challenges. For example, obtaining a uniform distribution and alignment of the reinforcing fibers can be difficult, and because organic polymers cannot survive the high temperatures of molten metals, only fibers composed of boron, carbon, or ceramic (such as silicon carbide) can be used. Aluminum alloys reinforced with boron fibers are used in the aerospace industry, where their strength and lightweight properties make up for their relatively high cost. The skins of hypersonic aircraft and structural units in the space shuttle are made of metal-matrix composites. Ceramic-matrix composites contain ceramic fibers in a ceramic matrix material. A typical example is alumina reinforced with silicon carbide fibers. Combining the two very high-melting-point materials results in a composite that has excellent thermal stability, great strength, and corrosion resistance, while the SiC fibers reduce brittleness and cracking. Consequently, these materials are used in very hightemperature applications, such as the leading edge of wings of hypersonic airplanes and jet engine parts. They are also used in the protective ceramic tiles on the space shuttle, which contain short fibers of pure SiO2 mixed with fibers of an aluminum–boron–silicate ceramic. These tiles are excellent thermal insulators and extremely light (their density is only about 0.2 g/cm3). Although their surface reaches a temperature of about 1250°C during...

Input: Question: In the filtration process, the flow velocity is: Options: <1> Directly proportional to the quantity of the cake deposited. <2> Directly proportional to the amount of materials in suspension. <3> Dependent on the degree of ionization of the substance to be filtered. <4> Dependent on the ambient temperature. <5> Inversely proportional to the quantity of the cake deposited. Output:","completion":"1. Evaluate each option based on general knowledge about filtration process: Option 1 suggests that the flow velocity increases as the cake quantity increases. With more cake deposited, the filtering surface may become clogged, reducing the flow velocity. This contradicts the statement, so option 1 is incorrect. Option 2 states that the flow velocity is directly proportional to the materials in suspension. When more suspended materials are present, the filter surface may become occupied faster, causing a decrease in flow velocity. Therefore, option 2 is also incorrect. Option 3 claims that the flow velocity depends on the ionization degree of the substances being filtered. The ionization degree could affect the interaction between particles and the filter, but it has no direct relation to the flow velocity. So option 3 is incorrect. Option 4 suggests that the flow velocity is dependent on the ambient temperature. Temperature could impact some factors, such as the viscosity of a liquid, that may affect flow velocity indirectly.

He was the bassist for the band Long Beach Shortbus which was composed of several members of Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime . Since 2009 , Wilson has been the bassist for Sublime with Rome , a reunited version of Sublime with a new singer . - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Long Beach Shortbus was a reggae-influenced punk band from Long Beach, California. The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002. - The Long Beach Dub Allstars are a dub/ska/rock band formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2002, but reformed 10 years later. - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.

Question 2: What is the difference between rankine cycle and modified rankine cycle? pick from the following. A). no. B). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"A). No. The two questions are not asking the same thing; they are related but cover different aspects of the Rankine cycle in comparison to the Carnot cycle and its modification. Let me provide detailed answers to both questions. Question 1: Why is a Rankine cycle used rather than Carnot cycle in the standard cycle? The Rankine cycle is widely used in power plants and other heat engines due to several practical advantages over the Carnot cycle: 1. Realistic temperature-entropy curve: The Rankine cycle considers the actual temperature-entropy curve for the working fluid, making it more realistic. The Carnot cycle, on the other hand, assumes an ideal gas with a constant specific heat capacity, which is not the case in real-life applications. 2. Saturation temperature: In the Carnot cycle, heat is added and rejected at constant temperatures. However, in Rankine cycle, heat is added at a constant pressure, which ensures the working fluid stays below saturation temperature throughout the process. This prevents any damage or inconvenience in handling due to excessive temperature. 3. Simplicity: The Rankine cycle is simpler in design, as it consists of four basic components: a boiler, a turbine, a condenser, and a pump. The Carnot cycle, in contrast, requires isothermal compression and expansion, which is difficult to achieve in practical applications because of complex heat exchanger designs and heat transfer considerations. 4. Condenser pressure: The Rankine cycle allows the working fluid to condense at a higher pressure than the Carnot cycle, reducing the size and cost of the heat exchanger, as well as improving the overall thermal efficiency of the cycle. 5. Range of working fluids: The Rankine cycle can accommodate a wide range of working fluids, including water, organic fluids, and others. This flexibility allows it to be used in various applications and power generation systems. The Carnot cycle is limited in this regard, as it requires an ideal gas for its operation. Question 2: What is the difference between Rankine cycle and Modified Rankine cycle? The main difference between the Rankine cycle and the modified Rankine cycle lies in the modifications made to improve the cycle's efficiency or adapt it to different environments and operating conditions. Some key differences include: 1. Reheat cycle: In a modified Rankine cycle, the working fluid is reheated after partial expansion in the turbine. This reheating process increases the average temperature at which heat is added to the cycle, leading to improved thermal efficiency. This is particularly useful in large power plants where dealing with low-quality steam could cause erosion or damage to turbine blades. 2. Regenerative cycle: Another modification of the Rankine cycle is the introduction of a regeneration process, which involves extracting steam from the turbine at an intermediate stage and using it to preheat the feedwater before it enters the boiler. This results in a higher overall temperature in the cycle, improving thermal efficiency. 3. Organic Rankine cycle (ORC): The organic Rankine cycle is essentially a modified Rankine cycle that utilizes an organic working fluid, such as hydrocarbons or refrigerants, instead of water. ORC systems are well-suited to low-temperature heat sources, such as geothermal or waste heat recovery applications. These modifications to the Rankine cycle aim to improve its overall performance, adaptability, and suitability in various practical applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There’s a story in my Tuscan family of nobility and forbidden love. It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,...

Information: - Ur (Sumerian: \\"Urim\\"; Sumerian Cuneiform: or ; Akkadian: \\"Uru\\") was an important Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia, located at the site of modern Tell el-Muqayyar in south Iraq's Dhi Qar Governorate. Although Ur was once a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf, the coastline has shifted and the city is now well inland, south of the Euphrates on its right bank, 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from Nasiriyah. - Meskalamdug ( \`\` hero of the good land '' ) was an early ruler ( ensi ) of Ur who does not appear in the Sumerian king list . His tomb , discovered by English archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley in the Royal Cemetery of Ur in 1924 , contained numerous gold artifacts including a golden helmet with an inscription of the king 's name . His wife 's name was queen Ninbanda . Meskalamdug was also mentioned on a seal in another tomb with the title lugal ( king ) , however because his own tomb lacked attendants , Woolley assumed that he was not royal . The controversy remains though , because he is named on a bead inscription discovered in Mari by French archaeologist André Parrot ten years later , as the father of king Mesannepada of Ur , who appears in the king list and in many other inscriptions . - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - Akkadian (\\"akkadû\\", ak-ka-du-u; logogram: URI ) is an extinct East Semitic language (part of the greater Afroasiatic language family) that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia. The earliest attested Semitic language, it used the cuneiform writing system, which was originally used to write the unrelated Ancient Sumerian, a language isolate. The language was named after the city of Akkad, a major centre of Mesopotamian civilization during the Akkadian Empire (ca. 23342154 BC), but the language itself precedes the founding of Akkad by many centuries. - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish. - Dhi Qar Governorate is a governorate in southern Iraq. The provincial capital is Nasiriyah. Prior to 1976 the governorate was known as Muntafiq Governorate. Dhi Qar was the heartland of the ancient Iraqi civilization of Sumer, and includes the ruins of Ur, Eridu, Lagash, Larsa, Girsu, Umma, and Bad-tibira. The southern area of the governorate is covered by Mesopotamian Marshes. - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City. What is the relationship between 'meskalamdug' and 'sovereign'? A:","completion":"Meskalamdug was an early ruler (ensi) of the ancient Sumerian city-state of Ur. A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Sovereign refers to the independent authority a ruler or governing body has over a particular territory. In this context, the relationship between Meskalamdug and 'sovereign' is that Meskalamdug held sovereign power as the ruler of the city-state of Ur, making decisions and governing the city and its territories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we are going to learn about a disease called polio and about the big job doctors and scientists around the world are doing to make sure no one gets this disease again. So, what is polio? Polio is a very serious illness that can make it hard for people to move their bodies, sometimes it can even make it impossible for them to move at all - we call this paralysis. It was once very common all over the world, but today it's something we hardly ever see, thanks to a special medicine called a vaccine. Imagine a superhero movie, where the vaccine is the superhero that uses its superpowers to protect us from the bad guy - which, in this case, is polio! Because of this superhero, polio has been kicked out from most parts of the world. It's like when your favorite superhero defeats the villain and the town is safe again. But, not all parts of the world are safe yet. There are three places - Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria - where polio is still hiding. These places are like the final boss levels in a video game. They're the toughest challenges that our heroes - the doctors, scientists and health workers - are facing in the battle against polio. Why is polio still in these places? Well, doctors and scientists are still figuring that out. It might be because it's really hard to make sure every single person in these places gets the superhero vaccine. Or maybe, the bad guy polio is just being really sneaky and tough to defeat. But don't worry, the brave heroes are not giving up. They're working day and night, doing everything they can think of, to make sure everyone, everywhere, is safe from polio, just like in your favorite superhero movie where the hero never gives up, no matter what. So, that's our story of polio, kids - it's a battle, but we're winning. And hopefully, one day soon, we will live in a world, where no kid and no adult will have to worry about polio ever again!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I jumped at the opportunity to see this show when my time share resort offered discounted tickets to me if I attended their orientation. It was so good! All I have to say is that: The show is so good that I would have paid full price to see it again. Phantom @ The Venetian is the first time I saw Phantom of the Opera live. There were many people that said this show was altered to fit the time frame at Las Vegas, but they still have the best songs in it. The theater is just amazing itself, it resembles the opera house and I love the part of the chandelier drop.

They mention that they were eager to see the show when they had the opportunity, demonstrating their excitement and anticipation. Furthermore, they mention that it was so good that they would have been willing to pay full price to see it again, which implies that they believe the performance was well worth the cost of admission.

They appreciate that the best songs were still included in the show. This validates their satisfaction with the content of the performance itself, despite any modifications it may have undergone. Additionally, the reviewer praises the theater, stating that it resembles an opera house and makes special mention of their enjoyment of the chandelier drop.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What piece was composed as a tribute to Albert Libon? For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an... A:","completion":"Messe de Requiem was composed by Saint-Saëns in memory of his friend Albert Libon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: During this time, two-fifths of the state's territory was divided among 17 rich families which owned practically all of the arable land in Chihuahua. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: To determine the answer to the question, it is essential to first understand the context in which the division of the territory is taking place. The provided information highlights that two-fifths of the state's territory was divided, but the number of families that shared this portion needs to be calculated. To generate a detailed and long response to the question, it is crucial to dive deeper into the underlying issues, including the possible implications of such a division and the historical context that led to this occurrence. This analysis could potentially shed light on the socioeconomic and political environment at the time of the division. The division of two-fifths of the state's territory among families may stem from historical claims to the land, including legal title ownership or inheritance. Factors that come into play while determining these divisions might include population density, economic opportunities, and access to natural resources. Often, the division of land serves to concentrate wealth, power, and influence among a few influential families, potentially leading to widespread socioeconomic disparities in the state. Moreover, the division could raise questions about equitable distribution of wealth and land, as well as land use policies aimed at promoting sustainable agricultural practices and equitable land reforms. It is essential to examine these factors in the context of the state's overall development strategy, including relevant legislation and land reform initiatives. From the provided information, it is not possible to determine the number of families that shared the two-fifths of the state's territory but by giving historical context and considering the factors mentioned above, a meaningful discussion regarding land distribution and its implications can be generated.

In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. Therefore, a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state. They are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of. However, a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates. - Weimar Republic is an unofficial, historical designation for the German state between 1919 and 1933. The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was still \\"Deutsches Reich\\"; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the \\"Deutsches Reich\\" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries both left- and right-wing); and contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. However, the Weimar Republic government successfully reformed the currency, unified tax policies, and organized the railway system. Weimar Germany eliminated most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles; it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border. - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - International law is the set of rules generally regarded and accepted as binding in relations between states and between nations. It serves as a framework for the practice of stable and organized international relations. International law differs from state-based legal systems in that it is primarily applicable to countries rather than to private citizens. National law may become international law when treaties delegate national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions may require national law to conform to respective parts. - The French Fourth Republic was the republican government of France between 1946 and 1958, governed by the fourth republican constitution. It was in many ways a revival of the Third Republic, which was in place before World War II, and suffered many of the same problems. France adopted the constitution of the Fourth Republic on 13 October 1946. - The Elbe (; Low German: \\"Elv\\") is one of the major rivers of Central Europe. It rises in the Krkonoše Mountains of the northern Czech Republic before traversing much of Bohemia (Czech Republic), then Germany and flowing into the North Sea at Cuxhaven, northwest of Hamburg. Its total length is . - Brandenburg (Lower Sorbian: \\"Bramborska\\") is one of the sixteen federated states of Germany. It lies in the northeast of the country covering an area of 29,478 square kilometers and has 2.48 million inhabitants. The capital and largest city is Potsdam. Brandenburg surrounds but does not include the national capital and city-state Berlin forming a metropolitan area. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - The Metropolregion Hamburg (German for Hamburg Metropolitan Region) is the compilation of eight districts in the German federal state of Lower Saxony, six districts in Schleswig-Holstein, two districts in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the city-state of Hamburg in northern Germany. It covers an area of ca , and is home to more than 5.1 million inhabitants. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Saarbrücken ([], Rhine Franconian: \\"Saarbrigge\\" []) is the capital and largest city of the state of Saarland, Germany. Saarbrücken is Saarland's administrative, commercial and cultural centre. The city is situated next to the French border at the heart of the metropolitan area of Saarland. - West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War era, NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany were divided by the Inner German border. After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP. - The Havel is a river in north-eastern Germany, flowing through the German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Berlin and Saxony-Anhalt. It is a right tributary of the Elbe river and long. However, the direct distance from its source to its mouth is only . - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - The Berlin Wall was a barrier that divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989. Constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany), starting on 13 August 1961, the Wall completely cut off (by land) West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from East Berlin until government officials opened it in November 1989. Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and was completed in 1992. The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, which circumscribed a wide area (later known as the \\"death strip\\") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, \\"fakir beds\\" and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc claimed that the Wall was erected to protect its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the \\"will of the people\\" in building a socialist state in East Germany. In practice, the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that had marked East Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period. - The inner German border (or \\"deutsch-deutsche Grenze\\"; initially also \\"Zonengrenze\\") was the border between the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, West Germany) from 1949 to 1990. Not including the similar but physically separate Berlin Wall, the border was long and ran from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia. - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany. What is the relationship between 'saar protectorate' and 'saarbrücken'? Answer:","completion":"The Saar Protectorate was a short-lived protectorate partitioned from Germany after its defeat in World War II, and it was administered by the French Fourth Republic. The Saarland, which emerged from the Saar Protectorate, is one of the sixteen federal states of Germany, with its capital at Saarbrücken. Saarbrücken is the largest city and the administrative, commercial, and cultural center of Saarland. So, the relationship between the Saar Protectorate and Saarbrücken is that Saarbrücken is the capital city of the Saarland, which was formerly the Saar Protectorate under French administration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an input i,A where i is an integer and A is an array. You need to find every ith element of A starting with the 1st element. Q: 1, ['f', '4223', 'Y', 'o', 'w', '2573', '5389', '4377', '807', 'N', 'a', '781', '2687', 'B'] A:","completion":"To find every ith element of A starting with the 1st element, follow these steps: 1.

Initialize an empty list called 'output' to collect the ith elements of the array A. 3. Loop through the array using an index, which we'll call 'index': - Start with index = 0 (since we're starting with the 1st element of the array) - Increase the index by i after each iteration (in this case, i = 1) - Continue looping until index >= len(A), which means we've reached the end of the array. 4. In each iteration, get the element in the array A at the current index and append it to the output list. - Use A[index] to access the element at the current index. - Use the append() method to add the element to the output list. 5. After the loop is finished, return the output list containing all the ith elements starting with the 1st element. Justification for each step: - Steps 1-2: Setting up the necessary variables and lists for solving the problem. - Step 3: Looping through the array A with an incremental step of i (1 in this case) to collect all the necessary elements. - Step 4: Appending each ith element to the output list to create a collection of ith elements. - Step 5: Returning the output list as the final result. Here is the implementation: \`\`\`python i = 1 A = ['f', '4223', 'Y', 'o', 'w', '2573', '5389', '4377', '807', 'N', 'a', '781', '2687', 'B'] output = [] for index in range(0, len(A), i): element = A[index] output.append(element) # Output: ['f', '4223', 'Y', 'o', 'w', '2573', '5389', '4377', '807', 'N', 'a', '781', '2687', 'B'] \`\`\` In this particular case, i is 1, which means we will get all elements of the array in the output list. The final output is: ['f', '4223', 'Y', 'o', 'w', '2573', '5389', '4377', '807', 'N', 'a', '781', '2687', 'B']"},{"prompt":"Question: The group decides to return to where?

The low mechanical complexity of hydraulic elevators in comparison to traction elevators makes them ideal for low rise, low traffic installations. They are less energy efficient as the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight. The high current draw of the pump when starting up also places higher demands on a building’s electrical system. There are also environmental concerns should the lifting cylinder leak fluid into the ground.

Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems: Large HVAC systems require significant electrical power to operate, especially during peak heating or cooling times when multiple units might need to run simultaneously. 2. Lighting Systems: Both indoor and outdoor lighting can contribute to increased electrical demand. This includes not only general lighting but also any specialized illumination, such as emergency lighting, signage, and decorative lighting. 3. Appliances and office equipment: Various electrical devices like computers, printers, refrigerators, cooking appliances, and other office equipment can place a higher demand on the electrical system when used frequently or simultaneously. 4. Power surges: Sudden increases in the electrical demand, such as when multiple large appliances start up at once, can cause temporary spikes in the electrical system's load. 5. Building Occupancy: As the number of people using a building increases, so does the demand for electricity. This includes increased usage of lights, appliances, and other electrical systems. 6. Additional electrical systems: Security systems, audio/video systems, telecommunication systems, and other specialized systems installed in a building may also contribute to the overall electrical demand. 7. Aging electrical infrastructure: Older electrical systems may not be as efficient or well-maintained as newer ones, which could lead to increased electrical demand and possible issues with power quality. It is crucial to properly assess and manage the electrical demand in a building to ensure the overall efficiency, safety, and reliability of the electrical system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To conclude whether this situation refers to team bowling, one would need further information to clarify the context. For example, it would be important to know if these two players are part of a larger group representing a team or if they are simply participating in a friendly game for personal enjoyment. Team bowling typically involves several players, who combine their individual scores to produce a total team score. Moreover, team bowling is also often characterized by distinctive elements such as team uniforms, organized leagues or tournaments, and possible teamwork between members to strategize for better scores and outcomes during competitions. Without any of this information available, it is impossible to determine whether these two individuals are participating in team bowling or not. In summary, based on the given information of one female and one male playing a game of bowling, one cannot conclusively determine if they are bowling by team players.

A mule is the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare). Horses and donkeys are different species, with different numbers of chromosomes. Of the two F1 hybrids (first generation hybrids) between these two species, a mule is easier to obtain than a hinny, which is the offspring of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion). Is it true that is a donkey and a mule the same thing?","completion":"To answer the question, let's break down the information and compare the definitions of a donkey and a mule. Step 1: Defining a donkey A donkey is a domesticated animal belonging to the species Equus asinus. They have a specific number of chromosomes. Step 2: Defining a mule A mule, as mentioned, is the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare). It is a hybrid animal resulting from the crossbreeding of two different species, Equus asinus (donkey) and Equus caballus (horse). Due to the different number of chromosomes in each parent, mules are usually sterile. Step 3: Comparing donkeys and mules - Donkeys are a distinct species, while mules are hybrids between two species (donkeys and horses). - Donkeys have a specific set of chromosomes consistent within their species, while mules have a mixed set of chromosomes from each parent species.

Question: I have a new situation: Tommy sets two pots of water, Pot A and Pot B, on the stove and sets each burner to a different temperature. Tommy is unable to see what the temperatures of the burners are though. He sits around patiently and waits until he notices that Pot B's water is beginning to vaporize, while Pot A's water is not vaporizing. But I can use this background: Continued heating of the water after the ice has completely melted will now increase the kinetic energy of the liquid molecules and the temperature will rise. Assuming that the atmospheric pressure is standard, the temperature will rise steadily until it reaches 100°C. At this point, the added energy from the heat will cause the liquid to begin to vaporize. As with the previous state change, the temperature will remain at 100°C while the water molecules are going from the liquid to the gas or vapor state. Once all the liquid has completely boiled away, continued heating of the steam (remember the container is closed) will increase its temperature above 100°C. What is an answer for this question: The water in which pot is hotter? Answer:","completion":"The water in Pot B is hotter.

Fact 2: Stems of plants include trunks and branches. Given the two facts above, what part of a tree would be woody and covered in bark? The answer is:","completion":"Both the trunk and the branches of the tree would be woody and covered in bark. To elaborate: The woody stem of the tree includes both its trunk and its branches. These structures fulfill a variety of essential functions for the growth, development, and survival of trees. First, let's discuss the trunk. The trunk is the main body of the tree, connecting its roots to its branches. Internally, it consists of multiple layers that perform different tasks, such as transporting water and nutrients, supporting the tree, and promoting growth. One of these layers is the bark, which is the protective outer covering of the tree's trunk. Certain factors including the species of tree, its geographical location, and age can influence the texture and appearance of the bark. Irrespective of these varying factors, bark generally serves as an armor against external threats such as pests, diseases, and harsh weather, effectively safeguarding the inner, more vulnerable layers of the trunk. Moving on to the branches, these are an extension of the tree's trunk and are mainly involved in spreading out to seek sunlight for performing photosynthesis. Similar to the trunk, branches also consist of woody tissue that provides them strength and helps them reach towards the light effectively. This woody substance is covered by bark, offering them the same level of protection as offered to the trunk. In other words, bark acts as a protective barrier for branches too, protecting them from external threats. Given the above, considering both the trunk and the branches of a tree are classified as its stem, and as such, are declared to be covered by bark and made of woody tissue, it's clear that both these parts of a tree - its trunk and branches - would indeed be woody and covered in bark."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
