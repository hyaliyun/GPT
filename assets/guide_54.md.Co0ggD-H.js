Answer:","completion":"Inez Milholland was born on August 6, 1886, in Brooklyn, New York, to parents John Elmer Milholland and Jean Torrey. With a birth name of Inez Milholland, she grew up with an interest in social causes and equal rights, which eventually became integral to her career and legacy. Inez attended Vassar College, where she cultivated her love for activism and fought for women's rights. As a well-educated woman, Inez dedicated her life to promoting equality and social justice, becoming a prominent figure during the early 20th century in the United States. In 1913, Inez married Eugene Jan Boissevain, a Dutch businessman and fellow activist. The couple remained married until her untimely death in 1916. Inez Milholland was not only a suffragist and advocate for women's rights, but she was also a skilled orator and a lawyer. Using her background in law, she fought for various social causes like labor rights, world peace, and equality for people of all races and genders. During her short yet impactful life, Inez became a symbol of the women's suffrage movement in America. Her tireless work and spirit inspired many others to join the fight for equal voting rights, earning her a lasting legacy. Unfortunately, Inez passed away at the young age of 30 on November 25, 1916. Her death took place at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, California, and was caused by pernicious anemia, a condition where the body cannot properly absorb vitamin B12, leading to severe anemia and various health complications. Inez Milholland's image, captured in a photograph known as \\"Inez Milholland.jpg,\\" serves as a lasting reminder of a woman who dedicated her life to fight for equal rights and social change. Her legacy continues to inspire activists across generations, and she will always be remembered as a trailblazer in the fight for women's rights."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here's the problem: several of my friends who still live with their parents wish they had places like mine -- so much so that they make mine theirs.

They bring boyfriends over, talk on the phone and stay out forever. I enjoy having my friends here sometimes-- it makes the place feel comfortable and warm-- but this is my home, not a party house.

The real story behind Princess Diana's early 90s short haircut Many of us are familiar with the—and we hesitate before using this word, but we're going to go ahead with it anyway—iconic 1991 shot of Princess Diana, chin resting on her folded-over hands, wearing a black turtleneck, hair chopped short. And thanks to hairstylist Sam McKnight, who has a new book and exhibition out, we now have some of the backstory about what led to that dramatic stylistic switch. McKnight recounts, to the Daily Mail, that his first time working with the princess was in 1990, when she was brought in to be photographed by Patrick Demarchelier (McKnight had guessed beforehand they'd be photographing Margaret Thatcher when he heard they were \\"shooting someone important for Vogue\\"). For that shoot, he used some hairstyling trickery—\\"using hair grips to tuck her shoulder-length hair under the tiara\\"—to make it look like she had short hair. Related: Remembering Princess Diana's Glamorous Style Diana was evidently quite pleased with the look as, after the shoot, McKnight says that she asked him, \\"What would you do with my hair if I gave you free rein?\\" He responded, \\"I would cut it all off,\\" and, as McKnight puts it, \\"She was convinced immediately.\\" The rest, as they say, was . . . a famous haircut. McKnight explains that it was \\"one of the cuts that women suddenly wanted,\\" as it popped up \\"everywhere—on the High Street, on newsreaders.\\" He hypothesizes that the popularity was related to its contrast to the \\"big 80s hair,\\" representing a \\"sportier, more androgynous look,\\" but one that was \\"still hugely feminine.\\" McKnight went on to work closely with Diana (\\"I saw Diana every week when I was in London\\"). During one meeting with Linda Evangelista and Vogue editor Liz Tilberis, McKnight told them about a shoot he had done earlier in the week with Diana and Demarchelier, and imparted that one picture in particular \\"would make a great Vogue cover.\\" And, yep, you guessed it: it's the black turtleneck shot, which ran as the cover of British Vogue in December 1991. And McKnight shares one final, special detail about the image: \\"She had just stopped biting her nails and was so proud of how they looked.\\" More from Vanity Fair:Kate Middleton's Best Looks of 2016Annie Leibovitz's Intimate Portraits of Queen Elizabeth II and the Royal FamilyPrince Harry's Best Style Moments Photo credit: Julian Parker/UK Press/Getty Images Lady Diana Spencer, later the wife of Prince Charles, on her first birthday at Park House, Sandringham.

Rhinella yunga lives in the Peruvian Andes, specifically in the region known as the Yungas, reports the Guardian. It escapes notice by hanging out on forest floors among dead leaves, and smartly so: The toad not only has the right coloring, it has \\"bony protusions\\" that make it look more leaf-like, reports Nature World News. It turns out that this particular species had been mistakenly lumped in with a cousin toad for years, but Rhinella yunga has something unique going on: It lacks eardrums, reports LiveScience. That doesn't necessarily mean that the toad can't hear or communicate effectively, only that scientists haven't figured out how it does so. For example, this frog also lacks eardrums but manages the nifty trick of hearing through its mouth. Expand this summary.","completion":"The recent discovery of a new species of toad, Rhinella Yunga, in the Peruvian Andes has intrigued scientists and sparked interest in the animal's unique features, habitat, and characteristics. The elusive Rhinella Yunga exhibits remarkable camouflage abilities, making it extremely challenging to spot in its natural environment. Its appearance closely resembles a dead leaf, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the forest floor amongst other leaves. This fascinating animal can be found in a specific region of the Peruvian Andes called the Yungas, as reported by the Guardian. The Rhinella Yunga's convincing dead leaf mimicry is achieved through various adaptations. Its distinctive coloring matches that of decaying leaves, and it possesses bony protusions, which give it a more leaf-like texture and appearance. These adaptations have enabled the toad to escape detection by predators and researchers alike. So successful is its camouflage that for many years, Rhinella Yunga was misidentified as a closely related species of toad. Nature World News explains that this misidentification has only been rectified with recent examinations of the toad's unique characteristics. One particularly intriguing feature of the Rhinella Yunga is that it lacks eardrums. This unusual trait raises questions about the toad's ability to hear and communicate. Although the absence of eardrums might initially suggest that the toad is unable to perceive sound or engage in auditory communication, further research is necessary to determine the exact impact of this anatomical peculiarity. LiveScience reports that it is entirely possible that the toad has developed alternative methods for hearing and sound detection which have not yet been identified by scientists. A similar example can be found in a species of frog that has no eardrums but can hear through its mouth. The discovery of Rhinella Yunga highlights the importance of ongoing research and exploration in the natural world. The new species not only adds to our understanding of biodiversity and evolution but also serves as a reminder of the myriad ways in which animals have adapted to their environments to ensure their survival. The Rhinella Yunga's unique appearance, habitat, and characteristics offer valuable opportunities for further study, particularly in the areas of animal camouflage, hearing mechanisms, and communication. This remarkable toad has captured the imagination of the scientific community and the public alike and will likely continue to spark curiosity, admiration, and inquiry for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For now, the acting chair is the Conservative former minister, Tim Loughton (last seen leading Andrea Leadsom's march on Westminster, during the abortive Tory leadership campaign), but under the carve-up which dictates which party has the chairs of which committee, Mr Vaz's long-term replacement must be a Labour MP. Mentioned in dispatches are Chuka Umunna, who has the advantage of having already being a committee member, and of having proved an effective interrogator at evidence sessions. And there is some speculation that the former shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, or possibly another former frontbencher, Caroline Flint, might run - although it is unlikely that they would run against each other. Then there's the small matter of getting elected. Remember that select committee chairs may have to come from a particular party, but they are elected by the whole House of Commons. So if you have three or four candidates from the ranks of Labour MPs, the winner will be the one who appeals most to the Conservatives and, to a lesser extent, the SNP. The same factor weighs heavily in calculations about another plum select committee post in play; the chair of the Brexit Committee, which is expected to be set up to monitor the doings of Brexit Secretary David Davis and his newly-created Department for Exiting the European Union. The assumption is that the Conservatives will not permit Labour to chair such a sensitive committee, but that in turn means that Labour votes could be decisive in choosing which Conservative would then take the chair. And experience suggests they tend to back the candidate they calculate would cause the government the maximum grief. At the moment, the rumour mill suggests former Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt might be a candidate, and two other ex-ministers, Anna Soubry and Nick Herbert are also being mentioned in dispatches. None of them backed \\"Leave\\" in the EU Referendum, although a Brexiteer standard bearer will almost certainly emerge. But if Labour MPs want a Brexit Committee chair who would cause trouble for the government, that line up of candidates provides them with the option. As I write, the details of the Brexit Committee have not been decided (one cunning wheeze would be to allow it to be chaired by the Northern Ireland DUP - guaranteeing a staunch Brexiteer in the chair) and one key issue for the smaller parties is how many members it will have. Most select committees have 11 members, but so important is the subject matter that there is pressure to expand the Brexit Committee to 13, so that the DUP and the Liberal Democrats can be represented on it. Then there's the other new committee, to monitor Liam Fox's new Department for International Trade. The speculation is that this will be chaired by an SNP MP, because Theresa May's abolition of the Department for Energy and Climate Change will, eventually, mean the demise of the DECC Committee, which is one of the two allocated to be chaired by an SNP member. (Incidentally, the DECC Committee is not dead yet; its members are due to depart this weekend on a trip to San Francisco, being sure, no doubt, to wear some flowers in their hair.) There are still some voices murmuring that there's no need to create new committees, perhaps because they could turn some existing committees, particularly Foreign Affairs, into a bit of a backwater. But it does look likely that they will spring into being, with members being elected in late October, or even November. And don't forget that Theresa May created two more vacancies on the Committee corridor, when she promoted Culture Committee Chair Jesse Norman and Science Committee Chair Nicola Blackwood to ministerial office. So an autumnal orgy of electioneering is certain to hit the Commons.

In week three, Chicago hosted the 2-0 Pittsburgh Steelers, who trailed the all-time series 18-7-1 and had not defeated the Bears since 2005. WBBM-TV writer Jeff Joniak described the Bears as in \\"clean-up mode\\" after a poor performance in Tampa. The battle between the Bears' rushing attack and the Steelers' run defense featured the former averaging just 2.9 yards per carry (27th in the league) taking on a defense that allowed just 74 yards per game and 3.3 yards per carry. Joniak added Chicago's running game should try to make progress on early downs to allow Mike Glennon to succeed against Pittsburgh. Defensively, Joniak wrote the Bears had \\"their hands full\\" as Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was aided by receivers Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant, running back Le'Veon Bell, and tight end Jesse James. In spite of Pittsburgh's success in contrast with Chicago's struggles, a common belief was that the Steelers would often \\"play down to their competition,\\" one that was spurned in the wake of Glennon's 2014 Buccaneers upsetting the Steelers 27-24. The first two drives of the game ended with punts, but on the Bears' first punt of the game, Steelers returner Eli Rogers muffed the ball and Sherrick McManis recovered. Jordan Howard would score a three-yard touchdown run on the drive. On the Steelers' next drive, Roethlisberger was sacked by Bryce Callahan and fumbled, with Akiem Hicks recovering. The takeaway failed to result in points, however, as Connor Barth missed a 47-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Roethlisberger threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Brown, which the Bears responded via Glennon's two-yard touchdown pass to Adam Shaheen. On the final play of the first half, Chris Boswell's 35-yard field goal was blocked by McManis into Marcus Cooper's hands. Cooper raced down the field before suddenly slowing down before he reached the end zone, which allowed Pittsburgh's Vance McDonald to knock the ball away at the one-yard line. The ball was then batted out of the end zone, which led to a penalty against the Steelers and an untimed play for the Bears. A false start penalty on Charles Leno Jr. prompted the Bears to instead kick a 24-yard field goal. In the second half, the Bears suffered their first turnover of the game when Howard was stripped by Ryan Shazier; the Steelers took advantage to score on Bell's one-yard touchdown run. A second giveaway occurred when Glennon's pass for Zach Miller was intercepted by J. J. Wilcox, which enabled the Steelers to tie the game on Boswell's 32-yard field goal. The game remained scoreless through the rest of the half, resulting in overtime. After winning the coin toss to start overtime with the ball, the Bears quickly scored on the second play of the series; Tarik Cohen broke through for a 73-yard touchdown run, but was ruled to have stepped out of bounds at the Steelers' 37-yard line. Two plays later, Howard scored the game-winning touchdown on a 19-yard run. In claiming their first victory of the season, the Bears' running backs provided a solid performance, recording a combined 220 yards on the ground - 200 yards more than in week two. The defense also shone, forcing two turnovers after having just one in the first two games. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Context: Eventually, when it was more common for electric recordings to be played back electrically in the 1930s and 1940s, the overall tone was much like listening to a radio of the era. Magnetic pickups became more common and were better designed as time went on, making it possible to improve the damping of spurious resonances. Crystal pickups were also introduced as lower cost alternatives. The dynamic or moving coil microphone was introduced around 1930 and the velocity or ribbon microphone in 1932.

Context: Holometabolism, or complete metamorphosis, is where the insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.:151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.

Step 2: Compare the main ideas and identify differences. - Differences: Sentence 1 mentions the support in terms of paying bills and hiring bodyguards, while Sentence 2 only mentions paying bills. Additionally, Sentence 1 refers to the person as a \\"preachy idealist\\" and Sentence 2 only as an \\"idealist\\". Step 3: Determine if the main ideas/themes are consistent. - The main theme of both sentences is that someone is able to be an idealist because of support from others in the form of financial assistance (paying bills, hiring bodyguards). Step 4: Evaluate the relationship between the two sentences. - Given that the main ideas/themes between the two sentences are consistent, we can say that Sentence 2 is a simplified version of Sentence 1 with less specificity (does not mention bodyguards, and does not use \\"preachy\\"). Step 5: Decide if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. - Based on the analysis, the second sentence captures the main theme of the first sentence but is less specific.

Afterwards, a shunned cheerleader named Bambi is seen fawning over Grange's locker before the on-field celebration pours into the locker room. As a group of cheerleaders are cleaning up the field after the game, all five are skewered with a javelin thrown by an unknown assailant. The bizarre murder makes headlines, as does a subsequent murder involving exploding pompons. As a result, the college's summer cheerleading camp is closed down. In 1982, the camp reopens with Bambi as the instructor. After arriving on campus, she meets Pepe the maintenance man and his mother Salt, both of whom warn her against reopening the camp as they believe it to be cursed with death, but Bambi is undeterred.

No. The information provided, \\"The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han,\\" does not directly address the question, \\"In what year did Huo Guang die?\\" There seems to be no correlation between the two facts presented. Huo Guang was a noteworthy Chinese politician during the Western Han Dynasty. He played a critical role after the death of Emperor Wu, achieving the position of regent to multiple child emperors, and was even granted the title of emperor posthumously by one of them. But his year of death is not connected in any apparent way with the information provided about specific monopolies during certain years. Huo Guang died in the year 68 BC, which we know from historical records. He had an influential political career and historians often credit him for his commitment to maintaining the Western Han dynasty's power and prosperity during times of potential instability. As a regent, Huo Guang was able to manage palace intrigue, navigate complicated political dynamics, and maintain order while serving under several emperors. Huo Guang's influence waned only slightly after his death, as his wife, children, and later his relatives continued to control Han politics until the downfall of the dynasty. But his death in 68 BC marks the end of his personal contribution to this influential period in Chinese history. Therefore, the information about the duration of the liquor monopoly and the eventual abolition of the salt and iron monopolies during the early Eastern Han does not correlate or provide a suitable answer to the question of when Huo Guang died.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 17*t = 46*t + 51*t + 800 for t. Solve this problem.","completion":"This problem might look a little tricky, but let's break it down! First, we have a pretty big number problem. We have 17 times a mystery number (t), and that is supposed to be equal to 46 times the mystery number plus 51 times the mystery number plus 800. So first, we want to add those two \\"times mystery number\\" parts together, the ones on the right side of the equal sign! When you add 46t and 51t together, you get 97t. Our problem now looks like this: 17 * t = 97 * t + 800 But the \\"t\\" is on both sides of the equal sign. That's a bit pesky! If we want to find out what the mystery number is, we need it to be only on one side. We can do that by subtracting 97t from both sides of our equation. But look, 17 is less than 97, so we will get a negative number on the left side. When we subtract 97t from 17t, we get -80t. Our equation now looks like this: -80 * t = 800 To solve for \\"t,\\" we need to divide both sides by -80. Just like with our subtraction, we need to do the same thing to both sides to keep things balanced. So when we divide 800 by -80, we get -10. So this means that \\"t,\\" or our mystery number, is -10!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

As the surfer wearing a wet suit continues to interact with the curious and playful seal, the ocean around them begins to show signs of an approaching set of waves. The two surfers exchange glances, knowing that they cannot miss the opportunity to harness the energy of these beautiful swells. With a brief look of gratitude and appreciation towards their newfound marine friend, the wetsuit-clad surfer decides to seize the moment. Positioning himself perfectly on his surfboard, he starts paddling towards the incoming wave, feeling the adrenaline coursing through his veins. He is determined to make the most of this perfect day in the water. As he begins to match the speed of the wave, he takes one last look over his shoulder at the now seemingly content seal, who seems to understand that his human playmates must return to the game they truly love - riding the waves. With a powerful and practiced motion, the surfer pops up onto his feet, smoothly transitioning onto the face of the wave as it starts to break. The ocean spray engulfs him as he carves his board through the turquoise water, fully immersed in the thrilling experience. The seal, left behind by the surfer's agile movements, watches on with what almost seems to be a knowing smile, appreciating the display of human athletic prowess. While the second surfer waits for the next wave, still awestruck by the amazing encounter with the friendly seal, the moment serves as a humbling reminder of the importance of sharing the wonders of the ocean with all its majestic creatures. Ultimately, this adventure excellently demonstrates the unique relationship we can have with the natural world and the importance of respecting and cherishing these relationships, not just for ourselves but for the mutual benefit of the ecosystems we share. The surfer's farewell to the seal represents the delicate balance between enjoying our time in nature while acknowledging that the environment exists for the coexistence of all its inhabitants."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Which sample would have lower concentration of hydronium ions, sample A or sample B? In his chemistry lab David is learning about acids. He took three solutions to identify them correctly, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a strong acid; sample B is a weak acid; and sample C is not an acid. David needs to identify the content of each sample by learning about their attributes. Hint: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is.

As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Strong acids typically have a higher concentration of hydronium ions and thus a lower pH value in comparison to weak acids.

If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied... Now, I have a new situation: Two farmers provide a neighboring city with plenty of produce every year. Brick farm has a lot of plant problems, their plants experience abiotic stress.

Portsmouth had been issued with a winding-up petition by HM Revenue and Customs on 3 January, freezing the club's bank accounts. The administrator will be Trevor Birch of PKF, a firm with a track record of dealing with clubs in administration. Portsmouth had asked the court to appoint Andrew Andronikou, who oversaw the club's last administration two years ago, and is currently handling the same process with Pompey's parent company. The administration order enables Portsmouth to access their bank accounts and continue trading while Birch, who was proposed as administrator by HMRC, searches for new owners. In a statement, HMRC said it had been concerned about a possible conflict of interest had Andonikou been appointed. The statement continued: \\"HMRC is pleased that the Court agreed with our view that the creditors of any business have a right to expect that the administrator in these circumstances is completely independent.\\" Mr Birch said he hoped the club's supporters would also be happy to see a new face in charge. \\"The intention is to try and sell the club as a going concern,\\" he said. \\"I'm used to dealing with clubs in crisis. You could say most of the Championship is in crisis, with 30% of clubs paying wages in excess of 100% of their turnover. \\"You have to travel hopefully and confidently. Maybe the new appointment will encourage someone to come out of the woodwork and bid [for the club].\\" During the hearing at the High Court, it was revealed that Portsmouth currently owe around £2m to business creditors, as well as a similar sum to the Inland Revenue in unpaid tax. By going into administration other opportunities will come up for investors, who would have been reluctant to buy the club with a winding-up order hanging over it Among those creditors are fellow football clubs West Bromwich Albion, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Bristol City, as well as the Football League itself. Portsmouth City Council is owed £78,000. It also emerged electricity and gas suppliers have been threatening to cut off power to the club's Fratton Park stadium for non-payment. And, although Pompey are set to be docked 10 points for going into administation, they could lose further points at the discretion of the Football League as a result of it happening for the second time in such a short period of time. Remarkably, this is the third time Portsmouth have gone into administration in recent years. The club also went into administration in December 1998, prior to being taken over by the Serbian businessman Milan Mandaric. Pompey then became the first Premier League side to enter administration in February 2010, following which they were relegated to the Championship. Going into administration for a second time in such a short period was \\"disappointing\\" but the only way the club could go forward, according to Portsmouth North MP Penny Mordaunt. \\"By going into administration other opportunities will come up for investors, who would have been reluctant to buy the club with a winding-up order hanging over it,\\" she said. Earlier this week it emerged Portsmouth had received their parachute payment from the Premier League early, however, chief executive David Lampitt told BBC Radio Solent it would be up to the administrator how money in Pompey's bank account - understood to be around £2.5m - is spent. Pompey's parent company, Convers Sports Initiatives, entered administration in November, forcing the Championship club to search for new owners. CSI administrator Andronikou then revealed that Pompey had missed two tax payments of £800,000 to HMRC. It later emerged they currently owe HMRC £1.9m in unpaid tax as well as between £4m to £7m from the previous regime. The club announced in January that their players and staff had not been paid their wages for that month, as a result of having their bank account frozen. They later failed to gain a validation order to gain access to their accounts, leaving players and staff at Fratton Park still waiting to be paid. Former owner Balram Chainrai last week said he was flying to the UK to sort out the stricken club's future. The Hong Kong-based businessman, who owned the club with Israeli Levi Kushnir through a company called Portpin, is still owed £17m. BBC South understands that any new purchaser would need to provide £12m as proof of funds, and assurances they could meet another £20m in repayments to former creditors, Chainrai and Alexandre Gaydamak. However, the Portsmouth Supporters' Trust have claimed that Andronikou is asking them to provide £100m in proof of funds before any meeting between them could take place. In a statement issued after the Administration order was confirmed, the PST said it believed the time had come for the club to be owned by the 'city and community'. \\"A new model of ownership should be developed which will make sure the shameful events of the past few years are not repeated. Pompey fans never want to see their club in court in these circumstances again.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the financial crisis at Portsmouth Football Club, which has led the club into administration for the third time in recent history, jeopardising its position in the Championship league just above the relegation zone. Portsmouth's bank accounts were frozen after they received a winding-up petition from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on January 3. The appointed administrator is Trevor Birch from PKF, a firm known for managing clubs in administration. Initially, the club requested the court to appoint Andrew Andronikou, who had overseen a previous administration. However, HMRC was concerned about a potential conflict of interest and suggested Birch for better impartiality. Entering administration allows Portsmouth to access their bank accounts and continue trading while Birch searches for new owners. This move was seen as a way to attract investors who might have been hesitant to buy the club due to the previous winding-up order. Among the creditors, Portsmouth owes around £2 million to businesses and a similar sum to Inland Revenue in unpaid tax. Fellow football clubs like West Bromwich Albion, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Bristol City are also creditors, along with Portsmouth City Council and even basic service providers like electricity and gas companies. Persistent financial issues led to the club receiving their parachute payment from the Premier League early. However, it was up to the administrator to decide how to spend the money in their bank account, which was approximately £2.5 million. The article also mentions that Portsmouth's parent company, Convers Sports Initiatives, entered administration in November, and the club still owed HMRC £1.9 million in unpaid taxes. Notably, staff and players had not received their wages for the month due to the frozen bank account, creating a tense situation. The article concludes, mentioning that the Portsmouth Supporters' Trust wants a new ownership model to prevent a repeat of the recent financial difficulties. They believe the club should be owned by the city and the community. However, they claimed that Andronikou was asking them to provide £100 million in proof of funds before discussions could commence."},{"prompt":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

In the story, the carpenter John Hill made a dining table for the writer's wife and presented them with a bill that totaled 36.50.

The returned Jamie also reminds her that he also irritated her, and as a ghost he manifests behaviours she'd have little patience for – turning up the central heating to stifling levels, moving furniture around and inviting back \\"ghost friends\\" to watch videos. This infuriates her, and their relationship deteriorates. She meets Mark, a psychologist, to whom she is attracted, but she is unwilling to become involved with him because of Jamie's continued presence. Nina continues to love Jamie but is conflicted by his self-centred behaviour and ultimately wonders out loud, \\"Was it always like this?\\" Over Nina's objections, Jamie decides to leave to allow her to move on. Towards the end of the film, Jamie watches Nina leave and one of his fellow ghosts asks, \\"Well?\\" and Jamie responds, \\"I think so... Yes.\\" At this point the central conceit of the movie has become clear: Jamie came back specifically to help Nina get over him by tarnishing her idealised memory of him., can you guess it ?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, the first name of the person that is attracted to Mark is Nina."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: This article: Anthony Field and Jeff Fatt were members of The Cockroaches, a Sydney pop band known for their \\"good-time R&B material\\" and several singles recorded by independent labels during the 1980s. In 1988, Field's infant niece, who was the daughter of Cockroaches founder and band member Paul Field, died of SIDS, and the group disbanded. Anthony Field enrolled at Macquarie University in Sydney to complete his degree in early childhood education, and later stated that his niece's death \\"ultimately led to the formation of [The] Wiggles\\". Murray Cook, also \\"a mature-aged student\\", was the guitarist in the pub rock band Bang Shang a Lang before enrolling at Macquarie. Greg Page, who had been a roadie for and sang with The Cockroaches during their final years, had enrolled in Macquarie to study early childhood education on Field's recommendation. Field, Cook, and Page were among approximately 10 men in a program with 200 students.In 1991, while still a student, Field became motivated to use concepts in the field of early childhood education to record an album of music for children. The album was dedicated to Field's niece. A song he wrote for The Cockroaches, \\"Get Ready to Wiggle\\", inspired the band's name because they thought that wiggling described the way children dance. Like a university assignment, they produced a folder of essays that explained the educational value of each song on the album. They needed a keyboardist \\"to bolster the rock'n'roll feel of the project\\", so Field asked his old bandmate Fatt for his assistance in what they thought would be a temporary project.The group received songwriting help from John Field, Anthony's brother and former bandmate, and from Phillip Wilcher, who was working with the early childhood music program at Macquarie.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? . Financial discipline is a vital aspect of financial independence. The ultimate goal is living within your financial means, both short- and long-term. Pay attention to the ways you’re spending money. Perhaps the most important aspect of preparing yourself to become financially independent is ensuring that you are not spending more than you’re making. Fortunately, there are several methods to track your spending: Use a ledger or a spreadsheet. The manual approach is great way to start, as it makes you keenly aware of every expense. Whatever you use, the act of entering every expense into a database of your expenses will keep you better informed of your own spending patterns. Use free accounting software. Once you have multiple bank accounts, and different types of income and expenditures, your ability to organize the corresponding information may demand more than your spreadsheet skills can handle. Online platforms such as Personal Capital and Mint are free and immensely helpful. For more specific advice, see How to Manage Your Money Wisely. With an eye towards making immediate improvements in your financial behavior, evaluate how you spend most of your money. There are everyday expenses many people often overlook that can hamper your ability to live within your financial means. Because a handful of expenses consume most of your budget, pursue these first and minimize common types of spending. Minimize rent or mortgage payments. Choose your home based on the cost of living in the area. Go for as little home as you’re comfortable in — both when buying or renting. Consider purchasing a duplex and renting out one side or renting out rooms in your home. Reduce your reliance on vehicles. Vehicles not only diminish the quality of our environment, they are also associated with substantial financial costs. Walking, biking, and taking the bus will reduce your spending immediately. Clothing, food, and leisure are areas in which many people spend far more than is appropriate, given their income. Remember that even everyday decisions regarding your method of transportation or eating habits can be the difference between overspending and being able to begin saving for financial independence. Buy what you can used. Thrift stores and craigslist offer high quality items for only a fraction of what they would cost new. Do it yourself. From home repair to vegetable gardening, you can save money (and increase your worldly wisdom) by taking matters into your own hands. There’s also an undeniable sense of satisfaction fixing something yourself or growing the ingredients to make yourself a salad from your own yard. Understand that debt does not necessarily prevent you from becoming financially independent. Also recognize that you don’t need to pay it off as quickly as possible. Pay off debt steadily, but within your ability to do so while achieving financial stability. Most importantly, do not take on unnecessary debts. When paying off debt, start with high-interest debt, like credit cards and auto loans, before paying off student loans. Don’t take on new debt. Your education is a reasonable expense to take out loans for, as it is an investment in yourself. Even a car loan can be justifiable if it is the only way you can afford to buy a vehicle. Continually increasingly credit card debt, however, is blatantly irresponsible. Not only is taking on new debt a clear sign that you are not living within your means, continually acquiring debt will ensure that you are unable to achieve financial independence. Never finance a vacation, new clothes, or even unnecessary food purchases with a credit card. A good rule to follow: only take on debt for investments, not for lifestyle. If you've compiled a large amount of debt and are struggling to improve your financial position, see How to Negotiate Your Personal Debts.

Help as much as you can. Definition: In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3. Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Input: Question: How many years did Diederik Samsom serve as Leader and Parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives? Passage 1:In early 2011, the contracts of three young FC Spartak Moscow players (Maksim Grigoryev, Dmitri Malyaka and Yevgeni Filippov) expired, and they decided to switch to FC Rostov. According to Russian football regulations, when a player under 23 years of age who was raised in the club system transfers to a different club after his contract expires, his old club is due compensation from his new club. If the new club plays on the third level (Russian Second Division), the compensation is the player's 5 previous years' salary multiplied by 1, if his new club is in the National League Championship, it's multiplied by 2 and if it's a Russian Premier League club, it's multiplied by 3. The three players signed with a Russian Second Division team FC MITOS Novocherkassk who immediately loaned them to the Russian Premier League team FC Rostov. Spartak lodged a complaint with the Russian Football Union, claiming this was not a fair transfer as the only reason for it was to lower the compensation that FC Rostov was due to pay Spartak. After the protest was declined on 29 March 2011, Grigoryev was registered for FC Rostov and scored a goal on his debut against FC Lokomotiv Moscow on 2 April 2011, the game ended with a score of 1–1. FC Lokomotiv's president, Olga Smorodskaya, filed a complaint with the Russian Football Union and Premier League, claiming Grigoryev was not eligible to be registered and play for FC Rostov. Before the protest was heard, Grigoryev scored a goal in Rostov's 2-1 victory over FC Dynamo Moscow in the 2010–11 Russian Cup quarterfinal. The protest was heard by the RFU's Dispute Resolution Chamber on 21 April 2011. Smorodskaya insisted that FC MITOS did not have the transfer certificate from Spartak in their possession before the transfer deadline and therefore could not have legally registered Grigoryev. The protest was declined as, according to the league, Grigoryev et al. were registered with RFPL before the transfer deadline, even though they were not included on the official rosters on the league's website or in any other sources. The official league website actually still lists the date of their registration as 1 April. In another twist, in January 2012, Lokomotiv signed Grigoryev from FC MITOS. In March 2012, Court of Arbitration for Sport began considering Grigoryev's case. CAS made their decision in May 2012, denying Lokomotiv's appeal. Passage 2:After the election of 2006 Plasterk was appointed as Minister of Education, Culture and Science in the Cabinet Balkenende IV, taking office on 22 February 2007. The Cabinet Balkenende IV fell on 20 February 2010 after tensions in the coalition over the extension of the Dutch involvement in the Task Force Urozgan of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan and continued to serve in a demissionary capacity until the Labour Party cabinets members resigned on 23 February 2010. Plasterk was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives after the election of 2010, taking office on 17 June 2010 serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Finances. After the Leader of the Labour Party and Parliamentary leader of the Labour Party in the House of Representatives Job Cohen announced that he was stepping down as Leader and Parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives following increasing criticism on his leadership, Plasterk announced his candidacy to succeed him. Plasterk lost the leadership election to fellow frontbencher Diederik Samsom on 16 March 2012. After the election of 2012 Plasterk was appointed as Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations in the Cabinet Rutte II, taking office on 5 November 2012. Plasterk took a medical leave of absence from 29 June 2016 until 16 September 2016 during which Minister for Housing and the Central Government Sector Stef Blok served as acting Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. On 10 September 2016 Plasterk announced announced his retirement from national politics and that he wouldn't stand for the election of 2017. The Cabinet Rutte II was replaced by the Cabinet Rutte III following the cabinet formation of 2017 on 26 October 2017. Passage 3:A military flying school was set up at the site of the present-day RAAF base on 28 August 1916, when the area was known as Ham Common. RAAF Station Richmond was established on 30 June 1925 as the fledgling service's first air base outside Victoria. Its initial flying unit was No. 3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, operating Airco DH.9 light bombers and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 fighters, and for the next decade the commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron was also in charge of the base. Among these were Squadron Leaders Frank Lukis (1925–30), Harry Cobby (1930–31), and Bill Bostock (1931–33). Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond was formed as a separate entity on 20 April 1936, under the command of Group Captain Adrian \\"King\\" Cole. Other units, including No. 22 Squadron flying Hawker Demons, and No. 2 Aircraft Depot, had been established in the preceding months. No. 4 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron was formed in May 1937, followed by No. 6 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron in March 1939. Two Fleet Cooperation units were also established, No. 5 Squadron in April 1936 and No. 9 Squadron in January 1939. No. 23 (General Purpose) Squadron formed in February 1939. As well as an Air Force base, in its pre-war days Richmond was used as a supplementary airport for Sydney; various aviation pioneers employed it in the 1930s, including Charles Kingsford Smith and Jean Batten.

Article: Much has been said and written recently about heroes, mainly because many people think we have too few of them. There are many different kinds of heroes, but they all seem to have two things in common. First, heroes, by their actions, show the great possibilities of human nature. Second, heroes can also stand the test of time, and their achievements will not be easily forgotten. Because of these good points, we need to choose our heroes carefully. Olympic sports star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who is believed to be a hero, warns young people to be careful of making athletes heroes. She hopes that if someone tries to copy her, it will be because she has achieved her goals by working hard. Joyner-Kersee says that a hero should be someone who has an influence on another person's life. Poet Maya Angelou believes that a hero encourages people to treat others well and to be concerned about the greater good. A hero should show politeness, courage, patience, and strength all the time. A hero should encourage others to follow him with actions that improve the world, even if only in small ways. Author Daniel Boorstin suggests that, \\" _ are people who make news, but heroes are people who make history.\\" Thus, if a person is truly worthy to be called a hero, he or she will not be soon forgotten. We all need heroes. We need to be able to respect people who have been there, done that, and succeeded. Many times the greatest heroes are the people we deal with every day -- relatives , friends, and neighbors -- who will keep going when it is easier to give up. The parent who puts her or his family ahead of herself or himself, the teacher who will make more money at another job but chooses to help others -- all these people can be considered as heroes. A hero quietly and continuously sets a good example, an example that inspires others to follow. Question: Joyner-Kersee hopes that young people _ .

In developing their Far East trade, the Dutch also began to frequent the island.

I didn't go when it first came out because, well, frankly, I was afraid. Afraid of how bad it might be, or how disappointing. While not as bad as Menace, and better than Clones, it wasn't particularly memorable, or satisfying. I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience I'll never forget. A timeless story of the bored farm-boy who just knows he was meant for more, saving the princess and the Galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard, the rogue pirate and the various comic relief--all in a space-opera setting. And that's not to chastise Lucas for using an old formula. It's an old formula precisely because it works. And to his credit, he gave it new twists that made it very special. Then came Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. Darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time. The great villain, Vader was Luke's father. Wow, no one saw that coming. Of course, I'm convinced neither did Lucas till it showed up in the screenplay. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, particularly in light of the first three episodes, see if it really meshes. Which brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is an entertaining movie--tremendous effects, plenty of action, some good fighting scenes. But a movie still lives or dies on its plot--the story it is telling. Oh, certainly, really good acting can save a weak plot, but a weak plot coupled with bad acting--that's a burden no director can overcome, certainly not one as bad as I'm forced to realize George Lucas is (The man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors--Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). *****SPOILERS AHEAD******** The plot. Oh my. Understand, he's already handicapped by what's happened in the first two films so it's an incredible burden. One too much for him to overcome. First we have the sheer absurdities of the background. We have Anakin being found as a child on Tatooine, the product of a virginal, miracle birth--the \\"chosen one\\". Well, this detail never gets remotely explained. Indeed, the closest explanation is Yoda's observation that maybe they were wrong. Oh, well, okay then. Our mistake. Now, this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence that is. And he'll come back to Tatooine and never know he was from there? Wow! How about that. Testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there, eh George? Anyway, we have this bratty kid, moody, petulant, whining young adult, who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in Cinematic history--the great tragedy of Darth Vador--the good guy who falls from grace, only to finally achieve redemption in the end. How, pray tell, does this happen? Why, he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. Now, sure, he lives in a star-spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline, but does it occur to the \\"dark one to be\\" to maybe check with a physician cause maybe, just maybe, this futuristic society might can do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they've been chasing for two films tells him that he's got the secret to immortality. Well, of course he does. Sheesh. How can Lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it? How can anyone expect us to care? Hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place. I wanted Kenobi to kill him not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid. Oh, by the way, Amidala finally dies. In childbirth. Why? Well, they don't know. The doctor, who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced, offers only the conclusion of \\"she's lost the will to live\\". Well, oh, okay, of course she has. Maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with. But here we are. We have Kenobi present for all this. He knows of the birth of Luke and Leia. Knows who their father is and knows what happens to them. Knows, also, the role of both R2 and C3PO. And yet, in several years, as Luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3PO and R2 (curiously, 3PO's mind is wiped, but not R2's--why????) stating \\"I think these droids belong to you\\", Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be \\"the chosen one\\" and apprentice to the Emperor himself, and who just happened to be built on this very planet, says \\"strange, I don't recall owning any droids\\". Oh good grief. Lucas simply made this up as he went along. Once he introduced VAder as Luke's father, sadly, the story began spinning out of control because HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE STORY WAS. The plot of Episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine did made any rational sense at all. And none of this ties into the story he originally told in Star Wars. It's an afterthought, and it looks it. I can't give this movie a high rating. It reminds me of Triple X. A fun film to watch, but entirely forgettable. Star Wars will stand in my mind forever.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

If you can't find golden syrup at your local grocery store, consider buying it online. Otherwise, substitute an equal amount of honey. Use a small bowl or cup. Mix together the boiling water and the baking soda to form a paste. Use the back of a metal spoon to crush any lumps in the baking soda. If you leave the lumps, they may not mix into the dough properly. If you're worried about lumps in your baking soda, sift the baking soda into the cup or bowl before adding water. Immediately spoon the baking soda and water mixture into the melted butter and golden syrup. Use a whisk to completely incorporate the ingredients. Keep stirring until a layer of white foam forms on the surface of the mixture. Turn off the heat. If the mixture begins boiling, reduce the heat. Otherwise, you may burn the butter. Pour the butter mixture directly into the dry ingredients. Use a baking spatula or spoon to scrape the sides of the saucepan clean. Next, use a large spoon to gently mix everything together. Continue to stir until the mixture is uniform. The dough will cling to the spoon and the sides of the bowl but hold its shape. If your dough is too dry, add a few drops of water. If your dough is too wet, sprinkle in some flour. Many people believe that Anzac biscuits are best when freshly baked. However, if you're preparing a large batch of biscuits ahead of time, you can freeze the dough for up to three months. To do so, lay out a large sheet of plastic wrap. Next, spoon the dough onto the plastic wrap in a long line. Roll the plastic wrap around the dough to create a log of biscuit dough and place it in the freezer When you're ready to bake the biscuits, simply cut off small disks of frozen biscuit dough from the log with a serrated knife. Let the log thaw for an hour or two before slicing it. Summary:","completion":"We are making a yummy treat called Anzac biscuits. First, mix rolled oats, flour, sugar, and coconut in a big bowl. Then, melt butter and golden syrup (or honey) in a small pan on low heat. In another small bowl, mix boiling water and baking soda to make a paste. Add this paste into the melted butter and golden syrup. Mix it well. Pour this butter mix into the big bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently stir until the dough is ready. You can make the dough into biscuits now or freeze it to bake later. When you want to bake them, cut small pieces from the frozen dough and let them thaw before cooking.

Answer the following question: where is the subsolar point on december 21?","completion":"On December 21, the subsolar point, which is the location on Earth where the Sun appears to be directly overhead at solar noon, is situated at the Tropic of Capricorn. This phenomenon occurs during the December Solstice, which represents the point where the Earth's axial tilt is farthest away from the Sun within the Southern Hemisphere. The Earth's axial tilt, at approximately 23.5 degrees, causes the variation in the subsolar point's location throughout the year. This tilt results in different regions of the Earth receiving varying amounts of sunlight during the course of a year, leading to the creation of seasons. To be more precise about the location of the subsolar point on December 21, the Tropic of Capricorn is an imaginary line of latitude located at approximately 23.5 degrees south. Its name is derived from the fact that, over 2,000 years ago, the December Solstice occurred when the Sun was in the constellation Capricornus. Due to the precession of the equinoxes, this is no longer the case, but the name Tropic of Capricorn has persisted. During the December Solstice, the areas lying between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle experience a period when the Sun never sets, referred to as the \\"midnight sun.\\" Meanwhile, regions between the Tropic of Capricorn and the equator experience their summertime, characterized by longer daylight hours and shorter nights. Conversely, the regions between the equator and the Tropic of Cancer experience their wintertime, with reduced daylight hours and longer nights. Areas between the Arctic Circle and the Tropic of Cancer receive the shortest amount of daylight on this day. In conclusion, the subsolar point on December 21 is at the Tropic of Capricorn, approximately at 23.5 degrees south latitude. This event marks the beginning of astronomical summer in the Southern Hemisphere and astronomical winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the subsolar point travels between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn throughout the year, causing variation in the amount of sunlight received by different regions and the subsequent changes in seasons."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Context: Quinn had waited all summer for it to be warm enough to go to the pool.

Using three separate microphones, Caul and his associates follow the couple around a park. Later, he pieces together a conversation that clearly indicates the two are in a relationship and that they fear being found out by the Director.Caul is a secretive, almost paranoid individual. He alienates his assistant, Stan (John Cazale), because he won't teach him more about audio surveillance, and his girlfriend, Amy (Teri Garr), because he won't share with her details about his career or personal life. He also refuses to hand over the tapes of Ann and Marc to the Director's assistant, Martin (Harrison Ford). The Director had specified that the tapes were to be turned over only to him. Martin protests but Caul keeps the tapes.Caul becomes increasingly concerned that, were he to turn the tapes over to the Director, that some harm would come to Ann and Marc. On the tapes, Marc can be heard to say \\"He'd kill us if he had the chance.\\" When he worked on the East Coast, Caul had participated in a surveillance that led to the deaths of two persons. He worries that this might happen again, and goes to church to confess his sins.After Amy breaks off their relationship, Caul attends a surveillance convention. Martin also attends, and Caul confronts him and orders Martin to stop following him. He learns that Stan has gone to work for Moran (Alan Garfield), a Detroit-based surveillance expert looking to expand to the West Coast. Moran demonstrates to convention goers a new remote audio system that turns any telephone into a live microphone. Although Caul persuades Stan not to work for Moran after the convention is over, Moran is effusive in his praise for Caul. Lonely and enjoying the positive attention, Caul lets his guard down and takes Moran, Stan and several others back to his workroom for a post-convention...

The premise: \\"A young boy jumps in a swimming pool towards a bald man in the water.\\" The hypothesis: \\"A kid jumps in the pool close to a man.\\" In this case, we can break down the premise and the hypothesis to evaluate the given information. From the premise, we can extract the following information: 1. There is a young boy involved. 2. The young boy jumps in a swimming pool. 3. The direction of the jump is towards a bald man. 4. The bald man is in the water. From the hypothesis, we can extract the following information: 1. There is a kid involved. 2. The kid jumps in the pool. 3. The jump occurs close to a man. Comparing the two, we see that: 1. The young boy and the kid refer to the same person in this context. Both the premise and hypothesis mention the kid/young boy jumping into the pool. 2. The premise and hypothesis both agree that the jump occurs in the swimming pool. 3. The premise specifies a bald man in the water, while the hypothesis refers more generally to a man. However, as the bald man is still a man, we can reasonably infer that the jump occurs close to a man according to the premise. Considering these points, we can conclude that the information provided by the premise supports the hypothesis as true. The premise tells us that a young boy jumps in the swimming pool towards a bald man in the water, thereby corroborating the hypothesis, which is essentially a simplified version of the events stated in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use evidence from the fact that as the thickness of an object increases , the resistance to damage of that object will increase to answer this question: \\"To protect yourself from blisters you may try\\"","completion":"To protect yourself from blisters, it is necessary to utilize the principle where as the thickness of an object increases, the resistance to damage of that object also increases. This concept can be put into practice in several ways. First, wearing thick socks can significantly protect your feet from blisters. The thicker material not only absorbs more shock but also offers more cushioning compared to thin ones, reducing the friction between your skin and the shoe. When there is excessive friction, the outer layers of skin can separate and fill with fluid, forming a blister. Thicker socks can prevent this by reducing direct skin-to-shoe contact. Second, using shoe inserts or insoles can provide an extra layer of protection against blisters. These inserts increase the thickness between your feet and your shoes, effectively distributing pressure more evenly across the foot and minimizing the rubbing that leads to blisters. Some inserts or insoles even have specific padding or gel cushioning meant to alleviate pressure spots that more commonly lead to blisters. Third, consider using patches or tapes in areas prone to blisters. If you're going on a long hike, for instance, and know that your boots often rub a specific part of your foot, preemptively applying a patch or tape to provide an added layer of skin can prevent the creation of a blister. Products such as adhesive bandages, molefoam, or specially designed blister bandaids can be used. Fourth, using products like blister prevention sprays or creams can support on this matter. While they do not increase the thickness of your skin directly, they create a sort of barrier that prevents rubbing and reduces the heat caused by friction - two things vital for the formation of blisters. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that an effective measure is making sure your shoes fit properly in the first place. Shoes that are too tight or too loose will increase friction, as the shoe material will constantly rub your skin while you're moving. So, through a combination of thicker socks, shoe inserts, preemptive use of patches or tapes, blister sprays or creams, and ensuring a proper shoe fit, one can effectively apply the principle that an increase in thickness equates to an increase in resistance to damage - in this case, to prevent the formation of painful blisters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question. Which word is used to describe any rock or soil material that has remained below zero degrees centigrade continuously for more than two years?","completion":"The term used to describe any rock or soil material that has remained below zero degrees centigrade continuously for more than two years is \\"permafrost.\\" Permafrost is derived from two words: \\"permanent\\" and \\"frost,\\" which together convey the meaning of permanently frozen ground. Permafrost can be found in regions with cold climates, such as the polar regions, high mountain areas, and vast territories across the northern parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Approximately 25% of the Earth's land surface is estimated to be underlain by permafrost. This phenomenon plays a vital role in shaping the ecological and hydrological dynamics of these cold environments. Permafrost can be categorized into two main types: continuous and discontinuous. Continuous permafrost is observed in areas with extremely cold temperatures, where the ground remains frozen all year round without any unfrozen patches. Discontinuous permafrost, on the other hand, refers to areas where the frozen ground is interspersed with unfrozen zones, typically found in regions characterized by milder temperatures. The thickness of permafrost layers can vary greatly, ranging from less than a meter to several hundred meters in depth. Factors such as temperature, snow cover, vegetation, and soil type can influence the development and stability of permafrost. Permafrost has significant environmental implications. As global temperatures increase due to climate change, permafrost has begun to thaw in various parts of the world. The melting of permafrost can lead to the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, stored within the frozen ground. This release can further exacerbate global warming and contribute to a feedback loop of climate change effects. Additionally, the thawing of permafrost can destabilize structures and infrastructure built on or near the frozen ground, such as roads, pipelines, and buildings, leading to costly damage and maintenance challenges. Moreover, the alteration of permafrost landscapes can impact local ecosystems by changing the distribution of plant and animal species, as well as modifying the hydrological cycle. In summary, permafrost refers to any rock or soil material that has remained below zero degrees centigrade continuously for over two years. Primarily found in cold climate regions, permafrost greatly influences the environmental, ecological, and human infrastructure aspects of these areas. The ongoing effects of climate change have made permafrost an important topic of study, as the consequences of its thawing pose significant challenges and implications for the global environment and human societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

TEXT:I hate to sound like an 'old person', but frankly I haven't seen too many movies that I like that were made after 1960... generally, movies just seem to get worse and worse (although I quite enjoyed the Scott Baio vehicle \\"The Bread, My Sweet\\", except for the 'de rigeur' sex scene which added NOTHING of value to THAT movie). This movie makes the mother, a former Las Vegas chorus girl, seem to be incapable of surviving on her own, although she is clearly in her 50s (though hinted at being in her 40s). I didn't buy it. I'm 57 and like all the women I know in their 50s and 40s, more than capable of surviving on my own (as I have been doing since I graduated from high school at 13, got legally emancipated and set off on my own life's journey.) The daughter is not believable in her job role ... she gets a promotion she doesn't deserve (a great opportunity) and drops that ball too, but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver, the writers shoot her down as an 'opportunist', when she was just doing what any career-oriented person would do -- taking advantage of a wide-open opportunity created by the lack of self-discipline of her coworker, a girl who apparently doesn't understand the concept of honoring her promises (to her boss, in this case). The daughter grudgingly 'allows' her mother to stay with her, on a temporary basis, but then treats her mother (the woman who gave her Life and raised her to 'adulthood') like a pariah. Apparently the 'writers' of tripe like this do not understand that it is NOT 'the common thing' for PARENTS to act like children, and then be treated AS children by THEIR children. That is just more of the societal 'baloney' that Hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we, their public, were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings. This is a sad movie with a stupid ending. If the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two-dimensional 'tv character', he'd have stayed with the MOTHER, who was not that much older than him and quite attractive. But in the end he 'falls' for the daughter, a shallow, rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth, but in an ordinary, bland way. (The 'opportunist' young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive, physically.) There was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter (who was an uptight, selfish, self-centered b*tch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect) to the mother -- a woman who was kindhearted, sweet-tempered, humorous, and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend. Of course the mother had her own flaws... she had reacted to her husband's demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter.

Q: Infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the major economically important poultry diseases distributed worldwide. It is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and affects both galliform and nongalliform birds. Its economic impact includes decreased egg production and poor egg quality in layers, stunted growth, poor carcass weight, and mortality in broiler chickens. Although primarily affecting the respiratory tract, IBV demonstrates a wide range of tissues tropism, including the renal and reproductive systems. Thus, disease outcome may be influenced by the organ or tissue involved as well as pathotypes or strain of the infecting virus. Knowledge on the epidemiology of the prevalent IBV strains in a particular region is therefore important to guide control and preventions. Meanwhile previous diagnostic methods such as serology and virus isolations are less sensitive and time consuming, respectively; current methods, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), and sequencing, offer highly sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic results, thus enabling the genotyping of new viral strains within the shortest possible time.

Question: What are some of the most interesting tourist destinations in the city? Context: Nanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, and had been the world's largest city aggregately for hundreds of years, enjoyed peace and prosperity and beared wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu, one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period (211-280); the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern Dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317-589; the Southern Tang, one of the Ten Kingdoms (937-76); the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368-1421); and the Republic of China (1927–37, 1945–49) prior to its flight to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1851–64) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940–45) during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and suffered appalling atrocities in both conflicts, including the Nanjing Massacre. It has been serving as the capital city of Jiangsu province after the China was established, and is still the nominal capital of Republic of China that accommodates many of its important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Art Museum. Answer:","completion":"There are numerous interesting tourist destinations in the city of Nanjing, largely due to its historical importance as one of the ancient capitals of China. These sites reflect its rich tapestry of history served by different states and dynasties. Firstly, the city has key heritage sites like the Presidential Palace and the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. The Presidential Palace was the office for the Presidents of the Republic of China before they moved to Taiwan. On the other hand, the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum is the final resting place of the first president and founder of the Republic of China, remarking the modern history of China. Then, there are historical landscapes like Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, and Drum Tower, all of which bear the mark of different periods in Chinese history. The Fuzimiao, also known as the Confucius Temple, for instance, was originally constructed in the year 1034 during the Song Dynasty. Ming Palace was an imperial palace complex, built as the royal palace of the Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the Ming Dynasty. Chaotian Palace is a complex of palace buildings, and it's the largest preserved traditional Chinese architectural complex in Jiangsu province. Two notable structures are the Porcelain Tower, considered one of the wonders of the world, and the Drum Tower, which dates back to the Ming dynasty. The city also has natural attractions like the Qinhuai River, the Xuanwu Lake, and Purple Mountain. The Qinhuai River is the birthplace of the age-old Nanjing culture. As for the Xuanwu Lake and the Purple Mountain, both offer serene environments away from the bustling city life. Finally, yet importantly, Nanjing is also home to key cultural facilities. For instance, the Nanjing Library is the third largest library in China and the Nanjing Museum and Art Museum also offer rich collections showcasing the depth and breadth of Chinese history and culture.

Q: Which process involves solvent separation on a solid medium? A: Choose from: (A). substration. (B). resonance. (C). affinity. (D). chromatography. Answer:","completion":"Answer: (D). chromatography Chromatography is a versatile and widely used separation technique, which involves the separation of a mixture of compounds, also known as solutes, based on their distribution between a mobile phase (a solvent or a mixture of solvents) and a stationary phase (a solid medium). The process aims to separate these compounds based on their differential affinity towards these two phases. The mobile phase moves through the stationary phase, and the individual components of the solute mixture are selectively retained by the stationary phase to different extents, resulting in their relative separation. In the given context, chromatography is the process that involves solvent separation on a solid medium. The other options provided do not fit the description of the process: (A). Substration: This term could be a misinterpretation of \\"substrate,\\" which refers to a substance or surface upon which an enzyme or another catalyst acts. It does not involve any solvent separation on a solid medium. (B). Resonance: Resonance is a concept in chemistry and physics in which two or more atomic or molecular structures act compositely through electron delocalization. This term is not related to the process dealing with solvent separation on a solid medium. (C). Affinity: Affinity generally refers to the attraction or repulsion between two bodies or entities. While the selective retention of solutes in chromatography is based on their affinity towards the stationary phase, affinity itself is not a process that separates solvents on a solid medium.

The premise suggests that it is beneficial for young boys to have a relationship with their fathers, but it does not specifically clarify the term \\"relationship,\\" so it can be interpreted differently based on an individual's perspective. The hypothesis, on the other hand, posits that boys with their fathers in their lives tend to be more well-rounded individuals. If we break down the premise and hypothesis, there are some common threads. Both statements emphasize the importance of a father figure in the lives of young males. The premise specifies that it is a \\"wonderful advantage,\\" which implies that boys who have relationships with their fathers may have some benefits that other boys who lack such relationships do not have. The hypothesis, on the other hand, focuses on the idea of \\"roundedness.\\" This term can be interpreted in various ways, such as emotional stability, social skills, or general personal development. The term \\"roundedness\\" could very well relate to the \\"wonderful advantage\\" mentioned in the premise. In this case, having a father figure may contribute to a boy's well-rounded development. However, there are also several unknowns that prevent us from definitively asserting the relationship. The premise does not elaborate on why or how a relationship with a father is advantageous. Furthermore, there may be other factors at play, such as the quality or type of relationship a boy has with his father. Moreover, since the premise does not explicitly discuss how this advantage leads to well-rounded development, we cannot make a concrete conclusion based on this information alone. In summary, the premise and hypothesis, while sharing some common ground, do not provide enough explicit evidence to confirm that boys grow up to be more well-rounded individuals when their fathers are in their lives. It is essential to consider other factors, such as the nature of the father-child relationship and the specific ways in which fathers contribute to the lives of their sons. With more information, it might be possible to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not, but based on the given statements alone, it is not possible to tell."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose water is not contained by a dam happens, how will it affect DEGRADED safety from flooding. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"A: more If water is not contained by a dam during a flooding event, it will likely lead to more significant safety concerns and increased flood damage. Dams are designed to regulate and control the flow of water, helping to prevent downstream flooding. Without a dam to hold back the excess water and release it gradually into the river system, the risk of flooding would be much higher, leading to more significant safety concerns and potential harm to people and property in the affected areas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After being forced to punt on their first offensive drive, the Colts' defense forced a fumble that was recovered by Ricky Jean-Francois and set up the Colts inside Titan territory. After a 37-yard pass from quarterback Andrew Luck to T. Y. Hilton set the Colts up at the one yard line, Trent Richardson scored on the next play, putting the Colts up 7-0. An onside kick gave the ball back to the Colts, which led to an eleven play, 44-yard drive that ended in a touchdown pass from Luck to Dwayne Allen. The Colts' defense again forced a turnover on the Titans' next possession, with Charlie Whitehurst throwing an interception to Mike Adams. Luck and the Colts' offense again drove down the field, though this time having to settle for a field goal, extending the lead to 17-0. Tennessee scored their first points midway through the second quarter on a Ryan Succop. The Colts responded on their next possession with a 30-yard field goal from Adam Vinatieri. A Luck interception late in the half, set up the Titans in Colts' territory and allowed them to score on a pass from Whitehurst to Delanie Walker, cutting the Colts' lead to 20-10 at halftime. The Colts' scored on their first offensive possession of the second half, on a 28-yard touchdown pass from Luck to Reggie Wayne and then later in the quarter on a pass from Luck to Coby Fleener, extending the Colts' lead to 34-10. Tennessee responded with an eight play, 80-yard drive that ended with a touchdown run from Bishop Sankey. Luck completed his fourth touchdown pass of the game early in the fourth quarter, this time on a 15-yard pass to Ahmad Bradshaw, giving the Colts a 41-17 lead. Late in the game, Adams again forced another turnover, with Zach Mettenberger throwing the interception. During the game, Reggie Wayne caught seven passes for 119 yards and one touchdown, which was enough to move him to seventh on the NFL all-time receptions list and tenth on the most receiving yards list. With the win, the Colts improved to 2-2. How many times did the titans score in the first half?","completion":"In the first half, the Tennessee Titans scored twice.

Article: The sun line, also known as the Apollo line, is a vertical line that's usually located near the bottom of your palm underneath your ring finger. If you have a deep sun line, you may be very successful and possibly gain fame. A shallow line means you're still developing your skills and you'll work hard toward success. If the sun line is broken, you may gain success after overcoming past obstacles. The relationship line, also called the marriage line, is a small horizontal line that wraps around the side of your palm underneath your pinkie. Relationship lines that are long or deep might mean you prefer long-term commitments, while short or shallow lines mean you may experience multiple relationships or revisit old commitments. You may have multiple relationship lines on your palm, which may mean you are passionate in your romantic relationships. Your intuition line is a curved line that starts near the bottom of your pinkie and goes down toward your wrist. If your intuition line is pronounced, you may be able to pick up on how others are feeling quickly and sense if they're positive or negative. When you have breaks in your intuition line, it could mean you're empathetic for others, but you should focus on your own mood and emotions. You may not have an intuition line on your palm, but you can still be empathetic and sense others' feelings. The health line is a diagonal or curved line that starts from the edge of your palm by your pinkie and extends down to the center of your wrist. Having a long, deep health line can mean that you're a supportive individual and that you take care of others. Not everyone will have a health line, but it does not mean that you don't care for other people. Breaks in your health line may represent illnesses you or a loved one may have had in the past. The money line is a short diagonal line that extends down from the base of your pinkie.

Article: April 2009, in the state of Georgia, USA, twenty thousand people watched high school students from twenty- eight countries compete with robots they had built. More than ten thousand students and more than five hundred robots took part in the competition. Almost 1,700 high school teams took part in the competition called LUNACY. In January, the organization sent the same robots to each team. The teams had six weeks to build robots that could compete in the LUNACY game. The playing area consisted of six robots, three on each team. Each robot had a trailer connected to it. The robots had to pick up large balls and throw them into the trailers of opposing robots. The robots were moving on a platform where they could move smoothly. A team from the USA won the LUNACY competition. American inventor Dean Kamen started the competition in 1989 to increase young people's interest in science and technology. The organization holds robotic competitions around the world. It offers programs that help young people learn about science, technology, engineering and maths, and at the same time build life skills. Many companies provide support for the organization. Mr. Kamen says the goal is more than building robots. He says the student competitors showed they could solve difficult technological problems and, he says that it is good news because the world needs creative thinkers to solve the increasingly difficult problems of the future.

Article:Lallana's former Southampton team-mate scored a trademark free-kick in Wales' 2-1 win against Slovakia and has dominated the pre-match build-up. Asked whether the aura around Bale, 26, would affect England, Lallana said: \\"I know that won't affect me or our team. \\"We've got plenty of players with that aura and special talent.\\" Lallana, 28, who came through the youth system at Saints with Bale, added: \\"I don't believe that will come into play at all.\\" Bale has been outspoken in the run-up to a game that carries huge significance after England only drew 1-1 in their opening game against Russia, claiming Wales had more \\"passion\\" than Roy Hodgson's side. \\"I'm sure he didn't mean it in too serious a manner, knowing Gareth,\\" said Lallana. \\"It's part and parcel of the build-up. We know that we will do our talking on the pitch like I believe they will want to do. The match can't come soon enough for me. \\"Maybe they want to spice things up before a big game but we're all used to that. It is about not getting lured into it.\\" And rather than being intimidated by Bale, Lallana believes England possess the attacking threat to strike fear into the Welsh. England had Leicester City's title-winning inspiration Jamie Vardy, who scored 24 goals in their Premier League triumph on the bench in the draw against Russia, along with Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge and 18-year-old Marcus Rashford, who made such a big impression in his first season in the first team at Manchester United. Harry Kane, the Premier League's top scorer with 25 goals for Tottenham last season, played against the Russians with England captain Wayne Rooney moved to a deeper role to accommodate Hodgson's range of attacking options. Lallana said: \\"I think they'll definitely be thinking about that. Anyone would who is playing against us and looking at our team - not just our team but our squad. There are attacking players on the bench we can use and there are great options there.\\" \\"It's definitely one of the best England squads I've been involved in, so if someone is having a bad day, or there are injuries or suspensions, we've got options in abundance to come in and keep the standards high.\\" So should Wales be worried about England? \\"I think they will be and will be doing their preparation to try and stop us,\\" said Lallana. Wales are two points ahead of England after the first round of games, Chris Coleman's side opening with victory against Slovakia while Hodgson's side conceded a last-minute equaliser against Russia in Marseille. And Lallana admits these results mean England go into the game as the team under greater pressure. \\"Yes that's the case but we thrive on pressure week in and week out,\\" he said. \\"It brings out the best in us.

Answer the following question: Information: - David Harbater (born December 19, 1952) is an American mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania, well known for his work in Galois theory, algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry. - \\"Not to be confused with his wife Michèle Raynaud, who is also a French mathematician working in algebraic geometry.\\" - The term proposition has a broad use in contemporary philosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the primary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other \\"propositional attitudes\\" (i.e., what is believed, doubted, etc.), the referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of declarative sentences. Propositions are the sharable objects of attitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This stipulation rules out certain candidates for propositions, including thought- and utterance-tokens which are not sharable, and concrete events or facts, which cannot be false. - In abstract algebra , Abhyankar 's conjecture is a 1957 conjecture of Shreeram Abhyankar , on the Galois groups of algebraic function fields of characteristic p. The soluble case was solved by Serre in 1990 and the full conjecture was proved in 1994 by work of Michel Raynaud and David Harbater . The problem involves a finite group G , a prime number p , and the function field of nonsingular integral algebraic curve C defined over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic p. The question addresses the existence of Galois extensions L of K ( C ) , with G as Galois group , and with restricted ramification . From a geometric point of view L corresponds to another curve C , and a morphism : C C. Ramification geometrically , and by analogy with the case of Riemann surfaces , consists of a finite set S of points x on C , such that restricted to the complement of S in C is an étale morphism . In Abhyankar 's conjecture , S is fixed , and the question is what G can be . This is therefore a special type of inverse Galois problem . The subgroup p ( G ) is defined to be the subgroup generated by all the Sylow subgroups of G for the prime number p. This is a normal subgroup , and the parameter n is defined as the minimum number of generators of G / p ( G ) . Then for the case of C the projective line over K , the conjecture states that G can be realised as a Galois group of L , unramified outside S containing s + 1 points , if and only if n s. This was proved by Raynaud . For the general case , proved by Harbater , let g be the genus of C. Then G can be realised if and only if n s + 2 g. - Algebra (from Arabic \\"\\"al-jabr\\"\\" meaning \\"reunion of broken parts\\") is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. As such, it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra, the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians. - In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, an algebraic structure is a set (called carrier set or underlying set) with one or more finitary operations defined on it that satisfies a list of axioms. - In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate is . An example in three variables is . - In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers , , and satisfy the equation for any integer value of greater than 2. The cases and have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity. - In abstract algebra, field extensions are the main object of study in field theory. The general idea is to start with a base field and construct in some manner a larger field that contains the base field and satisfies additional properties. For instance, the set Q(2) = {\\"a\\" + \\"b\\"2 | \\"a\\", \\"b\\" Q} is the smallest extension of Q that includes every real solution to the equation \\"x\\" = 2. - In mathematics, more specifically in the area of modern algebra known as Galois theory, the Galois group of a certain type of field extension is a specific group associated with the field extension. The study of field extensions and their relationship to the polynomials that give rise to them via Galois groups is called Galois theory, so named in honor of Évariste Galois who first discovered them. - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - In mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, Galois theory, named after Évariste Galois, provides a connection between field theory and group theory. Using Galois theory, certain problems in field theory can be reduced to group theory, which is, in some sense, simpler and better understood. - The University of Pennsylvania (commonly known as Penn or UPenn) is a private, Ivy League university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Incorporated as \\"The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\\", Penn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities and one of the nine original colonial colleges. - Évariste Galois (25 October 1811 31 May 1832) was a French mathematician born in Bourg-la-Reine. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel. - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words \\"hypothesis\\" and \\"theory\\" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research. - In algebra, which is a broad division of mathematics, abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras. The term \\"abstract algebra\\" was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from the other parts of algebra. - In mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof has been found. Conjectures such as the Riemann hypothesis (still a conjecture) or Fermat's Last Theorem (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them. - Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros. - In mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part . It was proposed by , after whom it is named. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.

One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is the HMSÂ Bounty. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is William Bligh (Charles Laughton), and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The Bounty leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable), the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam (Franchot Tone) is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian. During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of Tahiti, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take home, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti (William Bambridge), and his daughter, Tehani (Movita Castaneda), and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his one-day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti (Mamo Clark). Christian promises her he will be back someday.

The two questions you have presented are different from each other, both in terms of their subject matter and their specific inquiries. The first question, \\"How can someone deposit old notes in a no-frill account and how?\\" pertains to the financial domain, specifically banking. It is asking about the process of depositing old banknotes into a no-frill account. No-frill accounts, or no-frills accounts, are basic banking accounts that offer essential services without any additional fees or features. They are intended to provide affordable banking services to individuals who may not have access to traditional bank accounts. The question specifically addresses old banknotes, which may be out of circulation or no longer considered legal tender. The process of depositing these old notes may vary depending on the country and its currency laws. The second question, \\"How do I study all Java packages in months?\\" relates to the field of computer programming. Java is a popular programming language, and packages in Java refer to organized collections of related classes and interfaces (a set of methods and properties). Studying Java packages means acquiring knowledge about these different sets of classes and interfaces for practical use in programming. The question asks for guidance in learning all Java packages within a specific time frame—months in this case. This might involve coursework, tutorials, online resources, and self-guided projects.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Why are people interested in eating raw foods or whole foods ? One reason is that eating these types of food reduces the risk of acid accumulation in your body. Raw and whole foods are usually digested more efficiently than cooked foods. When we cook foods, we destroy the natural enzymes that are part of the food in its raw form. These enzymes were intended by nature to help us digest the food. When we consume food without these natural enzymes, our bodies either digest the food improperly or allow too many nutrients to be absorbed into the bloodstream. In both instances, the result is overweight. When too many nutrients are absorbed at once, the body grows fat. Improperly digested food moves slowly through the digestive system, where it becomes increasingly acidic. To protect its vital organs from this acidic waste, the body changes the acid into fat and stores it safely away from the organs. Processed foods contain chemical elements, which might confuse the appetite mechanism that tells us when we've had enough to eat; as a result, people often overeat. Processed foods also upset the digestive cycle. The body will either identify these foods as allergens and then store them safely away from the organs as fat, or the remains of undigested food will become acidic and enter the bloodstream as acid waste, which will stick to the blood vessel walls and block the passage of vital oxygen and nutrients heading for the body's cells. The body's metabolism becomes inactive, and the result is weight gain and obesity. The accumulation of acid in the digestive system makes digestion increasingly inefficient. When that happens, even healthy foods can become acidic and the food allergies will become more common. To stop this vicious circle in its tracks, people need to consume food and supplements that will neutralize the acid already accumulated in body. Eating the right types of raw and whole foods can help. It's also important to restore your enzyme balance. You need to identify and avoid the foods that cause... Question: It can be inferred from Para. 2 that _ .

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which fruit retained their quality longer apples or pears? Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend. Mary decided to candy the fruit, while Ann decided to eat them fresh, Mary received plums, peaches, apples and oranges. Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries. Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] The answer to this question is:","completion":"Apples retained their quality longer. Step-by-step justification: 1. Mary received apples, among other fruits, and decided to candy them. 2. The candying process involves placing fruit in heated sugar syrup, which preserves it. 3. This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year. 4. Ann received pears and decided to eat them fresh. 5. Fresh pears typically have a shorter shelf life compared to candied fruit. 6.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows? ? Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.

The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. This law is also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states the energy available after a chemical reaction is always less than that at the beginning of a reaction. This is also commonly referred to as entropy. Entropy can be described as the degree of disorder in a system . That is, as energy is transferred from one form to another, some of the energy is lost as heat, and the amount of available energy decreases. As the energy decreases, the disorder in the system increases, and, by definition, the entropy increases. Ice melting provides an example in which entropy increases. Entropy essentially is a measure of the tendency of a process, such as a chemical reaction, to proceed in a particular direction.

She and her chaperone, Miss Wiggin, visit the publishing house of Harold and Fruing Warne, who decide to publish her book. Beatrix is thrilled and returns home, taking a drive through the parks to celebrate first. However, it is revealed the Warne brothers think her book is ridiculous and will no doubt be a failure. The only reason they agreed to publish it is because they promised their younger brother, Norman, a project. When Norman Warne visits Beatrix, they make decisions about her book regarding size, colour and price. Norman admits he has never done anything like this before but has given her book a great deal of thought. Beatrix realises what Norman's brothers have done regarding him and her, but they become determined to prove them wrong.

Maria knew how much Jessica loved skiing and had been looking forward to this trip. However, Maria also recognized that health should always come first. When Jessica shared her condition with Maria, Maria immediately sympathized with her because she knew that ear infections can be quite painful and uncomfortable. Experiencing such an ailment would undoubtedly make participating in any sort of physical activity rather unenjoyable, so Maria could comprehend why Jessica had to prioritize healing over skiing. Additionally, Maria was concerned about the impact that skiing in cold temperatures might have on Jessica’s ear infection. She had read that exposing oneself to the chilly air and high altitudes while skiing could potentially worsen an ear infection, prolonging the healing process and exacerbating the pain. This was another reason why Maria was understanding when Jessica informed her that she couldn't go skiing today. Maria even offered to help Jessica with whatever she needed to recover from her ear infection as quickly as possible. She suggested that they could spend the day inside, resting and watching movies instead. Maria also said she would accompany Jessica to a doctor if necessary, to ensure that she was receiving proper medical care.

His army had succeeded in a temporary increase of French power in Egypt, though it faced repeated uprisings. In early 1799, he moved an army into the Ottoman province of Damascus (Syria and Galilee). Bonaparte led these 13,000 French soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of Arish, Gaza, Jaffa, and Haifa. The attack on Jaffa was particularly brutal. Bonaparte discovered that many of the defenders were former prisoners of war, ostensibly on parole, so he ordered the garrison and 1,400 prisoners to be executed by bayonet or drowning to save bullets.

Powell contended that it was not inconsistent to want to foster cooperation even with an organization like the Indonesian military, which has a history of human rights abuses. \\"If you get young officers, expose them to a military organization that is within a democratic political institution, such as the United States, then that rubs off on them,\\" he said. In Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981. The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Powell had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities. His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized. The United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political rivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants, including some who may be linked to al-Qaida, without trial. Powell said his discussions with Mahathir \\"touched on the case\\" of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is serving a 15-year sentence on charges of sodomy and abuse of power after trials that Powell said the United States had \\"always felt\\" were flawed. The assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, James Kelly, met on Tuesday morning with Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, for what she later told Malaysian reporters was a discussion about both the detention of her husband and six supporters, and the campaign against terrorism.

Options: (a). yes; (b). it is not possible to tell; (c). no;","completion":"(c). no; The premise states, \\"Just as though we didn't count,\\" which suggests that something is being considered as if it were not counted or taken into account. On the other hand, the hypothesis states, \\"It's as if we count considerably,\\" which implies the opposite: that something is being counted or considered in a significant way. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as they express contradictory ideas. Additionally, there is not enough information given to determine if the premise could result in the hypothesis under different circumstances, so option (b) is also incorrect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Syntactically, the sentence is well-formed as it follows the general structure of English sentences and proper grammatical rules. It consists of a subject (Heidi), a verb (thinks), a complement clause that introduces new information (that pictures of herself are beautiful), and a predicate adjective within the complement clause (beautiful). In terms of semantics, the sentence makes logical sense and conveys a clear meaning. It expresses that Heidi holds a belief or opinion that the pictures in which she appears are beautiful.

Bolten watched the exchanges and, after what he called \\"a quiet moment,\\"suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order. Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out.\\" Once again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft. In the apt description of one witness, \\"It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.\\" Eventually, the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter.

Answer the question...most runs in england vs australia series 2018??","completion":"In the England-Australia cricket series held in 2018, the top scorer across both teams was England's Jonny Bairstow, who scored the most runs in the series. The 2018 England vs. Australia cricket series, which took place in June, consisted of five One Day International (ODI) matches. England won the series 5-0, registering a clean sweep against Australia. Throughout the series, several players showcased exceptional performances, but Jonny Bairstow stood out as the leading run-scorer. Over the course of the five ODI matches, Bairstow scored a total of 300 runs at an impressive average of 60. He opened the innings for England, providing them with a powerful start in each game and setting the platform for the middle-order batsmen to capitalize on. His highest individual score in the series was 139, which came off just 92 balls in the third ODI match held at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. This knock included 15 fours and 5 sixes. The series witnessed several other notable performances, such as Alex Hales, Shaun Marsh, and Jos Buttler, all contributing significantly to their respective teams.

The rundown of recommended stories on some popular Chinese social media sites showed nothing extraordinary this week until users looked a little more closely. On the Sohu Weibo platform for example, the characters on the homepage had been arranged to read \\"Hang in there, Southern Weekly,\\" but only if read vertically, from top down. Another site, 163.com, structured its homepage in a way that the first character of the top six rows of news combined to read \\"Go Southern Weekly Go!\\" They were referring to the wave of anger this week against alleged government censorship at the Southern Weekly, a newspaper based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. For two days, journalists at the paper and hundreds of their supporters have gathered in front of the Southern Weekly offices holding posters calling for free speech and condemning press censorship. \\"This is an attack and suppression of press freedom and the people's right to know the truth. It is not right,\\" said one unnamed protester. \\"I came over here to say the Southern Weekly is not alone,\\" explained another. Some of the mostly young protesters carried flowers as a symbol of grief, while one woman came with a face mask plastered with Chinese characters explaining it was a \\"biyantao,\\" or a condom to prevent speech. They demanded the resignation of Tuo Zhen, the Communist Party propaganda chief in the southern province of Guangdong, amid claims that an editorial calling for political reform was re-written as a tribute to Communist Party rule. This rare protest poses a test for Xi Jinping, the newly installed Communist Party chief, who is just beginning to define his agenda as the paramount leader governing a massive country in a state of flux. It also represents a serious dilemma for the Communist Party in an era of social media and micro-blogging. It started with a posting on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media site, complaining that the Propaganda Department in southern Guangdong province had rewritten the paper's annual New Year's editorial without the knowledge of the editors. It was originally titled \\"China's Dream of Constitutionalism,\\" but when it was printed it was revised to read \\"Chasing the Dream,\\" which echoed the official Communist Party line. The censors also added text that contained factual errors. Soon enough China's social media witnessed a torrent of postings condemning Party censorship and supporting the Southern Weekly. The controversy brings to light the role of propaganda czars who supervise the flow of information in China. To be sure, Chinese media has become more diverse in the past three decades, thanks to China's gradual reforms and opening up. Over the years, the local press has been given a bit more room to report about different topics and to do so differently, especially on non-political issues. But government censorship has never stopped and most media groups are still owned and run by the state. The Propaganda Department regularly issues written or oral directives about what news should or should not be reported and how this should be done. So one can only imagine the frustrations editors and journalists endure when faced with censorship. The Southern Weekly is not new to censorship-related controversy. Over the years, it has shown a liberal leaning. Within the allowed space, it produces stories that are relatively fresh, probing and even daring. \\"Some of our essays, exposes and muck-raking stories have tried to push the margin,\\" said a former reporter, who requested anonymity. \\"We call them 'edge-ball' stories, just like playing table tennis, when you make points not with hard smashes but with slight, subtle hits.\\" For that, some of its editors and reporters have gotten into trouble with the propaganda czars. For that, too, it has earned respect and attracted a loyal following, especially among the youth, urbanites, and intellectuals. On Friday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying insisted there was no press censorship in China and the government protects press freedom according to the law. But there are apparent attempts to rein in the media, especially popular micro-blogging services, which are used to expose problems and abuses that may embarrass the government. Meanwhile, search terms related to Southern Weekly are being blocked. Just how big a threat the demonstrations pose to Xi's new regime remains unclear. It is also unclear where Xi stands on the issue of press censorship and free speech. Some analysts wonder whether Xi or the central government supported the actions of Guangdong officials. Some blame the row squarely on Tuo Zhen, the newly appointed provincial propaganda chief. One observer in Guangdong blamed his \\"behavior and work style\\" for causing the row. But others see the controversy as bigger than just the Guangdong Propaganda Department versus the Southern Weekly. \\"It is a publicity crisis for Xi Jinping's new administration,\\" said Xiao Qiang, a founder and editor-in-chief of China Digital Times, a U.S.-based site monitoring China's Internet and media issues. \\"Its political credibility and ability to lead is now being tested. \\"When the top leadership seems not resolute and clear, a smaller event moves into the national public sphere, and the state even just slightly loses control of the message in the media and Internet space.\\" For the Global Times, however, the message is clear. \\"No matter how the Chinese media is regulated, they will never become the same as their Western counterparts,\\" the government-backed media group said in an editorial. \\"This should be the basic judgment of Chinese media professionals. \\"China's political system differs from the West's, and the media cannot separate itself from a country's political reality. The only way that fits the development of Chinese media is one that can suit the country's development path.\\" According to the China Digital Times, the Central Propaganda Department has issued an urgent directive telling media groups at all levels that:. -- State-run media is an unswerving basic principle. -- The \\"mishap\\" at Southern Weekly has nothing to do with Guangdong propaganda chief Tuo Zhen. -- The incident's development is due to the \\"meddling by hostile forces\\" The directive told all editors, reporters and staff to discontinue voicing their support for the Southern Weekly and ordered all media sites to prominently republish the Global Times editorial. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The article highlights a wave of anger against alleged government censorship at the Southern Weekly, a newspaper based in Guangzhou, China.

Answer choices: - our nearest star - varied temperatures - tides - humidity - global warming - flow of electrons - gravity - Physical weathering","completion":"A planet rotating causes varied temperatures on that planet. It is important to understand the various factors and processes involved in creating different temperatures on a planet, along with other related phenomena. A planet, which rotates on its axis, experiences temperature variations throughout its surface due to the distribution of sunlight received. The light emitted by the nearby star, which acts as the primary source of energy, delivers varying amounts of heat to different regions, based on their position relative to the star and the rotational axis. As a result, the answer choice related to the initial statement is: varied temperatures. However, it is worth discussing how a rotating planet may correlate to other answer choices mentioned, even if they are not directly caused by the planet's rotation. 1. Our nearest star: While a rotating planet may have its nearest star, it does not cause that star. Stars and planets are formed within stellar nurseries, and their relative distances from each other are the result of complex spatial dynamics and gravitational interactions. 2. Tides: Although the rotation of a planet indirectly affects tides, tides are primarily caused by the gravitational interaction between a planet and its celestial neighbors, such as moons or other nearby celestial bodies. 3. Humidity: Humidity is influenced by a combination of factors, including temperature and the presence of water on a planet's surface. Although the rotation-driven temperature variation plays a role in humidity, it does not solely cause it. 4. Global warming: Global warming is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, in a planet's atmosphere. While the rotation of a planet can create conditions that influence the rate of global warming, the rotating action itself does not cause it. 5. Flow of electrons: The flow of electrons in an electrical current is not related to the rotation of a planet. This flow occurs based on differences in charge or in response to an electromagnetic field, which are not inherently connected to planetary rotation. 6. Gravity: A planet's gravity is generated by its mass, not its rotation. However, a planet's rotation may result in the variation of the experienced gravitational force due to the centrifugal effect, creating a difference in the strength of gravity at the equator versus the poles. 7. Physical weathering: While the process of physical weathering can be influenced by temperature fluctuations resulting from the rotation of a planet, the actual cause of physical weathering is attributed to the forces exerted by natural elements, such as water, ice, and wind. In summary, a rotating planet causes varied temperatures on its surface due to the uneven distribution of sunlight. Although some of the other answer choices have connections to planetary rotation, such as altering tides or affecting physical weathering, they are not directly caused by the rotation itself."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: HOw long was Iraq a British mandate Context: In 1922, Egypt, which had been declared a British protectorate at the outbreak of the First World War, was granted formal independence, though it continued to be a British client state until 1954. British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone. In return, Egypt was assisted to join the League of Nations. Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arab and Jewish communities. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly revolted in 1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of the Arab population in the Middle East as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency. Answer:","completion":"The context states that Iraq was a British mandate since 1920 and it gained independence from Britain in 1932. Therefore, Iraq was a British mandate for 12 years. Step 1: Read the question and understand what information is needed. Step 2: Read through the context carefully, looking for the relevant information related to the question - in this case, the duration of Iraq being under British mandate. Step 3: Found the line \\"Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932.\\" This line gives us the start (1920) and end year (1932) of the mandate.

Paragraph: Enterotropic strains of routine coronaviruses (MHV-Y and MHV-RI) differ extensively in their pathogenesis from the prototypic respiratory strains of murine coronaviruses. In an effort to determine which viral proteins might be determinants of enterotropism, immunoblots of MHV-Y and MHV-RI virions using anti-S, -N and -M protein-specific antisera were performed. The uncleaved MHV-Y and MHV-RI S proteins migrated slightly faster than the MHV-A59 S protein. The MHV-Y S protein was inefficiently cleaved. The MHV-Y, MHV-RI and MHV-A59 N and M proteins showed only minor differences in their migration. The S genes of MHV-Y and MHV-RI were cloned, sequenced and found to encode 1361 and 1376 amino acid long proteins, respectively. The presence of several amino acids changes upstream from the predicted cleavage site of the MHV-Y S protein may contribute its inefficient cleavage. A high degree of homology was found between the MHV-RI and MHV-4 S proteins, whereas the homology between the MHV-Y S protein and the S proteins of other MHV strains was much lower. These results indicate that the enterotropism of MHV-RI and MHV-Y may be determined by different amino acid changes in the S protein and/or by changes in other viral proteins.

Article: BEIJING, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- Commander-in-chief of China's manned space program Chang Wanquan announced Thursday night that the launch of Tiangong-1 space lab module is successful. China's first space lab module Tiangong-1 blasted off at 9:16 p.m. Beijing Time (1316 GMT) Thursday from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest desert area. The unmanned module, carried by Long March-2FT1 rocket, will test space docking with a spacecraft later this year, _ the way for China to become the third country in the world to operate a permanent space station around 2020. The Tiangong-1 will orbit the Earth for about one month to await Shenzhou-8 unmanned spacecraft. Once the two vehicles successfully rendezvous , they will conduct the first space docking at a height of 340 kilometers above Earth surface. After two docking tests, Tiangong-1 will await Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-10 in the next two years, according to a plan of China's manned space program. The 8.5-tonne Tiangong-1, with a length of 10.4 meters and maximum diameter of 3.35 meters, provides a room of 15 cubic meters for two to three astronauts to live and work. Zhang Shancong, deputy chief designer of the Tiangong-1, told Xinhua that the module carries special cameras which will take hyperspectral images of China's vast farmlands to detect heavy metal pollution and pesticide residue as well as plant disease. Moreover, scientists on the ground will also conduct experiments on photonic crystal , a new material expected to revolutionize information technology, in the low-gravity environment inside the Tiangong-1 as these experiments would be extremely difficult to conduct on Earth's surface. \\"China is clearly becoming a global power and its investments in areas like technology and space exploration reflect this,\\" said Peter Singer, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. \\"It is a natural result of the growth in political and economic power and is to be expected,\\" said Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's manned space program,... Question: Tiangong-1 will do the following things in the future Except that it will _ . Options: A: test space docking with a spacecraft later this year. B: detect pollution and pesticide residue and disease. C: provides a room for astronauts to live and work. D: operate a permanent space station. The answer is:","completion":"D: Operate a permanent space station. Although it was mentioned in the article that China has the ambition to operate a permanent space station around 2020, there was no explicit mention of Tiangong-1 being the vessel to fulfill this role. Option A: This statement is verified in the article as it indicates that the Tiangong-1 \\"will test space docking with a spacecraft later this year\\", setting China on the path to join other world powers in advanced space operations. Option B: This is confirmed by the reference to the special cameras on Tiangong-1 that will be used to detect heavy metal pollution, pesticide residue and plant diseases. This scientific and environmental surveillance task is one of the intended functions of the Tiangong-1 module. Option C: The article affirms that Tiangong-1 provides a room of 15 cubic meters for two to three astronauts to live and work, enabling human occupancy and activities in space. Therefore, after careful review of the article and the answer options given, it can be concluded that Tiangong-1 does not have the future role of \\"operating a permanent space station,\\" making option D the suitable answer to the question. However, it is significant to note that this does not downplay China's aspirations towards possessing a permanent space station as a step up in their space program.

Jordan isn't allergic, so he is able to get his tooth pulled after an anesthetic is injected. Who will not experience a disruption of ion movement in their cell membranes? Hint: When you go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled, you really don’t want to feel any pain. The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off. Answer:","completion":"Jordan will not experience a disruption of ion movement in his cell membranes during the tooth extraction procedure. This is because he receives an anesthetic injection, which interferes with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. By disrupting the ion movement, nerve impulses are not transmitted, and as a result, Jordan will not sense pain during the procedure.

If Republicans are able to regain control of the Senate while retaining their majority in the House in November, they will have two years to inflict significant damage on the administration's agenda and set the terms of debate for the 2016 election. In the 1998 midterm elections, OPTIONS: - Americans defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - CNN defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Congress defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Democrats defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - GOP defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - House defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Julian Zelizer defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Obama defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Republicans defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Senate defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Zelizer defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House.","completion":"In the 1998 midterm elections, Republicans defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. This rare occurrence served as a reminder that not all midterm elections follow the conventional wisdom. In 1998, several external factors had contributed to these surprising results, including a strong economy and popular backlash against the impeachment process of then-President Bill Clinton. Additionally, Democratic campaigns successfully focused on key issues such as education, healthcare, and social security, which resonated with voters at the time. The 1998 midterm elections also illustrated that no party should take their voters for granted or assume that historical trends will guarantee success. Candidates must continuously demonstrate their commitment to addressing the needs and concerns of their constituents in order to secure their support. More broadly, these elections underscored the importance of staying attuned to the political landscape and being responsive to the issues that matter most to the general public. As we fast-forward to the present-day, President Obama's administration faced the realities of the 2014 midterm elections, where Republicans indeed regained control of the Senate while retaining their majority in the House. This shift in power had several significant implications for the president's second term agenda. Legislative initiatives, such as criminal justice reform, climate change measures, and proposals related to taxes and spending, faced increased opposition from a Congress dominated by Republicans. These obstacles made it more challenging for the administration to advance various policy priorities and left a lasting impact on Obama's presidential legacy. Moreover, the 2014 midterms set the stage for the 2016 presidential election, with Republicans framing the political debate. Issues such as immigration, healthcare reform, and national security became major points of contention, forcing Democratic candidates to respond accordingly. Ultimately, the lessons learned from past midterm elections dictated the importance of voter engagement, staying focused on key issues, and never underestimating the potential for surprises in the ever-changing political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Artists such as Liquid Liquid, the B-52s, Cristina, Arthur Russell, James White and the Blacks and Lizzy Mercier Descloux pursued a formula described by Luc Sante as \\"anything at all + disco bottom\\". The decadent parties and art installations of venues such as Club 57 and the Mudd Club became cultural hubs for musicians and visual artists alike, with figures such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Michael Holman frequenting the scene. Other no wave-indebted groups such as Swans, Glenn Branca, the Lounge Lizards, Bush Tetras and Sonic Youth instead continued exploring the early scene's forays into noise and more abrasive territory. What did Downtown Manhattan's no wave scene transition into?","completion":"Downtown Manhattan's no wave scene in the early 1980s transitioned from its abrasive beginnings into a more dance-oriented sound that melded various musical styles and influences. This new direction was characterized by a playful sensibility, resulting from the fusion of hip hop, disco, punk, dub reggae, and world music influences. Compilations such as ZE's Mutant Disco (1981) showcased this emerging sound and approach. Several artists from this period pursued a formula described by Luc Sante as \\"anything at all + disco bottom,\\" which entailed combining unconventional or experimental elements with a disco-inspired rhythmic foundation. Key figures in this transitional phase included Liquid Liquid, the B-52s, Cristina, Arthur Russell, James White and the Blacks, and Lizzy Mercier Descloux. This period witnessed a flourishing of creativity not just in music but also in the arts and social scene. Venues such as Club 57 and the Mudd Club became cultural hubs where musicians and visual artists mingled, collaborated, and exchanged ideas. Influential artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and Michael Holman were regulars in these spaces, contributing to the vibrant creative atmosphere. At the same time, some groups continued to explore the no wave scene's initial focus on noise and more abrasive soundscapes. Artists like Swans, Glenn Branca, the Lounge Lizards, Bush Tetras, and Sonic Youth drew inspiration from no wave's roots, pushing boundaries and experimenting further with atonal and dissonant musical elements. Thus, the Downtown Manhattan no wave scene evolved into a multifaceted, genre-blending movement that left a lasting impact on the subsequent generations of artists and musicians."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: Animal rights activists circulated photos of the husband and wife team behind Cafe Gratitude and Gracias Madre eating a burger and keeping freezer full of beef The California-based husband and wife founders of celebrity-endorsed vegan restaurant group Cafe Gratitude say they have received death threats after it was revealed last week that they are raising, slaughtering and eating animals on their farm north of San Francisco. Matthew and Terces Engelhart, both in their sixties, who opened the first Cafe Gratitude in 2004 and whose celebrity followers have included Gwyneth Paltrow, Beyoncé and Sacha Baron Cohen, countered the firestorm of criticism with a defense of the “regenerative agriculture” methods they now use on their Be Love Farm in Vacaville, calling it a personal choice made in the privacy of their home. You can't be 'a little bit vegan' Read more “We started to observe nature and what we saw is that nature doesn’t exist without animals,” Matthew Engelhart told the Hollywood Reporter last week after animal rights activists dug up and circulated blog entries from spring 2015 from the farm’s website, including photos of a freezer full of pastured beef, jars of gravy and Matthew enjoying a hamburger, with posts on their “transition” into meat products after nearly 40 years of vegetarianism. “People have taken up the mob mentality,” he opined, after protesters gathered outside their restaurants holding signs such as “no animal is grateful to die”, started a Facebook boycott page and frantically posted one-star Yelp reviews. “Cows make an extreme sacrifice for humanity but that is their position in God’s plan as food for the predators,” Matthew Engelhart added in a statement about their decision. “We can be part of that sacrament.” Terces Engelhart tends to the animals at Be Love Farm in this photograph from April 2011. The farm supplies produce to the Engelharts’ restaurants. Photograph: Adithya Sambamurthy for the Guardian But purist vegans who patronized the several southern California branches of the cafe, despite or perhaps because of its irritatingly named “affirmation” dishes such the “accepting” sushi bowl and the “grateful” kale salad, will not be assuaged so easily. “Fxxxing HYPOCRITES!!!! Hope they will be FLAME BURNED and eaten by Meat Eaters,” screams one post on the Facebook boycott page. “They are duping vegans to support their animal killings,” says another. The Engelharts spawned an entire industry with a carefully marketed message of peace, love and sharing, which includes a sister vegan Mexican restaurant, Gracias Madre, in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The couple have written several books, including Sacred Commerce: Business as a Path of Awakening and Kindred Spirit: Fulfilling Love’s Promise. Their personal website is named Eternal Presence and references the board game they created in 2004, called The Abounding River Board Game, which was on every table in their San Francisco flagship; and which they said would train players to embrace “an unfamiliar view of Being Abundant” and develop a “spiritual foundation” for looking at money. A Be Love Farm blogpost from February last year highlights the “big week” when they transitioned into meat products. “That transition is happening deep within our beings, we know it is a necessary and important part of our growth as well as the sustainability of our farm ... as we open our hearts further to the presence of love ... ” The page features photos of their new beef products alongside a bucolic shot of their cows “sitting down chewing their cud in the warm Spring breeze”. The couple are no strangers to controversy. Eating too much red meat ‘can age the body’, researchers claim Read more In 2011, they cited a series of “aggressive lawsuits” by disgruntled employees as the reason for having to close or sell their eight Cafe Gratitude restaurants in the Bay Area. The lawsuits challenged the restaurants’ tip-pooling practices and alleged unpaid overtime wages. At the time they wrote on their Facebook page that it would cost too much to defend themselves in court. Another lawsuit was filed by an employee, alleging he was fired after refusing to attend the controversial San Francisco-based Landmark Forum self-improvement course and an offshoot of Werner Erhard’s self-realization program. In the end, the Engelhart’s settled, selling or giving some of the restaurants to family members, including Terces’ son by a previous marriage, Matthew, who works at the LA restaurant. The couple reportedly met at a Landmark Forum seminar after Terces (which is “secret” spelled backwards) had fled a conventional life in Santa Cruz with her IBM manager husband and children, selling all their belongings and loading up an RV and hitting the road, reportedly heading for Durango, Colorado. That was in 1992. Her daughter Mollie from that marriage now runs a vegan beer garden in LA, with business partner and actor Woody Harrelson, as well as KindKreme, a vegan ice cream parlour. LA-based activist Mary Cummins, founder of Animal Advocates, claims that the Engelharts have been influenced by the controversial views of Allan Savory, the Zimbabwean ecologist and author of Holistic Management, which advocates using livestock on grasslands as the only way to reverse climate change and avoid widespread destruction of these lands. (The idea has its detractors – George Monbiot in the Guardian – and supporters – Hunter Lovins also in the Guardian.) Meantime, none of this seems likely to mollify the outraged vegans and it is unclear how this will affect the Engelhart empire, which serves 28,000 meals a day and offers an array of events and packages for families and corporations alike on their Be Love farm. Whether parents will still want their kids to pet Carmella and Cinnamon, two of their cows, after learning about the freezer full of meat is unclear. ||||| What a wonderful week it was on the farm. Our great friends who own Ca Momi in Napa gifted us with some of their truly delicious pizzas and profiteroles to make my recovery from a surgical procedure easier on me. I was so grateful for the added rest and kindness. I then got inspired to make my own profiteroles since we have this amazing farm cream and voila, see them in the picture above. Here I am piping them onto the parchment paper getting ready to bake them. Matthew continued his pruning of all the trees while the boys, Jaxon and Jack put mulch around the base of the trees. You can see that the almonds are in full bloom and the nectarine blossoms are coming on in their beautiful pinks! It was a big week as we begin to make the transition into our own meat products after nearly 40 years of vegetarianism. While I would clearly say we are in transition and that transition is happening deep within our beings, we know it is a necessary and important part of our own growth as well as the sustainability of our farm. Certainly a part of us wants to either deny the inevitability of death or simply not let ourselves get present to the reality of it, for our animals as well as ourselves. But we know that while we die a little bit each day as we open our hearts further to the presence of love, and as we are the caretakers of our farm animals the responsibility for their health and well being lies with us. This is clearly a longer discussion and we invite you to one of our upcoming farm dinners over the next 9 months, where we share more about this process. Here Matthew is straining off beef broth and our freezer full of pastured beef, our pastured beef.

With no rain in sight we have started to irrigate already, which brings me to my question for the week. How do you nourish your soul? Think about it. Have a great week, Love, Terces ||||| The husband-and-wife owners of a trendy chain of California vegan restaurants are under attack from an angry pack of animal rights activists who discovered the restaurateurs were slaughtering animals on their farm and eating meat. Matthew and Terces Engelhart, owners of the famous celebrity-patroned Cafe Gratitude and Gracias Madre restaurants, have been receving death threats from activists after they started circulating blog posts from the couple’s Be Love Farm in northern California that show the couple raising cattle, according to what they told the Hollywood Reporter. “They are duping vegans to support their animal killings,” activist Chase Avior, who organized protests at the southern California restaurants, told the Hollywood Reporter. The Engleharts started the first Cafe Gratitude in San Francisco in 2004 before opening more vegan restaurants in southern California around 2011, riding the wave of consumer demand for healthy, sustainable food. The restaurants are known for being celebrity hotspots — Emma Stone, Andrew Garfield, Kerry Washington, Jay Z, and Beyonce have all been spotted enjoying their vegan dishes. Cafe Gratitude owners Matthew and Terces Engelhart are under fire after the California based vegan restaurateurs were found to have returned to eating meat. (Ashley Dentino/via YouTube) The firestorm over the owners’ carnivorism started when vigilant vegans got a hold of a 14-month old blog post stating the couple’s decision to end their 40 years of vegetarianism and begin what they call “regenerative agriculture.” The post included photos showing freezers full of beef at their farm, jars of beef stock and of Matthew Engelhart enjoying a hamburger. “We started to observe nature and what we saw is that nature doesn’t exist without animals,” Matthew Engelhart told the Hollywood Reporter last week, as an explanation for their transition. Outraged animal rights activists weren’t so forgiving of their change in diet calling it “regenerative bulls--t!” on a Facebook page dedicated to boycotting the restaurant and organizing protests. Cafe Gratitude in Venice, Calif. is a known celebrity hotspot. (Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images) Protesters also left a slew of one-star Yelp reviews on the popular eatery’s site. “I’m GRATEFUL that I know they’re s--theads!” wrote one commenter. \\"Here's a new dish for Cafe Gratitude - I Am MURDERER!!!\\" another person wrote. Numerous protests have taken place outside their restaurants — with demonstrators carrying signs that called the restaurateurs “hypocrites” as leaders in the vegan community and others that said “no animal is grateful to die,” as a play on the restaurant's name. “People have taken up the mob mentality,” Matthew Engelhart bemoaned. Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing! ||||| The owners of the most prominent vegan restaurant chain in Los Angeles were found to be raising and \\"harvesting\\" animals at their Northern California farm. Now Hollywood's vegan community is angry, and death threats have been made. \\"People have taken up the mob mentality,\\" says Cafe Gratitude owner Matthew Engelhart. L.A.'s vegan vortex has angrily turned on the most prominent vegan restaurant group in town this week as word has spread that its owners are not just eating meat but raising and slaughtering animals at the working farm where they live in Northern California. Matthew and Terces Engelhart, the husband-and-wife proprietors of favored entertainment industry haunt Cafe Gratitude, tell The Hollywood Reporter they've been receiving death threats as part of a quickly growing, internet-bred campaign against them. It has also spawned a deluge of one-star reviews on their local outposts' respective Yelp pages, a boycott group on Facebook that tallies 571 members at press time and plans now underway for a protest at the Larchmont Village location on Friday at 7 p.m. \\"People have taken up the mob mentality,\\" says Matthew. \\"It saddens me that the choices we made in the privacy of our home would lead people to feel so betrayed that it's elevated to threats on our lives. I'm very discouraged.\\" The trouble began last week when animal rights activists discovered and then widely circulated a 14-month-old blog post written by Terces on the Engelharts' Be Love Farm website, which mixed an announcement of their transition back into a meat diet again after nearly 40 years of vegetarianism (they had been vegan since 2003) with posted pictures of strained beef broth and a freezer full of pastured beef from their own dairy cows. Matthew tells THR they have kept chickens on the farm for seven years \\"for eggs only,\\" along with the cows for five years for milk, cheese and butter that's for sale. (He claims they've \\"harvested,\\" or slaughtered, several cows in total and never sold the meat, only shared it with \\"our friends, neighbors and community.\\") The news has come as a shock to many vegans, who have been regular customers of the restaurants and claim the Engelharts have built their brand on not just serving vegan food but clearly wrapping themselves in the righteousness of the vegan cause — which they argue has now been undermined. \\"The reason we're so upset is that veganism is a belief system,\\" says Carrie Christianson, who started the Facebook boycott group. \\"You are patronizing a restaurant that you think has that philosophy, and it turns out it doesn't. Vegans should know that this restaurant has a farm that slaughters animals.\\" The Engelharts launched the first Cafe Gratitude in San Francisco in 2004. The mini-chain began colonizing Southern California in 2011 with the on-the-ground help of their manager sons from different marriages, Ryland Engelhart and Cary Mosier, beginning with a location in Larchmont Village, followed by outposts in Venice and downtown L.A.'s Arts District (as well as locations in San Diego and Newport Beach). Investors such as musician Jason Mraz have backed them. (A newer sister concept, Gracias Madre, which serves \\"meatless Mexican\\" fare, opened in 2014 in West Hollywood; their daughter, Mollie, co-owns Culver City's separate Sage Organic Vegan Bistro — which also purchases from Be Love Farm — with Woody Harrelson.) Cafe Gratitude is known for giving dishes names that are self-affirmations. The most popular include the \\"I Am Whole\\" macrobiotic sea-vegetable rice and a curried lentil assemblage called \\"I Am Humble.\\" The locations have become a solid entertainment industry draw for business lunches, as well as a reliable celebrity nexus. Customers range from Beyonce Knowles and Sacha Baron Cohen to Ariana Grande and Jake Gyllenhaal. The Engelharts frame their return to \\"sustainable, regenerative\\" animal consumption as the mindful culmination of years spent laboring on their upstate farm. \\"We started to observe nature, and what we saw is that nature doesn't exist without animals,\\" says Matthew. \\"Neither does natural farming. You know, you can't buy organic vegetables that aren't fertilized with animal residue. So that was our discovery. We aren't on a soapbox.\\" Yet while the Engelharts are at pains to paint their decision as a private and personal rural journey separate from their public work at their urban restaurants, their critics find the reasoning specious, believing the enterprises, the figureheads and their choices are inextricably bound. \\"This is a vegan restaurant company that's been a leader in the vegan community,\\" says Chase Avior, a screenwriter and director who is organizing the Friday protest. \\"If they're going to go around and say it's not about animal rights, it's not about speaking about the animals horrifically abused, it's just about better nurturing a plant-based lifestyle, that's something different. A lot of vegans have a right to feel betrayed by this.\\" Still, the couple's vegan supporters think the fury is misplaced. \\"Boycott factory farming — something that will make a real difference to the cause,\\" says Rainbeau Mars, author of The 21-Day SuperStar Cleanse and, along with Ryland Engelhart, a board member at Venice-based healthy-soil nonprofit Kiss the Ground. \\"And as for their own personal diets, would we stop supporting the Dalai Lama because he eats meat? Or stop supporting the organic farmer who grows your tomatoes because she eats meat?\\" After that interview, Mars wrote a long follow-up email to THR to clarify her position (\\"despite needing to go teach a yoga class on the helicopter pad of the Four Seasons this morning and head out of town this evening\\"). In it, Mars explains how she has worked in \\"service to greater humanity\\" and preaches a sort of compassion. \\"I feel we should support the leaders in our community that are sharing charity and compassion, health and community activism such as the founders of Cafe Gratitude and Gracias Madre,\\" she says. \\"I invite us all to not point the finger at others but look at ourselves.\\" Such thinking doesn't sit well with others who have spoken out about the Engelharts' choices at Be Love Farm, which according to the couple these days supplies only a limited amount of fruits and vegetables to the restaurants. One of them is the musician Moby, who opened his own vegan restaurant five months ago in Silver Lake called Little Pine. \\"I sincerely hope that they discontinue their practice of raising and killing animals for food,\\" he wrote on Facebook. Meanwhile, Cooking Channel personality and raw food chef Jason Wrobel (his clients include Robin Wright and Jeremy Piven) penned a long open letter on his website, echoing many online sentiments: \\"People feel misled, deliberately lied to and that a business they've so lovingly supported for many years has lost its way. I feel that my hard-earned money has been used for purposes that are unethical, cruel and out-of-alignment with my values. And I strongly feel that a more public announcement from the company should have been made about the practices at the farm, not tucked away in some obscure blog post.\\" For their part, the Engelharts profess to be perplexed by the dissent. \\"I don't think there's any organization on the planet that's done more to promote a plant-based diet than us,\\" says Matthew. \\"We've moved it from a dogma to a genre. We serve 28,000 meals a week in all of our enterprises. We've done nothing but a plant-based diet at our restaurants and we're being attacked. It doesn't make sense to me.\\" Their critics aren't satisfied, despite their record. \\"I eat at non-vegan restaurants all the time,\\" says Elana Lavine, who runs the L.A. healthy lifestyle blog Klean Slate. \\"Just don't claim to be something you're not. They're slaughtering animals! And there's been a lack of total transparency about it on the restaurant side. It looks kind of shady, like they are hiding things. And there was always that cloud around them when it came to the cult thing.\\" The \\"cult thing\\" has left customers leery in the past. The couple, who like to say they practice \\"sacred commerce,\\" had to close their Northern California locations in 2010 in the midst of lawsuit battles, one related to a policy encouraging allegedly illegal tip-pooling and another stemming from a mandate that their employee get involved with the controversial personal-betterment organization Landmark Forum, a successor to Werner Erhard's 1970s self-help program EST, which centered on a unique style of session therapy that was recently dramatized on FX's period spy show The Americans. Both iterations have been criticized for their aggressive recruitment tactics. The Engelharts, who met while attending Landmark Forum, believe they're being held up to a dogmatic purity standard — one that, in the scheme of their contributions to veganism, is entirely unfair. \\"Somehow we got made mom and dad of some vegan movement,\\" says Matthew. \\"We never signed up for that. It's crazy. Do [the protestors] check in on the diets of every other vegan restaurant owner? Do they check in on the diets of the owners of Whole Foods? We are baffled. And believe me there are lots of vegan enterprises where the principals are not vegan, or they have other enterprises that are not vegan.\\" He goes on, \\"I am allowed to change my mind. And by the way, I never even told them what my mind was. All I told them was it's a vegan restaurant. And it still is! And it always will be!\\" ||||| Chandra Gilbert EXECUTIVE CHEF With the arrival of Gracias Madre in Los Angeles, Chef Chandra Gilbert finds themself once again featuring bold flavors and seasonally-conscious ingredients.

It was during that time that the idea for Gracias Madre began entering into the conversation with Café Gratitude Founders Matthew and Terces Engelhart. Together, they co-designed the restaurant's aesthetic and co-created the menu featuring produce from the Engelhart's Be Love Farm in Vacaville, bringing Gilbert's dream to fruition with Gracias Madre's San Francisco opening in 2009. The restaurant, located in San Francisco's Mission District, quickly garnered critical acclaim for its vibrant interpretation of Mexican cuisine. With the opening of Gracias Madre in West Hollywood in January 2014, Gilbert brings that passion to Los Angeles with a menu that blends produce from Be Love Farm with ingredients sourced from local farmers markets. ||||| Crawl of outlinks from wikipedia.org started March, 2016.

It started off with a trip to Los Angeles for the training of 112 new employees for the upcoming opening of the new Cafe Gratitude in the Arts District of downtown LA. Whenever we think, “really more employees, more food, more….. we stop and put our attention on the employees of the past who have become such amazing, inspiring, leaders in the world, and that always has us sign up for the next Cafe. Thank you to all those who keep our attention on what matters most, the opening of hearts, the expansion of love, the right livelihood of our work place… you make all the difference. On our lunch break at the new employee training, look what showed up to entertain us all! Fortunately my trips to LA include a snuggle with my two newest grandsons, Valentine (6 months) and Rio (2 months). pretty precious. Being a grandmother is the BEST EVER! This week on the farm we harvested some GIANT lettuce… see the first picture of my sweet husband holding one of the giant heads! We also cooked our first hamburgers, see Matthew eating his first in over 40 years! I promise this transition has been challenging and insightful and we are ever so thankful for the sacrifice that our cows made. Here is Matthew’s response to someone’s questioning our adding meat to our diet, a great question. Perhaps I’ve e failed to explain adequately why I would pursue the path of eating flesh after 40 years of vegetarianism. The answer is non-violence but non-violence to the whole system, all species. Agriculture is most violent destructive force on the planet. It has caused the extinction of more species then any other activity. Earth balance margarine is made from Canadian canola. Organic or not this product required a plow to destroy Canadian prairie an act of violence against burrowing owls, ferrets, prairie dogs, dozens of insect and bird species. If that prairie had been maintained in grassland with well managed cows or buffalo those species would not be killed or displaced. 30% of the world’s surface is grasslands, Grasslands need herds of ruminants to thrive, when they are removed, the grasslands degenerate into desert. Desertification is violence against all species including humans. The conflict in Syria and Iraq can be easily tied to desertification, mismanaged soil. Herding ruminants are our best tool to restore fertility to the earth, keep the earth covered, and reverse desertification and climate change. If I knew of a better or even another solution, I would choose it. We need cows to keep the earth alive, cows make an extreme sacrifice for humanity but that is their position in God’s plan as food for the predators. Cows maintain the grass, predators maintain the herd by culling the weak and sick. We can be part of that sacrament. Sacrifice is part of life. As in the passion of Christ, we all have to spill our blood for humanity to know the Father. The cow’s sacrifice was been ordained, ours we must choose. Wendell Berry quote: “To live we must daily break the body and shed the blood of Creation. When we do it knowingly, lovingly, skillfully, reverently, it is a sacrament. When we do it ignorantly, greedily, clumsily, destructively it is a desecration.” We attended a Allan Savory workshop on a neighboring farm this week and I had the privileged of sitting next to him at dinner. We had an inspiring conversation about “biltong” a South African style of dried beef and he taught me how to make it the real way. Here it is drying. Legend has it that Biltong is the food that gets credit for the strength of the men in South Africa, it is a peppery salted cured meat, made from the muscle cuts. Again I remind you all that we feel like vegan ism is a great response the the abuse of animals in the industrial food system, AND that animals raised in a healthy and humane way are a great source of nutrition for humans. It is so important that we bridge the gap of “knowing our food” and don’t sell out for distancing ourselves from the full cycle of life and death. This week I am reminded of the power of God’s grace and the importance of letting it in. Breathe. Love. Terces P.S. Flashback… look at these photos of cold brewed coffee and almond milk, now sold in grocery stores… 11 years ago this month when we opened our first Cafe Gratitude in the Mission District of San Francisco, people would ask us daily, “How do you get milk out of an almond?” and “What is cold brewed coffee?” We’ve come a long way baby! |||||","completion":"The founders of celebrity-endorsed vegan restaurant chain, Cafe Gratitude, claim to have received death threats from animal rights activists after admitting that they raise, slaughter and eat animals on their farm in Vacaville, California.

We have the equation: 6 * s = 30 * s + 25 * s - 147 First, we need to add the terms with s on the right side of the equation. 30 * s + 25 * s = (30 + 25) * s = 55 * s Now, our equation looks like this: 6 * s = 55 * s - 147 Next, we want to get all the s terms on one side of the equation. So, we will subtract 6 * s from both sides: 55 * s - 6 * s = 147 This simplifies to: 49 * s = 147 Now, we need to solve for s. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 49: s = 147 / 49 Finally, we find out that: s = 3 So, the solution to the math problem is s = 3."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the names of the two houses of the Indian Parliament?, using the article: Karnataka has a parliamentary system of government with two democratically elected houses, the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council.

Since 2013, the group members are Anthony Field, Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce, and Emma Watkins. The original members were Field, Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page, and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Page, Cook, and Fatt retired, and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce, and Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects. Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band The Cockroaches in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children's music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album, and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time. The group augmented their act with animal characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog, as well as the character Captain Feathersword, played by Paul Paddick since 1993. They travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The group's DVDs, CDs, and television programs have been produced independently since their inception. Their high point came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market. The group was formally consolidated in 2005. They were listed at the top of Business Review Weekly's top-earning Australian entertainers four years in a row, and earned A45 million in 2009.

Context: There is disagreement about the origin of the term, but general consensus that \\"cardinalis\\" from the word cardo (meaning 'pivot' or 'hinge') was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean “principal,” “eminent,” or \\"superior.\\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \\"title\\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals.

This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

Write an article that answers the following question: Where there more Native Americans or African Americans in the city?","completion":"Title: African Americans and Native Americans in the City: A Comparative Analysis Introduction Cities across the United States showcase a diverse range of residents that reflect the nation's rich cultural, ethnic, and historical heritage. Among these populations are Native Americans and African Americans, who have played significant roles in shaping the country's history and identity. In this article, we will explore the demographic composition of these two groups in urban areas, examining whether there are more Native Americans or African Americans in cities across the United States. Step 1: Data Collection To answer the question of whether there are more Native Americans or African Americans in the city, it is essential to gather reliable and up-to-date demographic data. The primary source for such information is the United States Census Bureau, which conducts a decennial census and provides ongoing data updates on various demographic indicators. Additionally, city-specific demographic studies, published by official government agencies or reputable research institutions, can serve as valuable supplementary sources to provide localized insights. Step 2: Data Analysis Once the necessary demographic data has been collected, the next step would be to analyze the information and draw meaningful comparisons between the populations of Native Americans and African Americans in urban areas across the United States. This could involve looking at absolute numbers, as well as calculating the percentage of each group within the overall urban population. Step 3: Interpretation and Contextualization After analyzing the data, the relative sizes of the African American and Native American urban populations can be determined. However, to better understand the significance of these findings, it is crucial to place them within the broader historical and social context. This may involve exploring the factors that have contributed to the present demographic composition, such as historical migration trends, urbanization patterns, and the impact of various socioeconomic and political events. Step 4: Addressing the Question With the data analysis and contextual understanding complete, we can now address the original question: Are there more Native Americans or African Americans in cities across the United States? Based on the most recent available data from the United States Census Bureau, African Americans outnumber Native Americans in the majority of cities across the country. As of 2019, African Americans accounted for approximately 12.3% of the U.S. population, while Native Americans constituted around 1.3%. Furthermore, African Americans are more likely to be concentrated in urban areas, compared to Native Americans, who often have higher proportions of their population residing in rural regions or on reservations. The historical reasons for these differences are multifaceted. African Americans have been disproportionately impacted by the legacies of slavery and segregation, which have contributed to their urbanization and concentration in cities throughout the United States. Meanwhile, the forced relocation of Native Americans through various policies, including the Indian Removal Act of 1830, has led to the establishment of reservations and confinement of their populations away from cities. Conclusion While both African Americans and Native Americans have contributed to the rich tapestry of urban life, it is clear that African Americans significantly outnumber Native Americans in cities across the United States. Nevertheless, understanding the history and complexities behind this demographic distribution can help to create more inclusive and equitable policies for both groups. By fostering an environment that celebrates diversity and encourages the empowerment of different multicultural voices, our cities can continue to evolve as vibrant and dynamic spaces for all who inhabit them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some days, don't you think, \\"Wouldn't it be nice if the laundry would just do itself?\\" Self-cleaning clothes may sound crazy. But Australian researchers have found a way to make something like this possible! A team at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, found a way to put special nanostructures into clothing, which can then clean the clothes. When sunlight hits the nanostructures, they break down the dirt and stains that don't belong on your clothes. The nanostructures don't break down the actual clothing because cotton and the other clothing materials are too strong to be broken down. According to CNN, the researchers cover the clothing in a solution made of silver and copper nanostructures. All it takes is 40 minutes of sunlight and your clothes will look as good as new. So if you spill on yourself during lunch, you can step outside for a walk, and it will be clean by the time you go inside. It not only makes your life easier, but it can also be good for the environment. According to the US Department of Energy, the average load of laundry uses about 25 gallons (about 94 liters) of water. Water is a very important resource, so using less of it to wash clothes is better for the environment. But one of the scientists at RMIT University knows more needs to be done. \\"There's more work to do before we can start throwing out our washing machines,\\" said Dr Rajesh Ramanathan, \\"but this is a strong foundation .\\" So what's the next step? Ramanathan wants to either start selling the solution by itself or convincing clothing makers to treat the clothing with the solution while clothes are being made. What can we learn from the passage? A) Silver and copper sell well. B) The solution is not put into practice. C) Clothing makes certainly like the solution.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, answer the following question. When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? Answer:","completion":"The author does not specify an exact time when you should start adding superfoods to your clean eating diet. Instead, they emphasize that while superfoods are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet, you don't have to incorporate them immediately when starting clean eating. The focus should be on buying and consuming clean foods that you can afford. Once your budget allows or you find affordable sources of superfoods, you can then consider adding them to your diet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...

McCallum, 45, said he was feeling mixed emotions because his fellow convict, Willie Stuckey, had passed away behind bars in 2001 before he could see their names cleared. It's 'a bittersweet moment, because I'm walking out alone,' he told reporters outside the court. Overwhelmed: David McCallum is comforted by Rosia Nealy, the mother of fellow convict Willie Stuckey, after their convictions were thrown out in Brooklyn on Wednesday. McCallum has been in prison for 29 years Back up:","completion":"David McCallum, a New Yorker who spent 29 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of murder, was finally set free after his conviction was overturned by Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Matthew D'Emic on Wednesday. McCallum, 45, has spent nearly two-thirds of his life behind bars for a crime he did not commit, and understandably, he was emotional when the decision was announced. Upon hearing the news, McCallum sobbed into his hands, overwhelmed by the realization that he would finally be allowed to walk free after so many years spent in prison. He admitted to feeling mixed emotions about the situation, as his fellow convict and friend, Willie Stuckey, was not alive to see their names cleared and share the moment. Stuckey had passed away behind bars in 2001, and McCallum described the experience as \\"a bittersweet moment, because I'm walking out alone.\\" After his release, McCallum was comforted by Rosia Nealy, the mother of Willie Stuckey. The two shared a moment of shared grief and relief, knowing that justice had finally been served, albeit too late for Stuckey. McCallum's wrongful conviction serves as a stark reminder of the flaws in the criminal justice system, and how it can sometimes fail those who are innocent. Throughout his time in prison, McCallum maintained his innocence and tried to appeal the decision, but faced numerous obstacles and setbacks. It was not until his case was picked up by a team of dedicated attorneys, including high-profile lawyer and exoneration advocate, that he finally found hope for his release. Several factors contributed to McCallum's wrongful conviction, including coerced confessions, potential misconduct by the officers and detectives involved in the case, and a lack of solid corroborating evidence. His and Stuckey's convictions greatly relied on their confessions, which they claimed were extracted under duress. The legal team working to exonerate McCallum was able to present new evidence that cast significant doubt on the legitimacy of the case against him, eventually leading to his conviction being vacated. David McCallum's story is both a heart-wrenching illustration of the human cost of wrongful convictions and a powerful reminder of the importance of pursuing justice even when the odds may seem insurmountable. His release after 29 years in prison is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the tireless dedication of those who work to ensure that innocent individuals are not left to languish behind bars. As McCallum begins the process of rebuilding his life, support is expected to come from various quarters, including the legal team who fought for his release, as well as his friends and family who never gave up hope. His journey of healing and reintegration into society serves as a beacon of hope for others who may find themselves in a similar situation, encouraging them to keep fighting for their right to freedom and justice. In conclusion, David McCallum's release is a bittersweet moment for him and for the family of his fellow convict, Willie Stuckey. It demonstrates the shortcomings in the criminal justice system but also shows the power of perseverance, the importance of seeking truth and justice, and the significance of offering support to individuals who have been wrongfully imprisoned. McCallum's long-awaited exoneration serves as a cautionary tale for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the public and is a rallying cry for the need to improve the criminal justice system to minimize such miscarriages of justice in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vehicles being developed that can automatically steer, brake, accelerate, and change lanes. Google, Daimler and Nissan are a few of the firms testing this technology. Driverless trucks could aid businesses by running around the clock. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: The Future of Automotive Technology: The Rise of Driverless Vehicles Introduction: Technology has rapidly evolved in recent years, with tremendous advancements in various fields of life. One of the areas where we see remarkable advances is the automotive industry. Companies like Google, Daimler, and Nissan are pushing the boundaries of technology by testing driverless vehicles that can autonomously steer, brake, accelerate, and even change lanes. This article will explore the development of these groundbreaking vehicles and discuss how they could revolutionize businesses by providing round-the-clock services. Step 1: Unveiling the Technology To write about the technology involved in the development of driverless vehicles, we must first touch on the advancements made by Google, Daimler, and Nissan. These companies have been testing their autonomous vehicle systems, which rely on a combination of sensors, cameras, and advanced software to interpret the real-time traffic and road conditions. The sophisticated algorithms allow the vehicle to make split-second decisions, navigating the roads safely without any human intervention. Step 2: Highlighting the Benefits of Autonomous Vehicles Autonomous and driverless vehicles come with numerous advantages such as increased safety, fuel efficiency, and reduced emissions resulting from the precise control of acceleration and braking. In addition, driverless trucks have the potential to reshape the transportation industry by enabling businesses to operate around the clock. This could lead to improved efficiency and higher revenue for companies. Step 3: Discussing the Implications for the Transportation Industry Driverless trucks, in particular, could have profound implications for the transportation industry. Traditional truck drivers are limited by federal regulations that restrict working hours to prevent fatigue-related accidents. With driverless trucks, these restrictions become irrelevant as the vehicles can operate non-stop. Moreover, this technology can significantly reduce the risks of accidents associated with human error, leading to safer roads and more efficient transportation networks. Step 4: Addressing the Challenges Of course, there are challenges to be faced in the widespread adoption of driverless vehicles. For example, legislation and government regulations need to be updated to accommodate the use of autonomous vehicles on public roads. Additionally, cybersecurity must be a top priority to prevent hackers from compromising the safety of these vehicles. Companies need to address these concerns in the development process, working closely with regulatory authorities to ensure a smooth transition and the integration of driverless vehicles into our daily lives. Conclusion: Embracing the Future of Transportation In conclusion, the development of driverless vehicles has the potential to revolutionize the automotive industry, and by extension, the entire transportation sector. With companies like Google, Daimler, and Nissan continually pushing the limits of technology, we are inching closer to a future where autonomous vehicles are commonplace. As a society, we need to embrace the changes that come with this transformative technology, as it will ultimately bring about safer roads, improved efficiency, and a more sustainable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Also, it wouldn't be the \\"end of the world's company\\" or \\"United's company\\" because those are phrases or words used in the passage but are not people who can own companies. Other individuals mentioned like the Governor or Obama or Romney could theoretically have companies but there's no hint in the passage that they'd be relevant to the story.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -49*r - 91*r + 140 = 0 for r.","completion":"To solve the given equation -49*r - 91*r + 140 = 0 for r, we will first combine the like terms and then isolate the variable r. Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem: Given Equation: -49*r - 91*r + 140 = 0 Step 1: Combine the like terms (terms with the same variable r). -49*r and -91*r are the like terms, and by adding them, we get: -49*r + (-91*r) = -140*r Now, our equation becomes: -140*r + 140 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable (r) by adding 140*r to both sides of the equation. -140*r + 140*r + 140 = 0 + 140*r 140 = 140*r Step 3: Divide by the coefficient of the variable (in this case, 140) to determine the value of r. 140 = 140*r 140/140 = r Step 4: Simplify the equation. 1 = r So, the solution for the given equation -49*r - 91*r + 140 = 0 is r = 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jerusalem (CNN) -- As the United Nations was preparing Friday to debate a resolution branding Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank as illegal, Palestinian officials called Obama administration efforts to head off the vote as evidence that American policy is \\"biased\\" and \\"seriously wrong.\\" \\"This is a moment of truth because very clearly the Americans so far have placed their strategic alliance with Israel and the legal cover for Israeli violations above their own interests,\\" said veteran Palestinian legislator and PLO executive committee member Hanan Ashrawi. \\"The Americans have very clearly demonstrated to Palestinians, to Arab public opinion, and to world public opinion that they are biased to the point of destruction,\\" Ashrawi told CNN, echoing an argument made by many Palestinian officials. Among the options that have been floated,","completion":"though not confirmed, are the possibility of the United States abstaining from the vote or using its veto power to block the resolution. This has heightened the tension between Israel and its long-time ally, as well as among Palestinians who view it as another instance of the U.S. siding with Israel over their own interests. The proposed resolution, if passed, would have significant implications for the peace process between Israel and Palestine, as well as for the wider geopolitical situation in the region. It would not only declare the Israeli settlements in the West Bank as illegal, but would also demand that Israel cease all settlement activities immediately. Previous resolutions regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been passed in the United Nations, but the current one carries more weight due to the heightened tensions and ongoing challenges in negotiating a peace deal. The Israeli settlements in the West Bank have been a major point of contention between Israel and Palestine for decades, as Palestinians view them as an impediment to the creation of their own, continuous and independent state. For Israel, the settlements are seen as a part of their national security strategy and an extension of their sovereignty. The United Nations, as well as the international community at large, have long held that the settlements are illegal under international law, as they involve the construction of Israeli civilian infrastructure on Palestinian land. The Obama administration's efforts to block or at least delay the vote have garnered mixed reactions. Some see these efforts as a move to maintain the strong, longstanding alliance between the United States and Israel, while others argue that it confirms the notion that the U.S. government is biased toward Israel and disregards Palestinian interests. Critics of the Obama administration's stance argue that it could hinder, rather than promote, the potential resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as the perceived bias could exacerbate tensions between the two parties and reduce the likelihood of meaningful negotiations. Moreover, the U.S. government's involvement in the potential vote has implications for the domestic political scene. The subsequent administration, under President Donald Trump, may face the repercussions of the Obama administration's stance on the issue, particularly if it continues to be perceived as biased in favor of Israel. This could complicate attempts to broker peace in the region and further strain the relationship between the U.S. and the international community. In conclusion, the debate over the United Nations resolution on Israeli settlements is a complex and multifaceted issue, with implications not only for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process but also for the wider geopolitical situation in the region. The Obama administration's efforts to impede or postpone the vote have further complicated matters, raising questions about U.S. policy and their commitment to Palestinian interests. As the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen what the long-term effects of the U.S. stance on this issue will be and how it will impact the prospects for peace between Israel and Palestine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf. Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season. In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.

Given the question: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

For years a nearby villager named Germain has been Ponso's only company,visiting him so often to bring bananas and bread--the chimp's only source of food on the tiny island.It was clear how much Ponso missed companionship when he was recently visited by Chimpanzee Conservation Centre Director Estelle Raballand.The chimp immediately embraced Estelle Raballand in a huge hug and laughed as she reached out for him,with his smile from ear to ear.

The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides also promised to hold follow-up negotiations. “We’re going to denuke North Korea,” Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren. He also said neither side issued ultimatums and that the agreement Tuesday was the result of months of negotiations. “You know that could have ended in a war, that could have ended with many millions of people — you know North Korea very well, Seoul has 28 million people, that could have ended with millions of people dead but we ended with a deal,” he said. Trump also told VOA that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announced one concession long-sought by North Korea. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said. Trump said at later news conference that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" As for verification, Trump said he and Kim discussed the issue and that monitoring denuclearization efforts would be achieved “by having a lot of people there.” He also predicted Kim would begin work right away to “live up to” the agreement.

Concepts: chip, lunch, order, sandwich Write a sentence that includes all these words.","completion":"Sure. Let's look at all the words provided; chip, lunch, order, and sandwich. To create a meaningful narrative, let's start by setting a scenario where these specific words can be made use of in a cohesive manner. Here we go: Every day at lunch, John has a routine that he never deviates from, more akin to a cherished ritual that gives his day a sense of predictability and ease. As the clock strikes twelve, he rises from his desk, the sharp clicking sound of his keyboard subsiding like a symphony fading out, replaced by the soft sigh of relief his chair generates as he lifts off. Comfortably dressed in his usual work attire, he walks to the company cafeteria, a sea of chatter and culinary aromas greeting him affectionately. He scans the room, noting the friendly faces of his co-workers socializing, their talk a mix of business and leisure, and the diligent cafeteria staff managing an array of duties - from keeping the serving area clean to ensuring everyone gets their lunch in a timely manner. After standing in the queue for a moment, it's John's turn to place his order. He smiles at the cafeteria staff, the lady whose name tag reads 'Anna' and with a friendly nod exchanges pleasantries. They have this chat almost every day, a small bond forged over many lunches and reoccurring taste preferences. Anna is jovial and warm, her dedication to her work clear in the way she interacts with everyone, making people feel seen and valued even in their short beverage or food exchanges. When Anna asks John what he'll have today, there's no pause or indecisiveness. He doesn't need to scan the chalkboard menu hanging above her head, where all the daily offers are beautifully scribbled; he knows what he wants. And so, without missing a beat, he places his order: \\"The usual please — a turkey and Swiss sandwich with a hint of honey mustard, and a side of those delightful Kettle chips you recommended last week.\\" Anna nods, already reaching for the fresh ingredients. Weaving between the loaves of bread and strips of meat with practiced ease, she sets about crafting the sandwich, tailoring the taste according to his preferences. As she adds the finishing touch, she drops a handful of the golden, crispy Kettle chips on the side of his plate, creating a delightful combination of flavours — the salty, crunchiness of the chips complementing the softness of the sandwich perfectly. Thus, our four words — chip, lunch, order, and sandwich, have been strung together into a detailed narrative, creating an evocative and visually attractive scene of a regular lunch at an office cafeteria."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Young, whose work is often frank and rich with twisted humor, tells NPR's Renee Montaigne that as he recovers from operation, he's also slowly returning to his everyday writing habits. \\"I'm getting back to it,\\" Young says.\\"Not with the sort of concentration and sort of flame that I look forward to in the future, but I am blackening some pages.\\" And on those blackened pages you'll find poems like \\" How Grasp Green,\\" which carries themes of springtime and rebirth.It's one of the first poems Young has written since his transplant. It's easy to spot clues to Young's awful health situation in the lines of his poetry. Fall Higher's \\"Vintage\\" opens with, \\"Because I will die soon, I fall asleep, during the lecture on the ongoing emergency.\\" And the poem \\"-The Rhythms Pronounce Themselves Then Vanish--published in The /Vew Barker in February --opens with the CT scan that revealed Young's heart condition. Young says \\"Rhythms\\" was written about the beginning of his illness. \\"I had been having a lot of physical pain so that I could hardly walk a block.I got sent to a gastroenterologist and he did a series of tests, and then the tests came back to me and it was all heart related,\\" he says.\\" And the outlook wasn't good. Hearts tend to come up a lot in poetry, and that's especially true of Young's work, which has clearly been influenced by the troubles of his own heart, \\"A lot of times, it's not just a metaphor ,\\" Young says.\\"For me, it's an actual concern because I've been living with this disease for over 10 years.My father died of heart problems when he was 49, so it's been a sort of shadowy concern for me my whole life. But Young's poems also deal with more abstract matters of the heart.He wrote Fall... Question: The poetry collection Fall Higher _ . Answer: Answer:","completion":"The poetry collection Fall Higher, written by Dean Young, showcases a strong theme of impermanence throughout its verses while delving into the poet's personal struggles with a weakening heart condition. It was published in April, shortly after Young received a life-saving heart transplant. The collection features a raw and twisted humor, as well as poems that carry themes of rebirth and renewal, such as \\"How Grasp Green.\\" Young's work has often been influenced by his own heart issues, making the use of hearts in his poetry more than just a metaphor. Alongside his physical struggles, his poems also explore more abstract matters of the heart, addressing emotional and philosophical aspects associated with human experiences and vulnerability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Saw this my last day at the festival, and was glad I stuck around that extra couple of days. Poetic, moving, and most surprisingly, funny, in it's own strange way.

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS. Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \\"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected? Options: A. Because she thought the other actress did a bad job B. Because she was treated like a liar C. not enough information D. Because the role had to be changed for the new actress Answer:","completion":"B.

The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. The four incorrect answers are other holding statements. You should find the correct option. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. the trial court did not depart from the essential requirements of the law in requiring production of the document covered by item (2) because the document is not privileged. The only document covered by item (2) is the employment agreement between Jenney and Airdata. Jenney cannot seriously contend that the employment agreement is protected by the attorney-client privilege be- ■ cause both he and Airdata had copies of the agreement before Jenney retained his former attorney to negotiate the retirement agreement. The fact that Jenney may have given a copy of the employment agreement to the attorney negotiating the retirement agreement does not convert the nonprivileged employment agreement into a privileged document.

Part #3: Interpret the context of the citing text. Usage: Understand the specific issue in the prompt, such as determining if the employment agreement is privileged. Sample response: The issue at hand is whether the employment agreement between Jenney and Airdata is protected by the attorney-client privilege. According to the citing text, it is not privileged because both parties had copies of the agreement before Jenney retained his former attorney to negotiate the retirement agreement.

IMF signs off 17.5bn loan for Ukraine in second attempt to stave off bankruptcy The International Monetary Fund has signed off on a 17.5bn (£11.8bn) four-year aid programme for Ukraine, the second attempt in less than a year to help the country avoid bankruptcy. The programme includes an immediate payment of 5bn for general budget support to help stabilise Ukraine’s listing economy. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, said the aim was to provide immediate economic stabilisation for a country beset by conflict. The programme was ambitious and involved risks, Lagarde said, “notably those stemming from the conflict” with pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. “With continued firm implementation, there is reasonably strong prospect of success.” Related: Russian military shelled Ukraine from mid-July, report says The IMF loan is expected to unlock further credits from other donors. Ukraine will also pursue debt-restructuring talks with existing bondholders. The combined package of assistance is estimated at 40bn, the IMF has said. In a televised statement, Arseny Yatseniuk, UKraine’s prime minister, said the IMF move would let the country tap 7.5bn in other loans. Another 15.4bn is expected in debt relief, according to sources familiar with the IMF programme. “[The money] will be used to stabilise the currency. It will enable the Ukrainian economy to grow from 2016,” Yatseniuk said. The IMF approved a 17bn two-year loan to Ukraine last year, but deemed it insufficient to support economic reforms while the government continued to battle pro-Russia separatists. Pro-Russia rebels and the government agreed to a peace deal in Minsk last month, but both sides continue to accuse each other of violations. The unrest in the east follows months of upheaval from anti-government protests and Russia’s subsequent annexation of the Crimea region. Lagarde said last week that an injection of financial support for Ukraine and its success largely hinged on the stability in the eastern of the country and how the security crisis was resolved. After a year of political upheaval and war, Ukraine’s economy is in a tailspin with a currency that just pulled back from record lows, the highest interest rates in 15 years, and central bank reserves of only 6.4bn, barely enough to cover five weeks of imports. Ukraine’s parliament last week approved a raft of IMF-backed amendments to its 2015 draft budget that were key preconditions for IMF approval of the bailout. The fund complimented those steps, including the willingness of Ukraine officials to let the currency float. “They have maintained fiscal discipline in very difficult conditions,” Lagarde said.

What is the answer to this question? who did the original voice for mickey mouse?","completion":"The original voice of Mickey Mouse was provided by none other than the creator of the character, Walt Disney (born on December 5, 1901, in Hermosa, Chicago, Illinois, United States). Walter Elias Disney, an American entrepreneur, animator, and film producer, co-founded the reputable Walt Disney Productions (now The Walt Disney Company) with his brother, Roy O. Disney, in 1923. He rapidly gained prominence and recognition for his innovations in animation, becoming one of the most iconic animators globally. Mickey Mouse made its debut in the animated short film, \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" on November 18, 1928. This film followed earlier silent cartoon figures Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and Julius the Cat but received much more positive reception and popularity compared to its predecessors. In \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" Walt Disney himself provided the high-pitched, carefree voice of Mickey Mouse. Mickey's character was developed by Disney and his colleague Ub Iwerks, an American animator and cartoonist. Walt Disney continued providing Mickey's voice in numerous other films and short cartoons from 1928 to 1947. Some of the notable early works featuring Mickey Mouse include \\"The Barn Dance\\" (1929), \\"The Opry House\\" (1929), and \\"The Band Concert\\" (1935). Mickey Mouse has, over the years, evolved and become one of the most recognized and beloved characters in popular culture. The character is considered the mascot of The Walt Disney Company. In 1946, during production of the film \\"Mickey And The Beanstalk,\\" Disney realized that his extensive workload and smoking habit had taken a toll on his voice; he found it more challenging to perform Mickey's voice consistently. As a result, he passed on the responsibility of voicing Mickey Mouse to James MacDonald, a British-American musician and voice actor who was a member of Disney's animation team. MacDonald continued to voice Mickey Mouse until his retirement in 1977, after which Wayne Allwine took over the role. Today, Bret Iwan holds the honor of being the voice behind Mickey Mouse. Through Walt Disney's groundbreaking work and original voice performance, Mickey Mouse has become an iconic and enduring character that continues to captivate the hearts of millions and represents the magical world of Disney."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Columbus, Ohio — The realities of the electoral map meant that the Romney campaign really had no choice but to bet big on Ohio, and that bet was a loser. In addition to some critical on-the-ground specifics — Ohio is not hurting as badly as the rest of the country — there were three main reasons for that. 1. Ohio likes crony capitalism. The automotive bailout is popular in Ohio, and not just among self-interested workers and investors in that industry. Putting General Motors on federal life support is economically daft and morally dubious, but it gave the Obama administration a powerful tool for convincing middle-class workers that the president is on their side. He might be doing something silly and destructive, but to be seen as doing something is politically useful. That it was General Motors and Chrysler was critical: Americans have a particularly romantic attitude toward automobile manufacturers, probably because Americans have a particularly romantic attitude toward automobiles. The (mostly mythical) image of the blue-collar homeowner supporting a four-person family in comfort by spending 40 hours a week on the assembly line is up there with mom and apple pie in the pantheon of American sentimentality. If President Obama had associated himself with the bailout of, say, Eastman Kodak — which will cease providing health care and other benefits to 56,000 retirees as part of its bankruptcy — it would not have imbued him with quite the same glow. And that is a specific instance of the more general and lamentable fact that . . . 2. Class warfare works. It is juvenile and it is economically illiterate, but a fair number of Americans worked themselves up into a lather over Mitt Romney’s paying a relatively low tax rate. Taxing capital gains at a lower rate than wages has been for a long time a mostly uncontroversial economic policy with fairly wide support across the partisan and ideological spectrum. When Bill Clinton signed into a law a reduction in the capital-gains tax rate, there was no mutiny on the left. More broadly, most voters do not have anything like the economic sophistication even to understand what Romney did at Bain Capital, much less how such private-equity firms provide real economic benefits. These are the citizens Bastiat had in mind when he wrote about what is seen and what is unseen: They can see outsourcing and declining manufacturing employment, but they cannot see (at least not very clearly) the benefits associated with integrated global supply chains or increases in manufacturing productivity. It may not be possible to be too thin, but it is, apparently, possible to be too rich, at least for an electorate that can be swayed by envy. 3. Repealing Obamacare was not a deal cincher in Ohio. A number of people I spoke to in the state suggested that the Romney-Ryan ticket paid too much attention to repealing Obamacare without spelling out an alternative that was sufficiently simple and attractive to voters who are not committed conservatives. One veteran of the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations argued that while Ohio voters may not be crazy about the Affordable Care Act, neither are they burning partisans of the campaign to repeal it. As with the GM bailout, many voters regard Obamacare as an example of the administration’s trying to do something for them, even if they are not entirely sold on the particulars. There is not much in this to comfort conservatives. The lessons of Ohio are that Barack Obama is a skillful demagogue, that the ancients were wise to number envy among the deadly sins, and that offering Americans a check is a more fruitful political strategy than offering them the opportunity to take control of and responsibility for their own lives. This is what Oakeshott had in mind when he wrote that liberty was something that many people simply are not equipped to “enjoy as an opportunity rather than suffer as a burden.” For many years, Republicans have relied on Jude Wanniski’s “Two Santa Claus” theory, the strategy of using the promise of tax cuts to compete with Democrats’ promises of cash and other benefits. In part as a consequence of that strategy, a great many Americans pay little or no federal income taxes, while many of the other federal taxes they pay are indirect or partly hidden. Mitt Romney was right: You can’t use tax cuts to buy off people who are net recipients of tax transfers. Figuring out what we can offer them that is consistent with our principles is the task of conservatives between now and the next election. — Kevin D. Williamson is roving reporter for National Review. ||||| If his tweets are anything to go by, Donald Trump isn't a happy camper in the wake of President Barack Obama's victory over Republican challenger Mitt Romney in the 2012 election. \\"Well, back to the drawing board!\\" he posted tonight, followed by a series of increasingly disgruntled remarks. \\"We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty,\\" Trump continued. \\"Our nation is totally divided! Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us. This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy! ||||| Republicans never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. In 2010, they failed to win the Senate when it was theirs for the taking. Now they’ve lost the White House to President Obama, despite his poor record and the likelihood things won’t get any better in his second term. And they failed again to capture the Senate, though a takeover was initially thought to be a cinch. The result was a status quo election, with Democrats entrenched in White House and Senate and Republicans firmly in control of the House. As it turned out, the election wasn’t historic at all, except that Barack Obama, the first African American president, became the first to be reelected. The numbers and the faces in Washington have barely changed at all. We’re stuck with them. As hard as Republicans tried, they were unable to upset the balance of political forces. What’s their problem? In Senate races, it’s bad candidates: old hacks (Wisconsin), young hacks (Florida), youngsters (Ohio), Tea Party types who can’t talk about abortion sensibly (Missouri, Indiana), retreads (Virginia), lousy campaigners (North Dakota) and Washington veterans (Michigan). Losers all. And those are just the Senate contests decided yesterday. In 2010, it was similar. Republicans threw away two of their best chances to gain seats, choosing pathetically incapable candidates in Nevada and Delaware. It’s as if they have a political death wish. Losing the presidential contest to Obama was different. Mitt Romney was the best possible candidate among the Republicans who ran for the presidential nomination. He had baggage from his days as a corporate turnaround artist and liberal Republican governor. Yet he actually seemed presidential. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"This news article discusses the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election in which President Barack Obama was victorious over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The article highlights three main reasons for Romney's loss in the crucial state of Ohio: 1) Ohio's liking for crony capitalism like the automotive bailout, which was popular among middle-class workers, and allowed Obama to be seen as supporting their interests. 2) Class warfare tactics that swayed undecided voters with issues like Romney's low tax rate and painting him as the villain due to his wealth. 3) The fact that repealing Obamacare was not a deal-maker for people in Ohio, as many perceived it as something the administration was trying to do for them, despite not being completely sold on the idea. The article also mentions the failure of Republicans to gain control of the Senate in the 2012 elections, attributing it to bad candidates in various states. The inability to win the Senate and White House led to a status quo in politics, with Obama as the first African American President who was reelected and the House divided between Democrats and Republicans.

A: unfriendly B: warm inside C: lonely The answer is:","completion":"B: warm inside According to the given context, Aubrey is trying to get along with people who are making an effort to be friendly. This indicates that there is a positive interaction happening among the individuals, and they are putting in efforts to build a good rapport with each other. Under such circumstances, Aubrey would most likely feel positive emotions due to their attempts to be amicable and connect with others. Out of the three options provided: A: unfriendly - This answer is not consistent with the context, as Aubrey is trying to get along with others who are being friendly. It would be contradictory for Aubrey to feel unfriendly after attempting to build a positive relationship. B: warm inside - This answer best fits the context, as it reflects the positive emotions Aubrey is likely to feel after trying to establish a connection with friendly individuals. Feeling \\"warm inside\\" signifies inner happiness and contentment, stemming from the successful efforts to build strong relationships. C: lonely - This answer is not suitable, as the context suggests that efforts were made to establish a bond with others who are being friendly. Loneliness would indicate a lack of connection, which does not align with the described situation. In conclusion, the answer that best answers the question according to the context is B: warm inside. This alternative reflects the positive emotions that Aubrey would experience as a result of trying to get along with friendly individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"Foreign folk dancers are dressed in outfits of bright lime green, red and white tops, lime green headbands and red, blousy trousers and open-toed specialty shoes while dancing in a city street, while spectators enjoy the show.\\", can we conclude \\"Folk dancers are entertaining people on a city street.\\"?","completion":"Yes, we can indeed conclude that \\"Folk dancers are entertaining people on a city street.\\" The original statement is describing a scene where foreign folk dancers, specifically in brightly colored attire, are dancing in a city street. The costumes, which include bright lime green, red, and white tops, lime green headbands, red blousy trousers, and open-toed specialty shoes, indicate a festive and show-like scenario typically associated with performances or parades, composed to entertain an audience. Moreover, the statement mentions that there are spectators who are enjoying the show. This suggests that the activity is not merely a private or spontaneous dance by few individuals, but rather a performance meant to entertain a public audience. The word \\"spectators\\" derives its meaning from the act of spectating or observing - often associated with people in attendance at performances, sports events, or other public spectacles. The use of the term \\"city street\\" also adds to the understanding that this is a public event, possibly part of a parade or street performance. City streets often serve as venues for public gatherings, events, festivals, or shows due to their accessibility and visibility to a large number of people. Given these elements of the statement - the specific description of the dancers' outfits, their activity of dancing, the presence of spectators enjoying the show, and the location being a city street - we can therefore deduce that the folk dancers are indeed entertaining people on the city street. This conclusion is therefore a concise summary of the original statement, capturing the main activity - folk dancing as a form of entertainment for people in a city street."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: HIGH (Human Growth Hormone) could be the favorite drug at the next athletic world championships, and we might never know it. It is a natural substance produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Question: Which of these statements is WRONG? - HGH is a natural substance. - HGH is needed to help bones and muscles grow. - HGH is used as medicine for children. - HGH is not allowed to be produced in many countries. Answer:","completion":"The statement that is WRONG is - \\"HGH is not allowed to be produced in many countries.\\" The article clearly mentions that scientists are allowed to make the drug (HGH) and it is also legal to use the growth hormone in most countries. The information provided in the remaining options- HGH being a natural substance, its role in aiding the growth of bones and muscles, and its usage in medical treatments for children having growth issues, is accurate according to the article. The statement that HGH is not allowed to be produced in many countries contradicts the information present in the article, making it the incorrect option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The parents glanced up at us, then went back to praying quietly. The kids stared at the floor the whole time. I dropped Mia into a chair at the nurses' station and waited. Behind the glass wall in front of me, three nurses were talking about their various ex-husbands. It sounded like the same guy to me. I was still waiting for them to figure this out when one of them came over and asked, \\"What's the problem?\\" \\"No problem,\\" I said. \\"I just want to drop her off.\\" We both looked at Mia. A string of drool slowly slipped from her chin to her chest. \\"Has she been drinking?\\" the nurse asked. \\"I'm not really sure,\\" I said. The nurse looked back at me. \\"You're not really sure? Now what does that mean?\\" \\"I don't know,\\" I said. \\"I found her. I thought maybe I could leave her here.\\" \\"Sure, we'll just have to fill out the paperwork for that,\\" the nurse said.

In London, Murray beat both Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer on his way to a gold medal. He may have to beat the world's top two players in back-to-back matches again if he hopes to win his first Grand Slam title. Andy Murray of Great Britain hits a shot while practicing prior to the start of the 2012 U.S. Open on Friday. With Rafael Nadal out of this year's tournament due to injury, Murray moves into the No. 3 spot and could threaten the stranglehold that Djokovic, Federer and Nadal have held on Grand Slam trophies. The big three have won 29 of the last 30 Slams—although they rarely have had to beat both of the other big-three members in the same event. Djokovic accomplished the feat at last year's U.S. Open (beating Federer in the semifinal and Nadal in the final) and Nadal did it to win the 2008 French Open title. Federer, however, has never beaten both Djokovic and Nadal at the same Grand Slam event—although he beat Murray and Djokovic to win Wimbledon in July.

Andy Murray might have to beat these two great players again to win the U.S. Open. 4. Rafael Nadal, another top player, is not playing because he is hurt, so Murray has a better chance of winning. 5. The best players in tennis, Federer, Djokovic, and Nadal, have won almost all the big tournaments, so it's very hard for other players like Murray to win. 6.

(Since the late 19th century, musical setting of prose and free verse has also been practiced in some art music, though popular music tends to remain conservative in its retention of stanzaic forms with or without refrains.)

(April 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The movie opens with a brief flashback to the previous film as Father Constantine finds the Lexicon - the final book of God's prophecy and its continuing to write itself - in the catacombs of his church. When he keels over from a heart attack, now itâs up to a grad student, Allison (Kari WÃ¼hrer, reprising her role), to keep it from the forces of darkness. Cut to the streets of Bucharest. A young girl named Maria loses her ball into the busy street. Suddenly, Lucifer (reprised by John Light) appears to her and tells her she should go get it. Almost trancelike, she wanders into the street and as a result is run over by a vehicle. Allison witnesses the whole thing and runs to the little girl's side. The girl tells Allison she has a message for herâbut she cannot give it to her yet. On her way down, Allison brushed into Dylan (Jason Scott Lee) who was standing at the entrance to her apartment building. We next see him sitting in a dark room assembling and loading his gun.

It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house.

An invalid argument is a phrase that cannot be interpreted as an argument or not on the topic of death penalty. Problem:The final argument against the death penalty is that it is inhumane. Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Identifying the main claim in the argument The main claim in this argument is that \\"the death penalty is inhumane.\\" Step 2: Evaluating if the argument is clearly interpretable This argument is clear in its meaning and intent, as it expresses the belief that the death penalty involves treatment or actions that are cruel or unjust to those facing it. Step 3: Determining if the argument can be used as a premise or a conclusion This argument can potentially be used as both a premise and a conclusion. As a premise, it can be used to support the conclusion that the death penalty should be abolished or replaced with an alternative form of punishment. As a conclusion, it can be supported by various premises discussing various inhumane aspects of the death penalty, like the potential for executing an innocent person, the suffering involved in certain execution methods, or the arbitrary nature of its application.

The main thrust of the narrative arises from a 'homily' spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. In it, the future course of the marriage is spelled out, which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life. The 'moral' of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out, both now, and in the past, it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends. This film was a relative blockbuster by domestic Italian standards. It's a terrible shame that this film is not available in either DVD or VHS.","completion":"The sentiment of the given review can be described as primarily positive with some elements of negative sentiment.

Write an article based on this summary: Apply a cutting compound to your buffing tool.","completion":"Title: The Power of Cutting Compounds and Proper Buffing Techniques Introduction Paint scratches, oxidation, and minor imperfections on your vehicle's surface can be a nuisance, not to mention a major eyesore. Fortunately, there's a way to handle these issues - by using a cutting compound on your buffing tool. This technique essentially removes a thin layer of paint to reveal a fresh, untouched surface underneath which looks much cleaner and is free from blemishes. In this article, we will discuss the importance of applying a cutting compound to your buffing tool, how to choose the right one, and the proper techniques to give your vehicle a renewed shine. Why use a cutting compound? A cutting compound is a specialized abrasive paste that, when used in conjunction with a buffing tool, will remove minor scratches, paint defects, and other surface imperfections. Additionally, it serves to reduce signs of oxidation, restoring your vehicle's paint job to its original brilliance. In the hands of an experienced user, a cutting compound can work wonders – however, it's important to follow the correct techniques and procedures to avoid damaging your vehicle's paintwork. Choosing the Right Cutting Compound Cutting compounds come in various forms, with some being more aggressive than others. For beginners, it's best to start with a lighter compound to ensure that you don't inadvertently harm your vehicle's surface. Once you become more proficient in using a cutting compound, you can then graduate to heavier formulas. Some popular cutting compounds include: 1. Meguiar's Ultimate Compound: This versatile compound provides a high level of abrasion while remaining safe for clear coats. It's ideal for removing moderate oxidations, scratches, and swirl marks. 2. Chemical Guys V32 Optical Grade Extreme Compound: This innovative formula is designed for use on both conventional clear coats and harder ceramic clears. It works well for removing scratches, swirl marks, and light oxidation. 3. 3M Perfect-It Rubbing Compound: With advanced technology that provides cutting power while leaving a fine finish, this compound works great for addressing imperfections in a vehicle's paintwork. Preparing Your Buffing Tool Before you start buffing, ensure that you have the proper supplies and equipment, including: 1. A high-quality rotary or dual-action buffer 2. The appropriate cutting compound for your needs 3. A foam or wool buffing pad 4. A microfiber towel for wiping residue Applying the Cutting Compound to Your Buffing Tool Follow these steps to correctly apply the cutting compound to your buffing tool: 1. Attach the buffing pad to your buffer. If you're using a foam pad, you may need to spray it with a little water or a pad conditioner to dampen it slightly. 2. Apply a moderate amount of cutting compound onto your buffing pad. Start with a conservative amount, as too much compound can create a messy process and reduce its effectiveness. 3. Spread the compound evenly across the buffing pad, taking care to distribute it uniformly so that the pad makes consistent contact with your vehicle's surface. 4. Adjust your buffer's speed setting according to the manufacturer's recommendations for the cutting compound you are using. Some compounds require a slower buffing speed, while others may necessitate a higher speed. 5. With your buffer turned off, press the buffing pad against the vehicle's surface to distribute the compound across the area you'll be working on. Be sure to target the imperfections you want to remove. 6. Turn on your buffer and start working the compound into your vehicle's surface using slow, controlled motions. Keep the buffing pad flat and maintain consistent pressure throughout the process. 7. Evaluate your progress periodically, and apply more compound to the buffing pad as needed. 8. Once you are satisfied with the results, wipe off any excess residue using a microfiber towel. Conclusion The use of cutting compounds with your buffing tool is an effective and efficient way of addressing paint imperfections and restoring your vehicle's exterior to its original glory. By identifying the right type of compound, preparing your buffing tool, and following the correct application techniques, you can achieve a professional finish that will leave your car looking as good as new."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The Bumbo cocktail and Clover Club cocktail are two distinct cocktails with unique ingredients, flavor profiles, and histories. Here's a detailed comparison between the two: 1. Origin and history: Bumbo: Bumbo, also known as Bombo or Bumboo, dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries. It was commonly consumed by pirates and sailors, particularly in the Caribbean region. The beverage is said to have been used as a means to make drinking highly potent and less flavorful rum more enjoyable at that time. Clover Club: The Clover Club cocktail has its roots in the late 19th century to early 20th century, originating from an elite social club in Philadelphia called the Clover Club. This pre-prohibition classic gained popularity at the club and eventually entered mainstream drinking culture. 2. Ingredients: Bumbo: - Dark rum (traditionally Caribbean rum) - Sugar or simple syrup - Freshly grated nutmeg - Water - Lime juice (optional) Clover Club: - Gin - Fresh lemon or lime juice - Raspberry syrup or grenadine - Egg white - Dry vermouth (optional) 3. Flavor profile: Bumbo: Bumbo has a rich, sweet, and spicy taste reminiscent of its Caribbean origins. The core flavors are derived from the rum, sugar, and nutmeg, with a possible hint of citrus from lime juice if included. Clover Club: The Clover Club cocktail offers a well-balanced combination of sweet, tart, and fruity flavors. It is characterized by the botanical taste of gin, complemented by the acidity of citrus juice, the sweetness of raspberry syrup or grenadine, and the velvety texture of the egg white foam. 4. Preparation: Bumbo: - Combine rum, sugar/simple syrup, and water in a glass. - Stir until the sugar dissolves. - Optionally, add lime juice to taste. - Top with freshly grated nutmeg and serve. Clover Club: - In a cocktail shaker, combine gin, lemon/lime juice, raspberry syrup/grenadine, and egg white. - Perform a dry shake (without ice) to froth the egg white and emulsify the ingredients. - Add ice to the shaker, and shake again to chill. - Strain into a chilled coupe or cocktail glass. - Optionally, garnish with fresh raspberries or a lemon twist. In conclusion, Bumbo is a dark rum-based beverage with a sweet and spicy profile, enjoyed mostly by pirates and sailors in history, while the Clover Club is a classic pre-prohibition era cocktail based on gin with a balanced fruity, citrusy, and creamy taste."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The economy of the town is mostly agricultural, and the town is surrounded by vast cornfields. One particular year the corn crop fails and the people of Gatlin turn to prayer in an attempt to ensure a successful harvest. A mysterious boy preacher, Isaac Chroner (John Franklin), arrives and takes all the children of Gatlin into a cornfield to speak to them about the prophecies of a demonic version of the Judeo-Christian God called \\"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\\". Isaac, through his lieutenant Malachai (Courtney Gains), leads the children of the town in a revolution, brutally killing all of the adults in the town. Over the ensuing years, the children take any adults passing through as sacrifices.Three years later, Burt (Peter Horton) and his girlfriend Vicky (Linda Hamilton) pass through Nebraska while driving cross-country to Burt's new job as a physician in Seattle, Washington. They are traveling in their car and hit a small boy out on the highway. This boy was one of the Gatlin children who tried to escape the iron hand of the death cult. The couple place his body in the trunk. They encounter an old mechanic, who is little to no help, as the children of Gatlin have employed him to lead all adults passing through to the town, but they betray him and kill him anyway.

Please answer the following question: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Two coastal Canadian towns, Hammond and Soundville decided to start sand mining to bring more money to their budgets. A few months later however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income. they wanted to protect the environment. Which village harmed fewer corals? Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, I will consider the information given about each village and their respective actions. Step 1: Analyze the provided facts about sand mining and its impact on the environment, particularly corals. - Sand mining directly causes erosion and negatively affects local wildlife, including corals. - Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes water turbidity, which is harmful to corals. Step 2: Examine the actions taken by the two villages, Hammond and Soundville. - Both Hammond and Soundville started sand mining operations. - A few months later, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations to protect the environment. Step 3: Evaluate the potential harm to corals from each village. - Both villages engaged in sand mining, which is harmful to corals. - Hammond stopped mining operations sooner than Soundville, resulting in less time for their actions to affect corals. Based on these steps, I can conclude that Hammond likely harmed fewer corals than Soundville, as they stopped their mining operations earlier to protect the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: Add an ornament to a wrist cuff. How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of adding an ornament to a wrist cuff, you can follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather materials: Before beginning the project, gather all the materials you'll need. These may include: - A wrist cuff (preferably made from a durable material like leather, metal, or fabric) - The ornament(s) you wish to add (e.g. beads, crystals, charms, etc.) - Needle and thread (or glue, if the ornament requires it) - Pliers (for attaching jump rings) - Jump rings (if your ornaments require them) - Ruler or measuring tape - Marker or chalk 2. Choose the ornament's design and placement: Decide on the design of the ornament and how you want it placed on the wrist cuff. Sketch out a rough design on paper so you have a visual reference when working on the actual piece. Use the ruler or measuring tape to measure the dimensions of the cuff and decide where the ornament(s) should be positioned. 3. Mark your measurements: Once you've chosen the ornament's placement, use the marker or chalk to transfer those measurements to the cuff. Be sure to measure accurately, so the outcome matches your vision. 4. Attach the ornament(s): a) Sewing: If the ornament is a bead, sequin, or any type of sewable embellishment, thread the needle with a thread that matches the cuff or ornament's color. Carefully sew the ornament to the cuff, following the pattern or design you previously planned. Make sure to secure each stitch with a knot, so the ornament doesn't come loose over time. In case the ornament has a sewing loop, simply pass the thread through the loop and then sew it to the cuff. b) Jump rings: If the ornament is a charm or requires a jump ring for attachment, use the pliers to open the jump ring by gently twisting its ends apart (don't pull them apart). Thread the charm onto the jump ring, then loop the ring through a hole, loop or other attachment point on the cuff. Finally, close the jump ring by twisting the ends back together. c) Glue: If the ornament needs to be glued, apply a small amount of strong adhesive, like E6000 or super glue, to the back of the ornament. Carefully press it onto the desired spot on the cuff, and hold it in place until the glue sets. Follow the glue's curing time instructions for best results. 5. Check your work: Once the ornament(s) is attached, inspect your handiwork, ensuring everything is securely fastened, and the design matches your initial vision. If you find any loose strands of thread, trim them to ensure a clean and polished finish. 6. Allow time for adhesive to cure: If you used glue to attach the ornaments, it's crucial to let the adhesive cure for the recommended time (usually 24 hours) before wearing or handling the wrist cuff. The curing time ensures a strong bond between the ornament and the wrist cuff. 7. Wear and enjoy: Now that you have successfully added your ornament(s) to the wrist cuff, you can confidently wear your unique piece of jewelry. By following these steps, you will have successfully accomplished your goal of adding an ornament to a wrist cuff, creating a distinctive accessory that reflects your personal style."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was part of the activities of Beijing Design Week, which ran from September 26 to October 3 in 2013. The Rubber Duck stayed in the park until September 23, then moved to the Summer Palace, a famous Beijing tourist spot, where it was on display until October 26. The duck is made of over 200 pieces of rubber. It was guarded not only by staff, but also by 10 volunteers wearing yellow T-shirts and hats with a rubber duck logo. Sun Yidong, a volunteer who guided visitors to the duck, said the art brought energy to the traditional Chinese park. \\"Seeing the giant Rubber Duck makes me feel like I'm a kid again.\\" Sun said. Because of the rain on Friday, there were not too many people coming to see it. The Expo workers said they expected more people to come and visit the duck on weekends.

Options: - winch - factory - roller coaster - ship - building The answer is \\"factory\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"factory\\" because a factory is where raw materials, such as steel, are processed and converted into finished products, such as steel cables. Since you are looking for a steel cable that has not been completed yet, it is most likely still in the stages of manufacturing or processing. In a factory, steel cables undergo various stages of production before they are considered complete. These stages include using machines to twist and form the steel strands into a cable, as well as adding any necessary coatings or reinforcements. Once the steel cable is fully manufactured, it can be shipped out to its final destination - whether that be to a winch, roller coaster, ship, or building site. All of the other options mentioned are end-users or applications of steel cables, where the cables are utilized once they have already been completed. A winch uses steel cables for pulling heavy objects, a roller coaster uses them to pull and support cars along the tracks, ships use steel cables for hoisting and securing loads, and buildings may use steel cables for support and tension purposes in their structures. Hence, to find a steel cable that is not yet complete, your best bet would be to visit a factory where these cables are still being processed and manufactured."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Instead of immediately resorting to expensive cleaning products or professional cleaning services, try using some common everyday household items to tackle these issues. In this article, we will explore how to remove various types of stains using nail polish remover, rubbing alcohol, baking soda, toothpaste, lemon juice, and cream of tartar. 1. Remove stains with nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol For most stains, like ink, coffee, or paint, nail polish remover and rubbing alcohol can be your best friends. These two items are highly effective in breaking down the compounds in the stain, making them easier to clean. Step 1: Dampen a clean cotton ball or cloth with nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol. Step 2: Gently press the dampened cotton ball or cloth onto the stained area. Step 3: Blot until the stain begins to lift. Step 4: Rinse the item thoroughly to ensure no residue is left behind. Note: Perform a spot test on a hidden area of the material to ensure that it won't be damaged by the nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol. 2. Remove grease stains with baking soda Grease stains can be challenging to remove from clothing, but baking soda offers an inexpensive and effective solution. Step 1: If the stain is still wet, use a paper towel to absorb as much grease as possible. Step 2: Generously sprinkle baking soda onto the grease stain, completely covering it. Step 3: Let the baking soda sit for 30 minutes to an hour, allowing it to absorb the grease. Step 4: Brush off the baking soda and launder the item as usual. 3. Use toothpaste to clean leather shoes Toothpaste, especially the non-gel kind, is excellent for removing dirt and scuffs from leather shoes. Step 1: Apply a small amount of toothpaste to a soft cloth or an old toothbrush. Step 2: Gently scrub the stained or scuffed area in a circular motion, being careful not to apply too much pressure. Step 3: Wipe away the toothpaste with a damp cloth. Step 4: Buff the leather with a dry cloth to restore its shine. 4. Make a lemon juice and cream of tartar cleaner Lemon juice and cream of tartar can be combined to create a natural, powerful cleaner that can remove stains, grime, and rust from various surfaces. Step 1: Mix equal parts lemon juice and cream of tartar in a small bowl until it forms a paste. Step 2: Apply a layer of the paste to the stained area. Step 3: Let the paste sit for 10-15 minutes. Step 4: Scrub the area with a cloth or soft brush, then rinse away the paste residue. Conclusion By using these simple everyday household items, you can save money and effectively deal with various stubborn stains. Additionally, remember always to perform a spot test on a hidden area to ensure the material will not be damaged by these cleaning agents.

Carson Wentz found tight end Zach Ertz for a 1-yard touchdown in the back of the end zone off of a bootleg pass, and Jalen Mills intercepted rookie QB C.J. Beathard and returned it 37 yards for a touchdown.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: On Earth, the common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity). Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes. Now, I have a new situation: Two continents were separated by a large ocean. Oceania had milder weather and experienced common weather phenomena, while Lemuria experienced natural disasters. Answer this question please: Which continent experienced fog phenomena? A:","completion":"A: Based on the given information, Oceania experienced milder weather and common weather phenomena. Since fog is considered a common weather phenomenon, it is more likely that Oceania experienced fog phenomena."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The information provided rather supports the idea that he was indeed a singer-songwriter. It does not offer any information suggesting that he did not compose or write his songs. In the context provided, Benny Bell is described as an \\"American singer-songwriter,\\" indicating he was both a singer and a songwriter; thus, the assumption would be that he played a role in writing his songs. Moreover, it states that he \\"reached popularity in the 1940s, with a comeback in the 1970s,\\" which indicates his career spanned across several decades, implying his skills and abilities as a singer-songwriter might have contributed to his success. Additionally, it is mentioned that \\"he is particularly remembered for his risqué but cheerfully optimistic songs,\\" suggesting that his songwriting was a significant aspect of his legacy. If he were not involved in writing his songs, it would be unlikely for his songwriting style to be specifically attributed to him. Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no evidence or reason to believe that Benny Bell did not write his songs.

For the most part, rebuilding projects were poorly planned and supervised, with American managers operating \\"in a vacuum\\" and little Iraqi input, according to one Iraqi official.

The New York Times highlights that the majority of reconstruction projects were poorly planned and supervised, with American managers making decisions \\"in a vacuum\\" and with little to no input from Iraqis. One unidentified Iraqi official quoted in the report claimed that American-driven rebuilding initiatives often failed to take local needs and desires into account. Consequently, vast amounts of money and resources were expended on projects that held little value for the intended beneficiaries. Despite some positive outcomes, such as the refurbishment of the Port of Umm Qasr, the overall consensus from \\"Learning From Iraq\\" is that \\"too much money was spent with too few results,\\" as stated by James Jeffrey, the American ambassador in Iraq from 2010 to 2012. The report further criticizes President Obama's decision to withdraw troops from the country in December 2011, suggesting that the premature end of US presence limited America's ability to prevent the Iraqi government from making detrimental decisions. Leon Panetta, former Secretary of Defense under the Obama administration, is quoted as saying that the withdrawal of troops caused the loss of much-needed leverage to stop the Iraqi government from \\"going off a cliff.\\" Details of the report can be found on the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction's website.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Given the background: The two adrenal glands are located above the kidneys. Each gland has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the link below. and the situation: John is a biologist, who studies animal species of tundra biome. He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B. Answer the following question: Which process may not help the species during emergencies, process A or process B? Answer:","completion":"Process A may not help the species during emergencies when compared to process B. To understand why, let us first examine the differences between the two processes. Process A is associated with the secretion of hormones from the adrenal gland's cortex, which produces hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. These hormones have essential roles in the body, but they do not directly prepare the body for emergencies. Cortisol helps the body handle stress by regulating the body's use of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. It is also involved in controlling inflammation, maintaining blood pressure, and increasing blood sugar levels. Aldosterone, on the other hand, helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body, such as sodium and potassium, which is important for maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance. Process B is linked to the secretion of hormones from the adrenal gland's medulla, which produces fight-or-flight hormones like adrenaline (also known as epinephrine). Adrenaline is specifically designed to prepare the body to respond to emergencies by altering various physiological processes in the body. For example, it increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, which leads to a sudden burst of energy. It also increases heart rate, constricts blood vessels, and enhances focus and alertness, all of which are essential elements to act quickly in emergency situations. Based on these explanations, it is clear that process B (the secretion of hormones from the adrenal gland's medulla) is more directly aimed at preparing the body to deal with emergencies. Although process A (the secretion of hormones from the adrenal gland's cortex) has important functions, it does not have the immediate, emergency-focused effects that process B offers. Therefore, process A may not be as helpful for the species during emergencies as process B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was not formally trained but gifted? At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in...

Write an article based on this summary: Nigeria's Ogoniland region could take 30 years to recover fully from the damage caused by years of oil spills, a long-awaited UN report says. Article:","completion":"Title: The Long Road to Recovery- Ogoniland's 30-Year Battle with Oil Spill Aftermath A recent report from the United Nations (UN) has brought to light the disturbing and distressing fact that it could take up to 30 years for Nigeria's Ogoniland region to overcome the extensive damage caused by years of frequent oil spills. Once a flourishing, biodiverse region inhabited by several indigenous communities, Ogoniland now stands as a painful reminder of the devastating implications of oil pollution. The distinct geographical identity of Ogoniland, located in the Niger Delta, has been severely compromised due to toxic contamination from oil spills. These spills have unleashed a catastrophic environmental crisis, plaguing the region for decades. The UN report, a result of comprehensive research and data analysis over the years, observes that the path to a complete recovery can only be envisaged on a 30-year timeline, given the extent of the damage incurred. The oil spills, negligence, and associated events have resulted in the loss of livelihood for the local communities, impacting their health and stripping the land of its natural resources. Ogoniland, once known for its rich soil that supported agriculture and fishing, has seen its primary sources of sustenance severely crippled. The role of oil companies that have been operating in the region cannot be overlooked in this context. These spills are frequently attributed to sabotage, operational failures, lack of proper mitigative measures, and inadequate responses to these disasters. The region has borne witness to some significant spills, high-profile litigation and strained relations between the oil companies, local communities, and the Nigerian government over the years. The UN's intervention and the resulting report have helped shed light on the extent of the problem and the urgency with which solutions need to be sought. According to the report, \\"The environmental restoration of Ogoniland could prove to be the world's most wide-ranging and long term oil clean-up exercise ever undertaken if contaminated drinking water, land, creeks and important ecosystems such as mangroves are to be brought back to full, productive health.\\" Nevertheless, the road to recovery is long and fraught with challenges. Firstly, there is the Herculean task of cleaning up contaminated soil and bodies of water. The UN report highlights the need for immediate action in providing clean drinking water to local communities that do not have access to the same, given the large scale of water poisoning. Threats posed to public health due to associated diseases are equally worrying. The revitalization of agriculture and fishing, other essential livelihood sources for locals, will require systematic planning and tremendous effort. Programs need to be developed that not only restore these sectors but also safeguard them against future mishaps. Additionally, issues of corporate accountability and governance also come to the fore in this context. Oil companies operating in the region need to reevaluate their operational practices, commit to higher safety standards and assume greater responsibility in preventing such mishaps in the future. There must be a shift toward sustainable practices along with transparency in corporate actions. As per the UN report, the recovery of Ogoniland is a long-term project that requires robust planning, adequate resources, cohesive effort from various stakeholders, and sustained commitment. It also necessitates a shared sense of responsibility and a collective aspiration towards restoration. In conclusion, Ogoniland's journey to recovery from the environmental devastation will be a long one, marked by considerable challenges. However, with persistent efforts championed by the UN, the Nigerian government, local communities, and oil companies, it's a journey that needs to be undertaken to repair the ecology and reinstate the economic stability of the region. It's a daunting task but not an insurmountable one. The healing of Ogoniland is indeed, as the UN report underscores, a paramount responsibility for humanity. Only in fulfilling this duty can we hope to restore Ogoniland to its rightful state of environmental balance and vibrant life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

For example, diseases involving fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, or larger populations in certain circumstances are subject to the Orphan Drug Act. Because medical research and development of drugs to treat such diseases is financially disadvantageous, companies that do so are rewarded with tax reductions, fee waivers, and market exclusivity on that drug for a limited time (seven years), regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents. The answer is:","completion":"The most common method for any type of manufacturer to gain market exclusivity, particularly within the context provided, is through the development of drugs to treat rare diseases, commonly referred to as \\"orphan diseases\\". Companies that take on the challenging task of medical research and drug development for such diseases, that are financially disadvantageous due to smaller patient populations, are awarded with a system of incentives that includes market exclusivity on the developed drug for a limited time (seven years in the context) regardless of the drug's patent status. Additionally, these companies also benefit from tax reductions and fee waivers. The reference example is from the United States application of the Orphan Drug Act, a law specifically designed to encourage the development of drugs for diseases involving fewer than 200,000 patients, or larger populations in certain circumstances. This method stands as a strategy for manufacturers to gain exclusive rights to market their products.

Apply to a hot grill and allow to cook for three minutes, then flip the steak and cook for three more minutes. Explanation: The other option is incorrect because it says \\"flip the grill\\" instead of flipping the steak. Flipping the entire grill would not be practical or possible in most cases and would not help in cooking the steak evenly. In the correct answer, flipping the steak ensures that both sides of the steak are cooked for the same amount of time, allowing for even cooking and better results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thus, Na+ is the sodium ion, Al3+ is the aluminum ion, Ca2+ is the calcium ion, and so forth. We have seen that some elements lose different numbers of electrons, producing ions of different charges (Figure 3.3 \\"Predicting Ionic Charges\\"). Iron, for example, can form two cations, each of which, when combined with the same anion, makes a different compound with unique physical and chemical properties. Thus, we need a different name for each iron ion to distinguish Fe2+ from Fe3+. The same issue arises for other ions with more than one possible charge. There are two ways to make this distinction. In the simpler, more modern approach, called the Stock system, an ion’s positive charge is indicated by a roman numeral in parentheses after the element name, followed by the word ion. Thus, Fe2+ is called the iron(II) ion, while Fe3+ is called the iron(III) ion. This system is used only for elements that form more than one common positive ion. We do not call the Na+ ion the sodium(I) ion because (I) is unnecessary. Sodium forms only a 1+ ion, so there is no ambiguity about the name sodium ion. The second system, called the common system, is not conventional but is still prevalent and used in the health sciences. This system recognizes that many metals have two common cations. The common system uses two suffixes (-ic and -ous) that are appended to the stem of the element name. The -ic suffix represents the greater of the two cation charges, and the -ous suffix represents the lower one. In many cases, the stem of the element name comes from the Latin name of the element. Table 3.2 \\"The Common System of Cation Names\\" lists the elements that use the common system, along with their respective cation names. Table 3.2 The Common System of Cation Names.

To move the 325, we will subtract it from both sides of the equation. This is like taking away 325 marbles from both sides of a balance to keep it even. So now we have: 257 - 325 = -17*g When we subtract 325 from 257, we get: -68 = -17*g Now we need to find g. To do this, we'll divide both sides by -17, which is like sharing -68 cookies among -17 friends. -68 ÷ -17 = g Once we divide -68 by -17, we get: g = 4 So, g equals 4!

Lorraine Bracco is an American actress who gained recognition for her captivating performances on television and in film. She was born on October 2, 1954, in Brooklyn, New York. After beginning her career as a fashion model in France, she transitioned to acting in the early 1980s. Bracco made her cinematic debut in 1980 with a small role in the French film \\"Duos sur canapé.\\" She appeared in a few more European films before returning to the United States and securing American film roles such as in \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" (1987) and \\"The Dream Team\\" (1989). Her big breakthrough came when she received critical acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for her role as Karen Hill in the iconic Mafia film \\"Goodfellas\\" (1990), directed by Martin Scorsese. This role pushed her acting career to new heights and increased her visibility in Hollywood. However, it was her portrayal of Dr. Jennifer Melfi, an empathetic and rational psychiatrist, on the HBO series \\"The Sopranos\\" (1999-2007) that earned her widespread recognition. This groundbreaking television series, created by David Chase, focuses on the life and relationships of mob boss Tony Soprano, portrayed by James Gandolfini. Bracco's role in \\"The Sopranos\\" earned her multiple Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress and has cemented her place among the finest actors on television. In 2007, Lorraine Bracco appeared in the television film \\"Snowglobe,\\" a fantasy Christmas movie starring Christina Milian. Bracco played the role of Rose, the protagonist's mother. The film follows the protagonist Angela (played by Milian) as she discovers a magical snow globe that transports her into a winter wonderland where she has the opportunity to experience an ideal Christmas. Apart from her influential roles in \\"Goodfellas\\" and \\"The Sopranos,\\" Bracco has appeared in numerous other films and television shows, including \\"Basketball Diaries\\" (1995), \\"Riding in Cars with Boys\\" (2001), and the reality show \\"Rizzoli & Isles\\" (2010-2016), which starred Angie Harmon and Sasha Alexander. With a successful career spanning over three decades, Lorraine Bracco has established herself as a versatile and respected actress in Hollywood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer. While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, what is your weight in newtons? An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force. Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon? [Figure 3] After reading the above, is \\"Mass is the amount of matter and weight is the force of gravity on the object\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What's the difference between weight and mass?\\"? Choices: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"b). yes; The correct answer is \\"yes\\". The statement \\"Mass is the amount of matter and weight is the force of gravity on the object\\" is indeed the correct difference between weight and mass. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object, usually measured in kilograms. In contrast, weight is the force on an object due to gravity and is commonly measured in newtons on Earth. While mass remains constant across different gravitational fields, weight can change as gravity changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The empire had managed to control nearly all former Byzantine lands surrounding the city, but in 1402 the Byzantines were temporarily relieved when the Turco-Mongol leader Timur, founder of the Timurid Empire, invaded Anatolia from the east. In the Battle of Ankara in 1402, Timur defeated the Ottoman forces and took Sultan Bayezid I as a prisoner, throwing the empire into disorder. The ensuing civil war lasted from 1402 to 1413 as Bayezid's sons fought over succession.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - You speak into the receiver on your phone - Sound waves move parts inside the receiver - Movement causes the magnet inside to produce eletricity - Electricity is transferred through a wire or cable - A membrane in the other persons phone is vibrated by the magnet in their telephone - Sound is produced A:","completion":"The final step of the process is the sound reproduction at the other person's phone, which allows them to hear and understand the message being conveyed. This is accomplished through the following sequence of events: 1. You speak into the receiver on your phone, and your voice generates sound waves. 2. The sound waves produced by your voice cause the diaphragm inside the receiver to vibrate. 3. These vibrations cause a magnet (attached to the diaphragm) to move back and forth within a coil of wire, generating an electrical current that corresponds to the original sound wave. 4. This electrical current is then transferred through a wire or cable (in the case of a landline phone) or is converted into a digital signal and transmitted wirelessly (in the case of a mobile or VoIP phone). 5. If the call is landline-to-landline, the signal is transferred through a series of cables and telephone exchanges. If the call is made using a mobile phone or VoIP service, the signal is transmitted via a network of cell towers or through the internet, respectively, before ultimately reaching the recipient's phone. 6. Upon reaching the other person's phone, the electrical current or digital signal is converted back into an analog signal (if necessary, in the case of digital transmission). This signal is then amplified and sent to the earpiece of their phone. 7. Inside the earpiece of the recipient's phone, there is a diaphragm (usually a small cone-shaped component) attached to a magnet. The electrical current or analog signal is used to create a magnetic field that causes the magnet and attached diaphragm to vibrate at specific frequencies that correspond to the incoming signal. 8. As the diaphragm vibrates, it generates sound waves that reproduce your voice with a high degree of fidelity. These sound waves travel through the air and ultimately reach the ears of the person on the other end of the call, allowing them to hear and understand the message you conveyed through your initial speech. This complex process ultimately allows for real-time communication between individuals over vast distances, making it possible for people to keep in touch with friends, family members, and colleagues around the world with relative ease."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: A month went by in this manner , but a month was all I could bear . The memory of Marguerite accompanied me wherever I went . I had loved that woman --- still loved her --- too much for her suddenly to mean nothing to me . Whatever feelings I might have for her now , I had to see her again . At once . ... I knew Marguerite . Meeting me so unexpectedly must have thrown her into a state of great confusion . Probably , she had heard of my departure which had set her mind at rest as to the consequences of our sudden parting . But , seeing me back and coming face to face with me , pale as I was , she had sensed that my return had a purpose , and must have wondered what was going to happen . If , when I saw her again , Marguerite had been unhappy ; if , in taking my revenge , there had also been some way of helping her , then I might well have forgiven her , and would certainly never have dreamed of doing her any harm . But when I saw her again , she was happy , at least on the surface . Another man had ensured her the luxury in which I had been unable to keep her . She brought shame both to my pride and my love ; she was going to have to pay for what I had suffered . I could not remain indifferent to what she did now . It followed that the thing that would hurt her most would be exactly for me to show indifference . Indifference , therefore , was the feeling which I now needed to pretend , not only in her presence but in the eyes of others . I tried to put a smile on my face , and I went to call on Prudence with whom Marguerite was staying . Prudence saw me to the door , and I returned to my apartment with tears of anger in my eyes and thirst for revenge in my heart and thought only of finding a way to make the poor creature suffer . Question: What kind of feelings did the hero most probably have ? Answer: A:","completion":"The hero in this story appears to harbor a mix of complex emotions towards Marguerite. They primarily include love, confusion, humiliation, indignance, anger, desire for revenge, and a need to feign indifference. Even after a month of separation, the hero's love for Marguerite hadn't waned, suggesting a deep emotional attachment. Seeing her again, however, stirred up a whirlwind of distressing emotions. Discovering Marguerite in a state of happiness, in the arms of another man and enjoying a life of luxury presumably provided by this man, triggered feelings of humiliation and a bruised ego. The hero also felt indignance at the perceived betrayal by Marguerite – she seemed to not reciprocate the love he still held for her and appeared to have moved on easily. This greatly upset the hero, spawning a rage within him and a thirst for vengeance, which highlights an undercurrent of anger he held towards her. He wished to make her suffer for the heartache he underwent. Despite these intensely negative feelings, the hero understood that showing his true emotions would not be beneficial. The best way, he believed, to cause Marguerite pain was to demonstrate indifference towards her. This required him to suppress his actual feelings and pretend as though he was not bothered at all by her actions. This emotional turmoil between his genuine feelings and the need to seem indifferent highlights his state of inner conflict."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: The Southeast Asian ministers gather in Laos for their regional meeting. Hypothesis: Southeast Asian ministers' meeting is held in Laos.","completion":"Yes, based on the provided context, we can draw the hypothesis that the Southeast Asian ministers' meeting is being held in Laos. The context specifically mentions that the Southeast Asian ministers gather in Laos for their regional meeting. This statement alone gives us enough information to form the hypothesis. Let's break down the context to understand further: 1. \\"The Southeast Asian ministers\\" - This refers to a group of government representatives or decision-makers from Southeast Asian nations. Southeast Asia is a region comprising 11 countries: Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. 2. \\"gather in Laos\\" - This indicates that these ministers or representatives from the Southeast Asian nations are converging in one location, which is Laos. Laos is a Southeast Asian country itself, making it an appropriate location for such a regional meeting. 3. \\"for their regional meeting\\" - This implies that the ministers have an assembly or meeting intended to address or discuss issues relevant to the Southeast Asian region as a whole. Taking all these points into consideration, the context strongly supports the hypothesis that the Southeast Asian ministers' meeting is being held in Laos. These meetings typically involve member countries discussing various regional cooperation matters, such as trade, economics, security, cultural exchange, or environmental conservation. Additionally, these meetings can also serve as a platform for the nations to address current or emerging global challenges and foster unity and collaboration across the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: If a wet diaper is worn for a long time, or if urine and/or stool irritate the infant’s skin, diaper rash can result. An infant’s bottom or genitals may become red and sore, causing discomfort and irritability. However, the condition can be easily treated at home. Usually, diaper rash will be avoided or disappear within twenty-four hours if: Diapers are changed frequently The infant’s skin is washed carefully A non-prescription diaper ointment is applied at diaper changes This condition, called jaundice, is common in infants and is not usually associated with a disease or problem. It may cause yellowing of the skin, or orange or greenish in some cases. It may show up 24 hours after birth and peak at about 72 hours. It appears because an infant builds up a substance called bilirubin, and can have a number of causes ranging from not getting enough breast milk to the newborn having an immature liver. Usually, jaundice will clear on its own within a few days, but frequent feeding (every 2-3 hours) and a phototherapy treatment are also be recommended: Phototherapy treatments expose the infant to light, which helps to eliminate bilirubin. Your physician will explain what phototherapy to use, if one is deemed necessary. Light tan spots (sometimes called café-au-lait spots) may appear at birth or develop in a child’s first few years. If many of these spots (or especially large ones) are present, your doctor will monitor your child, since they may be a sign of a condition called neurofibromatosis. There may be moles present on your newborn, called congenital nevi. These can vary in size: they may be as small as a pea, or large enough to cover an entire limb. Your doctor will inspect and monitor nevi, since large ones have a greater risk of becoming skin cancer. Port wine stains (large purple-red patches) are often harmless, but could be a symptom of an underlying issue such as Sturge-Weber syndrome or Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. Fat necrosis is a movable lump underneath the surface that appears on some infants. Though fat necrosis is often benign and will go away on its own within a few weeks, your doctor will want to examine the lump to make sure that it is not related to another condition (such as renal disease or hypercalcemia). If your newborn’s skin is bluish all over (cyanosis), let your physician know right away. This could indicate that your newborn’s blood is not circulating properly, or be a sign of a heart problem. If you feel that your baby is acting unusually, or if he or she develops unexplained skin conditions, talk to your physician, especially if you notice: Pain, swelling, or warmth in an area of your baby’s skin Red streaks extending from an area on his or her skin Pus Swollen lymph nodes Fever (38°C / 100.4°F or higher) Your baby is unusually fussy Summary:","completion":"Diaper rash can result from wearing a wet diaper for too long or from skin irritation, causing redness and soreness in the infant's bottom or genitals.

We tried a lot of samples, but didn't play with the toys much this visit. We went to gets some cheese for the cheese fair on Wednesday at my daughter's after school program. So naturally, what would take me five minutes turned into half an hour. I picked up a pack of Babybel Cheese for the cheese fest and headed to the cashiers. As usual, there was a longer-than-the-supermarket wait. It's finally my turn, and I give the cashier my card, and he tells me that it is expired. \\"Can we get a manager on aisle 4 please!!\\" So the manager comes over, and the cashier pleads my case like a champ, \\"His card expired and he just wants to get the bag of cheese, he'll renew next time.\\" I would have renewed then, but, of course, my MasterCard and Visa are no good at Costco. I have the cash for the cheese, but not for the renewal as well. The manager looks at my accounts and tells me that it has been expired since May, and that he can't let me buy the cheese.

Question: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him.

Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) told the Loop Tuesday he surprised some colleagues when he told them he was the author of a new marijuana bill, but he hopes having a Republican at the helm will “make people take another look at it.” It’s not a new position for Griffith, who staked this position as Majority Leader in the Virginia legislature, and even drafted legislation in 2010 that swiftly died in the House of Delegates. Now as a member of Congress, Griffith has taken this libertarian view to a larger stage, introducing LUMMA, the Legitimate Use of Medicinal Marijuana Act. Griffith’s bill would ensure states could make their own decisions about medical marijuana usage without the federal government stepping in. His bill would also reclassify marijuana under the Justice Department’s controlled substances lists, so the drug wouldn’t be linked with harder drugs, such as heroin. “I am saying if we can use [opioids], why the fear of using [marijuana] for legit medicinal purpose?” Griffith said. Public support for medical marijuana use is overwhelming. A CNN/ORC poll in January found 88 percent of American adults supports legalizing the drug for medical reasons. Griffith still thinks legalizing marijuana fully, so just anyone can go down to “Billy Bob’s marijuana shop,” is “irresponsible,” he said. But there has also been a sea change in public opinion on legalizing marijuana for recreational use, as Colorado and Washington state did. A Pew Research Center study in February found 54 percent support making the drug legal, compared with 2010 when 41 percent supported marijuana legalization. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Republican Congressman Morgan Griffith is pushing for the legalization of medical marijuana through the Legitimate Use of Medicinal Marijuana Act (LUMMA).

Iris is returning to Britain to marry a \\"blue-blooded cheque chaser\\", but an avalanche has blocked the railway line. The stranded passengers are forced to stay the night at the inn, including Charters and Caldicott, cricket enthusiasts who want to return to England to see the last days of the Test match. That evening, Iris complains about loud folk music coming from the room above her. She has the guilty musician, Gilbert Redman (Michael Redgrave), thrown out of his room, only to have him move into hers, forcing her to capitulate. Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty), a former governess and music teacher, listens to a tune performed by a folk singer under her window. Unseen by her, the singer is killed. The next morning, before catching the train, Iris is hit on the head by a planter apparently aimed at Miss Froy, who then helps Iris onto the train. Also on board are Charters and Caldicott, Gilbert, a lawyer named Todhunter and his mistress \\"Mrs. Todhunter\\". As a result of her injury, Iris blacks out. After the train is moving, Iris wakes up in a compartment with Miss Froy and several strangers. She joins Miss Froy in the dining car for tea. Unable to be heard above the train noise, the elderly lady writes her name on the window with her finger. Soon after, they return to their compartment, where Iris falls asleep. When Iris awakens, Miss Froy has vanished. The strangers in her compartment say they know nothing about an English lady. Even Todhunter in the next compartment, who spoke with Miss Froy earlier, pretends not to remember her. Iris searches, but cannot find her. She meets up with Gilbert, who agrees to help.

I read this background article the other day: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

The town's inhabitants open it and release a deadly microorganism, which is later codenamed Andromeda by the Army. A team is sent from the Army's bio-defense department to retrieve the satellite, only to die from the disease themselves. The video footage recorded by the retrieval team and their strange deaths capture the attention of General George Mancheck, the head of the bio-defense department, who activates \\"Wildfire,\\" a team of five scientists who are called upon when high-level bioterror threats occur in the United States. The team, headed by its creator, Dr. Jeremy Stone, investigates Piedmont. They retrieve the satellite and rescue a hysterical 60-year-old man and a colicky baby who have survived the Andromeda outbreak. In an isolated underground laboratory, the Wildfire team begins their examination of the downed satellite and the two survivors. The laboratory is powered by a small water-cooled nuclear reactor. In the event of a contamination breach, a 15-minute self-destruct sequence would be automatically initiated; however if the activated sequence is deemed unnecessary, Major Bill Keane, designated by the Odd-Man Hypothesis (which states that unmarried men are capable of carrying out the best, most dispassionate decisions during crisis), is the only person able to deactivate the sequence, using his pass key and right thumbprint.

Let's do that: -60*i - 178*i + 86*i - 521*i = (-60 - 178 + 86 - 521) * i When we calculate the numbers in the parentheses, we get: (-238 - 435) * i = -673 * i Now our equation looks like this: -15479 = -673 * i Now, we need to find out what i is. It's like sharing candies equally among friends. So, we will divide -15479 by -673. i = -15479 / -673 When we do this division, we get: i = 23 So there you have it! The answer is i = 23."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"A terror suspect arrested near the Houses of Parliament is Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali, the BBC understands.\\"","completion":"Title: Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali: A Terror Suspect Arrested Near the Houses of Parliament Introduction The significance of securing national landmarks and government institutions cannot be overstated, especially in times when the threat of terrorism looms large. The case of Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali serves as a stark reminder of the importance of relentless vigilance in protecting public spaces. In this article, we delve into the background of Ali, his arrest near the Houses of Parliament, and the potential repercussions of this incident. Background of Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali is a British citizen, born in London to Somali parents. It is believed that Ali had displayed radical tendencies since a young age, and was reportedly inspired by extremist ideologies. Intelligence agencies had been keeping a watchful eye on him, following his visits to the Middle East and his suspected links to terror groups. His Arrest The arrest of Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali occurred on April 27, 2017, near the Houses of Parliament in London. The 27-year-old suspect was detained by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command on suspicion of possessing weapons and planning to carry out a terrorist attack. Ali was carrying a backpack containing multiple knives, raising immediate concerns among law enforcement authorities. Subsequently, during the course of investigation and interrogation, it was revealed that Ali had a history of involvement with extremist groups and had previously travelled to war-torn countries. He was also charged with preparing terrorist acts, and for his involvement in explosives manufacturing in Afghanistan between 2011 and 2012. Impact and Preventive Measures The arrest of Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali demonstrated the gravity of the situation in the United Kingdom, and the persistent threat of terrorism against vital institutions. The Houses of Parliament, an emblem of the British democracy and identity, symbolizes the heart of the nation's political and legislative system. This incident increased the pressure on law enforcement and intelligence agencies to ramp up vigilance, improve counterterrorism measures, and step-up security around sensitive locations. In the aftermath of Ali's arrest, and other high-profile terror attacks in the country, the British government implemented a series of security measures aimed at enhancing the protection of critical infrastructure and crowded public spaces. These measures included: 1. Enhanced surveillance and broader intelligence gathering to identify and track potential terrorists – Special attention was given to monitoring individuals with known extremist views, international travel patterns, and potential ties to terror groups. 2. Strengthening the cooperation and coordination among law enforcement, intelligence agencies and allied nations – By exchanging real-time information and sharing critical intelligence, authorities are able to better anticipate and prevent potential terror attacks. 3. Beefing up security around public spaces and iconic landmarks – The introduction of additional police forces, barricades, and sophisticated surveillance equipment are designed to mitigate the risk of an attack and provide an added sense of security for citizens. 4. Public awareness campaigns – Governments around the world are increasingly calling on the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities. Encouraging an active citizenry can be a crucial asset in the fight against terrorism. Conclusion The arrest of Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali near the Houses of Parliament served as a wake-up call on the continuous threat of terrorism facing the United Kingdom and the world. As we strive to eliminate the scourge of terrorism, the need for robust, effective, and adaptive security measures is becoming all the more pertinent. It is not only the prerogative of governments and security agencies but also the responsibility of each citizen to contribute to efforts aimed at maintaining a safe and secure society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Draft National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for England recommend teachers demonstrate how to use soap and water correctly. And they should provide age-appropriate lessons on when antibiotic drugs are unnecessary, says NICE. For example, having a cold or the flu is not a reason to seek antibiotics. These infections are viral and cannot be treated with antibiotics, says NICE. NICE says an effective hand-washing technique involves three stages: preparation, washing and rinsing, and drying. Children, and adults for that matter, should always wash their hands after using the toilet, before eating, before touching the eyes or mouth, and after handling animals. The guidelines are a response to fears that unless action is taken, treatment resistant bacteria could kill more people than currently die from cancer by 2050. Last month, Nice published guidance aimed at health professionals, estimating that as many as 10 million prescriptions for antibiotics in England are being given out unnecessarily every year.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? One of the first elements of the universe you should focus on is the scope of the universe, or how much physical space the universe takes up in a larger world. Consider how big you want your universe to be. It might help to think about what you want your fictional universe to hold and how large it is compared to other universes or worlds. Maybe the universe is the larger world, as far as your characters know, and there are several planets or lands within the universe. Or maybe the universe is very small and consists of only one planet or one land, which is then populated with many different cities and towns. Thinking about the scope of the universe can help give you a sense of the big picture. You can then zoom in to the smaller details once you have the larger details set. You should also think about how the universe looks in terms of geography and landscape. Are there many different terrains within the universe, depending on where you are in the universe? Is there one dominate terrain, such as a universe made of ice or a universe made of jungles? You should also consider how many different terrains or landscapes are going to be in the universe. You may separate these terrains by area, province, or even by different planets. You may also start to think about how the landscapes in the universe might affect other elements, such as the economic systems, the social structures, and the customs of the world. You may have certain beings who live in specific terrains or landscapes only, such as humans who live in cities and towns, and mutants who live in jungles. You should also consider how weather functions in the universe. Is there always rain and monsoons on certain planets in the universe or droughts and wildfires in certain areas on a planet or land within the universe? Try to be specific about how the weather functions in each area of the universe. Keep in mind you are building a fictional universe, so the laws of physics and nature may not function in the same ways they do on earth or in our world. You are not bound by the rules of our world and you can make your fictional universe as strange and upside down as you would like. This means you may have areas of landscape where it rains fire or where there are jungles next to ice caves and waterfalls in deserts. of the universe. To get a better sense of the physicality of the universe, you may sit down and draw a map of the universe. This could be a detailed sketch of the different lands and areas in the universe as well as the names of these areas. You can also use a computer program to draw the map. Using a computer program might allow you to get more detailed and draw elements of the universe in proportion to each other. Try to be as detailed as you can when you draw the map, as you will be using the map as a reference point when you sit down to create stories in your fictional universe. Include names of cities, towns, areas, and lands, as well as basic information about the landscape, terrain, and climate of the area. You may also color the map so it is easy to reference when you create stories set in the universe. You can view several examples of drawn maps of fictional worlds and universes, including an interactive map of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth from The Lord of the Rings.

There are the drought--avoiders--those which persist only as seeds, ready to spring up when it rains, to flower quickly and produce another crop of seeds, and to die again. There are also the drought--resisters--those which have evolved various methods for strong water, locating underground water, or reducing their need for water by such devices as shedding their leaves. The drought--resisters are perennials ,they manage to live from one rainy season to another, slowly growing bigger and bigger. Of these, the succulents is a small but interesting fraction . They may store water in their leaves, in their stems, or in underground containers. In the American deserts the best--known succulents are the cacti . They come in a wide range of sizes, from 50--foot tall giant saguaros to tiny round cacti about the size of a thumb--nail. They take thick, cylindrical or even spherical forms, thereby exposing a minimum of evaporating surface to the air and light. They are leafless, except in youth, and then the leaves are small. Typically their surfaces are spiny, discouraging thirsty animals, and channeled like an accordion , so the fleshy stem may expand quickly when the plant drinks and contract slowly as it uses up the water. The root system is widespread and shallow, with good reason; only about 3 per cent of the rain that falls on the desert penetrates to any significant depth into soil.

(-815 + 163) * g = -652 * g So the equation becomes: -652*g - 3427 = -9295 Step 2: Add 3427 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing the variable g on the left side. -652*g - 3427 + 3427 = -9295 + 3427 The equation becomes: -652*g = -5868 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of g, which is -652. (-652*g) / -652 = -5868 / -652 The equation becomes: g = 9 The solution to the equation -815*g + 163*g - 3427 = -9295 is g = 9."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the context provided, the pronoun \\"She\\" is being used to refer back to Susan, who was mentioned earlier in the sentence. This is an example of a pronoun acting as an anaphoric reference, where it points to a previously mentioned noun within the same sentence or discourse. In the sentence, \\"Jane knocked on Susan's door, but there was no answer. *She* was out,\\" the mention of Susan's door provides the connection between Susan and the subsequent \\"She.\\" When reading the sentence, our understanding of the context and the use of the pronoun lets us naturally assume that \\"She\\" is referring to Susan, since Susan is the only female character mentioned in the sentence. Furthermore, since Jane is the one knocking on the door, the pronoun \\"She\\" cannot be referring to Jane because the action that follows (\\"was out\\") is not related to Jane's action of knocking. Therefore, it makes logical sense that \\"She\\" is referring to Susan in this situation, as it is implied that she is not home.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. You know that friction also causes heat. Think about when you rub your hands together. It is friction that makes them warm. But why does this happen? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction. Water, like oil, can reduce friction. The wet surface may allow your shoes to slide more easily.

We have the equation: 3*w - 4560 = 113*w + 80*w First, let's combine the w's on the right side of the equation: 113*w + 80*w = (113+80)*w = 193*w Now our equation looks like this: 3*w - 4560 = 193*w Next, let's move the 3*w to the right side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3*w from both sides: -4560 = 193*w - 3*w Now, we have: -4560 = 190*w To find the value of w, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 190: -4560 ÷ 190 = w Now let's find the answer: w = -24 So, the solution for the equation is: w = -24"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Run Run Shaw might not be a household name, but these are: Chow Yun-fat and John Woo, who got their starts at his studio, and Quentin Tarantino, who was one of many filmmakers inspired by him. Shaw, the Hong Kong producer who is considered the father of the kung fu movie genre, died today at home in Hong Kong, aged 106. Shaw was born Shao Yifu; \\"Run Run\\" was a nickname. He and his older brother, the similarly-nicknamed Run Me, made their first film in 1924. By 1927, they had moved to Singapore and were producing movies as well as importing others to play in their theaters, the New York Times reports. After World War II, Run Run ended up in Hong Kong, where, by the late 1960s, he was enjoying great success making modern martial arts movies including Five Fingers of Death and Shaolin Avenger. The Shaw Bros. studio was the largest in Asia at that time, and produced the region's most popular films, the Los Angeles Times reports. \\"We were like the Hollywood of the 1930s,\\" Shaw once said; he had created Shaw Movietown, a huge complex where his employees both lived and worked. \\"We controlled everything: the talent, the production, the distribution and the exhibition.\\" But he lost out on one very big name: Bruce Lee. Lee wanted 10,000 per movie and a long-term contract, which Shaw rejected; a competing company, founded by a former Shaw employee, ended up backing Lee instead. But Shaw's success continued: In addition to the nearly 1,000 films his companies released, he eventually expanded into television, publishing, real estate, and more—he became one of Macy's biggest shareholders in the 1990s, to help save it from bankruptcy—and even co-produced US movies including Blade Runner. He was also a generous philanthropist who was eventually knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He is survived by his second wife and four children, the AP reports. Article:","completion":"Title: Remembering Run Run Shaw: The Father of Kung Fu Cinema Run Run Shaw may not be a name that is instantly recognizable like Chow Yun-fat, John Woo, or Quentin Tarantino, but his influence on the world of cinema, particularly in the kung fu genre, can be felt even today. Shaw, who was born Shao Yifu and affectionately nicknamed \\"Run Run,\\" passed away at 106 years old in his home in Hong Kong, leaving behind a legacy of martial arts films that have inspired generations of filmmakers. Starting with his older brother (also nicknamed Run Me), Run Run Shaw began making films in 1924. Within three years, the brothers had moved to Singapore, both producing and importing movies to be shown in their theaters. It was after World War II that Run Run found his greatest success in Hong Kong. By the late 1960s, he had become a significant figure in modern martial arts cinema, producing films such as \\"Five Fingers of Death\\" and \\"Shaolin Avenger.\\" The Shaw Bros. studio, which he established, grew to become the largest in Asia during its peak, producing the region's most popular films. Shaw once compared his studio to the Hollywood of the 1930s; he created Shaw Movietown, an expansive complex where employees resided and worked. He explained, \\"We controlled everything: the talent, the production, the distribution, and the exhibition.\\" However, this control did not extend to the legendary Bruce Lee, as Shaw had missed out on the opportunity to work with him. Lee demanded a 10,000 salary per movie and a long-term contract, which Shaw did not accept. Eventually, a former Shaw employee formed a competing company that signed Lee, leaving Shaw's studio without the iconic martial artist. Undeterred by this loss, Shaw went on to achieve continued success in the entertainment industry. His companies released nearly 1,000 films, expanded into television, publishing, real estate, and even co-produced US movies, including the iconic science fiction film \\"Blade Runner.\\" Furthermore, Shaw ventured into retail, becoming one of Macy's largest shareholders in the 1990s. Besides being an influential figure in the film industry, Run Run Shaw was also a philanthropist.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"If the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is not true. The two sentences present contradictory information regarding the British government's response to Mahatma Gandhi's civil disobedience movement and his activities during that time. In the first sentence, it is stated that the British, concerned about the growing influence of Gandhi's civil disobedience movement, arrested and imprisoned him in 1922 for a period of two years. This indicates that the British felt threatened by his actions and sought to curtail his impact on the Indian population by taking him out of the public sphere through imprisonment. In stark contrast, the second sentence claims that the British allowed Gandhi to engage in his activities freely, including the organization and expansion of his movement. This statement suggests that the British took a passive or even supportive approach towards Gandhi and his initiatives, which is in direct conflict with the information provided in the first sentence.

Answer: The 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s helped make Nashville the center of the country music recording industry. Question: how tennessee became a state Answer:","completion":"Tennessee becoming a state was a lengthy and intricate process that began long before 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol or the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s. Understanding the historical context and key events that led to Tennessee's statehood is essential to fully appreciate how it became the 16th state of the United States. In the mid-18th century, Tennessee was mainly inhabited by various Native American tribes, primarily the Cherokee. European settlers, mainly from the British colonies, moved into the area in search of fertile lands. Initially, these settlers faced strong opposition and resistance from the native tribes, but eventually, they started establishing small frontier settlements. By the 1760s, the region had become a part of the British Province of North Carolina. The 1770s saw a series of developments that further shifted the geopolitical landscape in Tennessee. The Transylvania Purchase in 1775 led to an increase in the number of settlers and territorial disputes among the British, the native tribes, and colonial pioneers. Throughout the 1780s, the area that now encompasses Tennessee gained more autonomy but was still part of North Carolina. In 1784, the residents of the region east of the Appalachian Mountains, known as the Watauga Association, attempted to secede from North Carolina and form a separate state called \\"Franklin.\\" However, this proposal to create the State of Franklin was not approved by the Continental Congress, and the movement ultimately failed. After the signing of the United States Constitution in 1787, the Southwest Territory was established. This territory included the area west of the Appalachian Mountains, which comprises modern-day Tennessee. President George Washington appointed William Blount, a native of North Carolina, as the governor of the Southwest Territory in 1790. Governor Blount worked closely with the settlers and native tribes, helping to establish a peaceful relationship between them. He oversaw the treaty negotiations that led to the Treaty of Holston (White's Fort) in 1791, which established formal borders between the Cherokee Nation and the Southwest Territory. With the borders in place, the population in the territory grew significantly, reaching a level appropriate to pursue statehood. In the summer of 1795, Governor Blount called for a constitutional convention and tasked delegates to draft a state constitution. The convention produced the Tennessee Constitution, which included provisions like popularly elected governors, a bicameral legislature, and a bill of rights. With the new constitution in place, Tennessee's statehood proposal was sent to Congress. On June 1, 1796, the United States Congress admitted Tennessee into the Union as the 16th state. This marked the first instance of a new state being admitted under the process outlined in the U.S. Constitution. In conclusion, Tennessee's journey to becoming a state involved various factors like European settlement, territorial conflicts, governance under the Southwest Territory, and negotiation of treaties with native tribes. The process culminated with the drafting of the Tennessee Constitution and its admission to the Union on June 1, 1796. The development and growth of country music and the influence of the Grand Ole Opry, which came much later, would significantly contribute to the cultural identity of the state, but was not related to its admission as a state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"The value of any material object in this world can be assessed, but not the value of love.\\" said in Russian?","completion":"«Ценность любого материального объекта в этом мире может быть оценена, но не ценность любви» - this is how you can say \\"The value of any material object in this world can be assessed, but not the value of love\\" in Russian. Now, let me provide you with a detailed explanation and breakdown of this translation: 1. Ценность (Tsen-nost') - This word translates to \\"value\\" or \\"worth\\" in English. It is a noun and refers to the quality that makes something desirable, useful, or important. 2. любого (lyu-bo-go) - This is the Genitive case of the adjective \\"любой\\" (lyu-boy), which translates to \\"any\\" or \\"every\\" in English. It is used here to emphasize the indefinite nature of the material objects being referred to. 3. материального (ma-te-rial-no-go) - This is the Genitive case of the adjective \\"материальный\\" (ma-te-rial-ny), which means \\"material\\" or \\"tangible.\\" In the sentence, it is used to describe the type of objects that the speaker is talking about. 4. объекта (ob-ye-k-ta) - This is the Genitive case of the noun \\"объект\\" (ob-yekt), which translates to \\"object\\" or \\"item\\" in English. It is used here to refer to the material things whose value can be assessed. 5. в (v) - This simple preposition translates to \\"in\\" or \\"at\\" in English. It is used here to express the location of the objects mentioned. 6. этом (e-tom) - This is the Locative case of the pronoun \\"этот\\" (e-tot), which means \\"this\\" in English. It is used here to refer to the world being spoken about. 7. мире (mi-re) - This is the Locative case of the noun \\"мир\\" (mir), which translates to \\"world\\" or \\"earth\\" in English. It is used here as the location where the material objects are found. 8. может (mo-zhet) - This word is the 3rd person singular form of the verb \\"мочь\\" (moch), which means \\"can\\" or \\"be able to\\" in English. It is used here to express the possibility of assessing the value of the objects mentioned. 9. быть (byt') - This is the infinitive form of the auxiliary verb \\"быть\\" (byt'), which means \\"to be\\" in English. It is used here in conjunction with the main verb \\"мочь\\" (moch) to express possibility or capability. 10. оценена (o-tse-ne-na) - This word is the feminine passive participle form of the verb \\"оценить\\" (o-tse-nit'), which translates to \\"assess\\" or \\"evaluate\\" in English. It is used here to indicate the action of determining the value of the material objects. 11. но (no) - This is a simple conjunction that means \\"but\\" or \\"however\\" in English. It is used here to express the contrast between the value of material objects and the value of love. 12. не (ne) - This is a common negative particle that translates to \\"not\\" in English. It is used here to negate the possibility of assessing the value of love. 13. ценность (Tsen-nost') - This word, as mentioned before, translates to \\"value\\" or \\"worth\\" in English. It is repeated in the sentence to draw a parallel between the value of material objects and the value of love. 14. любви (lyub-vi) - This is the Genitive case of the noun \\"любовь\\" (lyu-bov'), which translates to \\"love\\" in English. It is used here as the object of the preposition \\"of\\" in the phrase \\"the value of love.\\" So, putting it all together, the translation of \\"The value of any material object in this world can be assessed, but not the value of love\\" in Russian is: «Ценность любого материального объекта в этом мире может быть оценена, но не ценность любви»."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (\\"Le Bon Marché\\" in 1852) and in New York (with Stewart's). - Butchered From Inside ( BFI ) is an electronic magazine edited by the Italian hacker community ( most notably , the S0ftpj group ) . It has been published , albeit irregularly , for over 10 years . It has also published various paper editions , such as the one for MOCA , the 10 - year summer camp for the organization \`\` Metro Olografix '' , the oldest Italian hacker 's association ( similar in inception to the German CCC ) . The editing criteria of originality and the peer review process are very similar to the ones adopted by Phrack magazine ( which mentions BFI as \`\` nice mag '' ) . While all the published issues are in the Italian language , French and English translations of a few articles are available . An archive of tools produced by contributors is also available . Some well known , published software such as KSTAT ( Kernel Security Therapy Anti-Trolls ) have been published and developed on and for BFI . This , and other content published on BFI , has been cited in at least 4 books , as well as on VX Heavens , and in mixed other archives . The BFI staff has been interviewed a number of times by in - print media ( such as \`\` ICT Security '' , the only Italian printed magazine on the subject ) , as well as Internet media . - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. - A gunpowder magazine, also known as a polverista, is a magazine (building) designed to store the explosive gunpowder in wooden barrels for safety. Gunpowder, until superseded, was a universal explosive used in the military and for civil engineering: both applications required storage magazines. Most magazines were purely functional and tended to be in remote and secure locations. - An online magazine is a magazine published on the Internet, through bulletin board systems and other forms of public computer networks. One of the first magazines to convert from a print magazine format to being online only was the computer magazine Datamation. - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\".

Article: Let's face it.No one drinks die t soda for the taste.People drink diet soda in the hope that it will help them lose weight or at least keep them from gaining it.Yet it seems to have exactly the opposite effect, according to a new study. Researchers from the University of Texas said those who drank two or more diet sodas a day had waist size increases that were six times greater than those of people who didn't drink diet soda.\\"What we saw was that the more diet sodas a person drank, the more weight they were likely to gain,\\" said Sharon Fowler. The study was based on data from 474 participants in a large, ongoing research project, where the participants were followed for nearly l0 years. While the findings are surprising, they also offer some explanations. Nutrition expert, Melanie Rogers, who works with overweight patients in New York, has found that when patients are switched from regular to diet soda, they don't lose weight at all.\\"We weren't seeing weight loss necessarily, and that was confusing to us,\\" said Rogers. So why would diet soda cause weight gain? No one knows for sure yet, but it could be that people think they can eat more if they drink diet soda, and so over-compensate for the missing calories( ). A related study found some sweeteners raised blood sugar levels in some mice.\\" Data from this and other potential studies suggest that the promotion of diet sodas and artificial sweeteners may be risky,\\" said study researcher Helen P.Hazuda, professor at the University of Texas's school of medicine. Theymay be free of calories, but not of consequences. Question: The new study suggests that drinking diet soda _ . Options: A: helps people to be healthier B: causes people to become heavier C: offers people more calories D: makes people much thinner Answer:","completion":"B: causes people to become heavier"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 2: People who are distracted are hazards. Given the two facts above, what is something that can be hazardous to use in public? A:","completion":"Given the two facts you've mentioned, using cell phones in public can be hazardous. This is primarily due to the potential distraction they can cause. For instance, people may be so focused on their phones that they neglect to pay attention to their surroundings. This can lead to various accidents, like bumping into other people, or even dangerous situations such as walking into traffic or missing warning signs of danger. In addition, being distracted by cell phones can also make individuals more vulnerable to theft or other types of crime, as they may not be alert to what's happening around them. However, it's important to clarify that it is not the cell phone itself that's hazardous, but the distraction it can cause when people fail to use their phones responsibly or mindfully. So, using smartphones or any other devices in public isn't inherently dangerous; it becomes hazardous when users become oblivious to their surroundings due to being overly engrossed in their screens."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Place the screw: Put the screw into the hole, and make sure it's straight and lined up with the hole. 5. Turn the screwdriver: Hold the screwdriver or power drill and turn it clockwise. Keep turning until the screw is tight and secure in the material. 6. Be cautious: Don't turn the screw too hard or for too long, or it could damage the material or the screw head.

Step 1: Combine like terms The left side of the equation has the terms b and -5*b. Combine these terms to condense the equation: b - 5*b = -4*b (because 1b - 5b = -4b) So, the simplified equation is: -4*b = b Step 2: Move 'b' term to the right side of the equation To isolate 'b' on one side of the equation, we need to add 4*b to both sides, effectively moving the term to the right side: -4*b + 4*b = b + 4*b This simplifies to: 0 = 5*b Step 3: Solve for 'b' Now that we have 5*b on one side of the equation and 0 on the other side, we can solve for 'b' by dividing both sides of the equation by 5: 0/5 = 5*b/5 This simplifies to: 0 = b So, in the equation b - 5*b = b, the value of b is 0."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(WHDH) - The Donahue family learned of ‘Whitey’ Bulger’s prison murder through text messages Tuesday morning. And Tommy Donahue, whose father, Michael, was among the 11 murder victims linked to the notorious South Boston mob moss, said his immediate reaction was elation. “I grew up going to Catholic school,” Tommy Donahue said. “It just brings me a lot of joy knowing that for the rest of his life, he’ll be getting a pitchfork in his (expletive) from the devil himself to eternity.” The Donahues are somewhat relieved to put this chapter of their lives behind them. “Thirty-something years of him putting my family in distraught, finally it’s all over,” Donahue said. “We weren’t ever going to be able to move on until he was dead.” Tommy and his mother Pat attended nearly every court appearance Bulger made and when the crime boss was convicted for killing Donahue’s dad, Tommy said he hoped the next time he saw Bulger was on his deathbed. “I said ‘next time I’m going to talk to the media will be when he’s dead,'” Donahue said. “Very true. Here I am, a happier man.” Tommy’s mother, Pat, also expressed relief following the 89-year-old’s death. “I want to open a champagne bottle and pop that cork. That’s how I feel,” Pat Donahue said. “Whitey Bulger meant nothing to me.” The Donahues said that while they wanted Bulger to sit in prison for all of his crimes, especially the murders, getting killed in prison wasn’t the easy way out. “He died the way he lived,” Pat Donahue said. “He killed people and he was killed.” Pat Donahue is working on a documentary about Bulger’s trial.

Victim's Fam Says Justice was Served Whitey Bulger Killers Tried to Remove His Tongue, Victim's Fam Thinks Justice was Done Exclusive Details Whitey Bulger was targeted for a mob hit and the killers did what mob killers do with so-called \\"rats\\" -- they try to cut out their tongue and gouge their eyes out. Sources at the USP Hazelton prison in West Virginia tell TMZ, Bulger was killed in his cell at around 6 AM Tuesday, NOT in a common area as first reported. We're told 4 inmates walked into the cell where Whitey was sitting in his wheelchair. They brutally beat him with a lock in a sock and used a shiv to try and gouge his eyes out. They also attempted to cut out his tongue. We're told there was a lot of blood in Bulger's mouth but we don't know if the tongue was actually removed. We're told surveillance cameras captured the 4 inmates walking into Bulger's cell and walking out with their clothes clearly bloodied. The attack was not caught on video. We're told the killers went back to their cells, changed out of their bloody clothes and then walked back to Bulger's cell with a mop and a bucket to clean up the mess. As for the motive ... our prison sources say prison officials believe it was mob retaliation because Bulger was considered a rat and an informant who helped put away several members of the mob. The officials believe the mob put out a hit on Bulger and removal of the eyes and tongue are signs of such a hit. BTW ... Patricia Donahue -- the widow of Michael Donahue whom Bulger killed in 1982 -- reacted to the news by saying justice was served. She also told us how she plans to celebrate. Her son, Tommy, agreed, saying how Bulger's death brought some much-needed relief.

Officials with the Federal Bureau of Prisons said Bulger died Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2018, in a West Virginia prison after being sentenced in 2013 in Boston to spend the rest... (Associated Press) BOSTON (AP) — A Mafia hit man who is said to hate \\"rats\\" is under suspicion in the slaying of former Boston crime boss and longtime FBI informant James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, who was found dead hours after he was transferred to a West Virginia prison, an ex-investigator briefed on the case said Wednesday. The former official said that Fotios \\"Freddy\\" Geas and at least one other inmate are believed to have been involved in Bulger's killing. The longtime investigator was not authorized to discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. Authorities have not disclosed the cause of death. Bulger's killing has raised questions of why he was transferred to the prison and why the 89-year-old was placed in the general population instead of special housing. He was found dead Tuesday. Geas, 51, and his brother were sentenced to life in prison in 2011 for their roles in several violent crimes, including the 2003 killing of Adolfo \\"Big Al\\" Bruno, a Genovese crime family boss who was gunned down in a Springfield, Massachusetts, parking lot. Private investigator Ted McDonough, who knew Geas, told The Boston Globe: \\"Freddy hated rats.\\" \\"Freddy hated guys who abused women. Whitey was a rat who killed women. It's probably that simple,\\" McDonough told the newspaper, which first reported that Geas was under suspicion. It was not clear whether Geas has an attorney. Several other lawyers who represented him over the years didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI spokeswoman in Pittsburgh declined to comment on Geas. Federal officials said only that they are investigating the death as a homicide. Bulger's death was the third killing in the past six months at the prison, where union officials have raised concerns about dozens of vacant jobs. Two inmates were killed in fights with other prisoners in September and April. Five members of Congress wrote to Attorney General Sessions last week about what they saw as chronic understaffing at USP Hazelton and other federal prisons. Bulger led South Boston's Irish mob for decades and became an FBI informant who supplied information on the New England Mafia, his gang's main rival, in an era when bringing down the Italian mob was a top national priority for the bureau. Tipped off that he was about to be indicted, Bulger became a fugitive and eluded authorities for 16 years before being captured in 2011. He was convicted in 2013 in 11 underworld slayings and a long list of other crimes and was sentenced to spend the rest of his life behind bars. He had just arrived Monday at USP Hazelton, a high-security prison in Bruceton Mills, West Virginia. He had previously been in a prison in Florida, with a stopover at a transfer facility in Oklahoma City. Federal Bureau of Prisons officials and his attorney declined to comment on why he was being moved. Bulger's attorney, J.W. Carney Jr., blamed his death on prison officials, saying Bulger \\"was sentenced to life in prison, but as a result of decisions by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, that sentence has been changed to the death penalty.\\" Bureau of Prison officials had no comment on Carney's remarks. The Geas brothers were not made members of the Mafia because they were Greek, not Italian. But they were close associates of the mob and acted as enforcers. ___ Associated Press reporters Eric Tucker and Mike Balsamo in Washington and John Raby in Charleston, West Virginia contributed to this report. ||||| When private investigator Ted McDonough heard that Freddy Geas was suspected by authorities of taking part in the murder of James “Whitey” Bulger, he knew immediately why Geas might have done it. “Freddy hated rats,” said McDonough, using the slang for criminal informants. McDonough had become friendly with Geas while working for him as an investigator. “Freddy hated guys who abused women. Whitey was a rat who killed women. It’s probably that simple,” McDonough said. Advertisement Fotios “Freddy” Geas — Mafia hitman, career criminal, prison lifer — did not like informants, and was almost certainly well aware of the fact that Bulger had led a charmed life for a long time as an informant for the FBI.

Sign up for more newsletters here People with knowledge of the investigation said that Bulger had requested to be housed in general population at the federal prison in Hazelton, W. Va., where he had just been transferred from a federal prison in Florida after a brief stop in Oklahoma. Geas is serving a life sentence at the prison in Hazelton for his role in the assassination of Adolfo “Big Al” Bruno, the onetime head of the Mafia in Springfield, after both the man who ordered him to kill Bruno and the hitman he dispatched to do the murder turned on him and testified against him. People familiar with the investigation suggest that Bulger was murdered by more than one of his fellow inmates, and that Geas didn’t dispute his role in the killing. RELATED: The long and deadly career of ‘Whitey’ Bulger David Hoose, the lawyer who initially represented Geas in the Mafia killings, said he was not surprised to hear that Geas didn’t dispute his role in Bulger’s killing and refused to identify a possible accomplice. Advertisement “He wouldn’t rat on anybody,” Hoose said, “and he had no respect for anyone who would.” Freddy Geas, 51, and his brother Ty, 46, were a tag team pair of criminals from West Springfield who were well known, and feared, in Western Massachusetts. They have long rap sheets and were known for their violent impulsivity. When Ty Geas was 17, he was sentenced to a year in jail for firing an assault rifle into the air during a high school hockey game. Freddy Geas exhibited what would become a lifelong, violent animosity toward those who cooperate with the authorities, eventually pleading guilty to threatening to kill a witness against his brother. Freddy Geas’s reputation for sudden, impulsive violence is long established. When a bar fight at a Springfield bar called Sh-Booms spilled onto the street in 1989, Freddy, then 22, wrecked an expensive vintage car parked outside. In 2006, he went to jail for beating a pair of men with a baseball bat at a strip club. By that time, the Geas brothers were well known to local authorities as the hired muscle for an aspiring Mafia leader named Anthony Arillotta. Because they were Greek, the Geas brothers could not be “made” members of the Mafia, but they carried the mob’s imprimatur, according to Springfield and State Police. “Nobody screwed with them,” McDonough said. “Freddy, especially.” Advertisement In 2009, Freddy Geas was charged with a series of crimes, including the hit on Al Bruno and the 2003 murder of Gary Westerman, Arillotta’s brother-in-law. He was also charged with being the getaway driver in the botched murder of Frank Dabado, a cement union boss in the Bronx. Dabado was targeted for murder after he and Artie Nigro, a Genovese crime family boss, had a fight over some Tony Bennett concert tickets. RELATED: Inmate with Mafia ties investigated in Bulger’s killing McDonough, the private investigator, said Freddy Geas was crushed to learn that the star witness against him was Arillotta, the Mafia up-and-comer who had groomed him. Arillotta’s testimony described a chaotic scene right out of a Martin Scorcese movie. After Freddy Geas shot Westerman in the head twice, the mortally wounded Westerman tried to break free from the Geas brothers as they dragged him to a grave. Arillotta testified that he and Emilio Fusco, a Mafia soldier in the Genovese crime family, finished Westerman off by beating him to death with shovels. Arillotta testified that Freddy Geas complimented the assembled murderers for good teamwork. Freddy Geas was convicted of hiring the hitman who killed Bruno, who was murdered so that Arillotta could assume control of the Mafia in Springfield. Geas met that hitman, Frankie Roche, in prison and was his friend, police said. But like so many other people who once considered themselves Freddy Geas’s friend, Roche rolled on him. In a 2007 statement to Springfield police that was obtained by the Globe, Roche admitted that he shot Bruno outside the Mount Carmel Society social club in Springfield. “Freddy had called me earlier in the day and told me that Al was definitely going to be there,” Roche told police. “I killed Al Bruno because I was paid to do it. Freddy Geas is the person who paid me to do it.” McDonough said that Geas harbored a special hatred for informants, criminals who saved their own skin by giving up others. In 2016, Taylor Geas, Freddy’s daughter, wrote a piece for The Republican newspaper of Springfield, recalling that as a child she thought her father was never around because he was in the Army. “My dad led a double life,” she said. She could not reconcile the father she knew with the criminal whose exploits were well documented in newspapers and on television. “The person I know is the father that would tuck me in at night, and tell me funny stories until I fell asleep,” she wrote. “He was the person that taught me how to throw a baseball, and got me my first pair of soccer cleats. When I look in the mirror I see his smile because I have the same one.” TIMELINE: Bulger’s crimes, escape, capture, conviction, death McDonough described Freddy Geas as extremely personable, but a committed criminal. They met regularly at the Cafe Manhattan, a bar in downtown Springfield. “A good conversationalist,” McDonough said. But McDonough was under no illusions. “He liked me because I was his private investigator. You would not want Freddy as an enemy.” McDonough speculated that if Freddy Geas killed Bulger, it would elevate him in the criminal hierarchy, especially among the Mafia, whose members and associates would have felt duty-bound to kill Bulger after they learned he had fed the FBI information about the Mafia in Boston. For those whose loved ones were murdered by Bulger, and those who hunted him down and prosecuted him, Bulger’s demise brought a sense of relief — and irony, given that the suspect in his killing was believed to have been motivated by Bulger’s informant status. They said Bulger inflicted similarly terrible ends on others, especially those he suspected of being informants. Tom Donahue, the son of one of Bulger’s victims, said he always assumed Bulger would die in prison of natural causes. He said he took comfort from knowing that Bulger experienced some of the pain that so many of his victims did. “I think it’s justice,” said Donahue, whose father, Michael, an innocent truck driver, was murdered by Bulger. Donahue said he hoped he would be able to put some money into Freddy Geas’s prison canteen account. Shelley Murphy of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Often, redness and irritation is the result of over-exfoliating or using abrasive or harsh acne reducing products. Stop using anything new you have put on your skin for at least 4 days, and consider switching to a gentler cleaning product. Acne medicines using retinoids are particularly irritating. After 4 days, try using the product sparingly to see if irritation still occurs. If so, throw it away. Do not introduce more than one product at a time to your skin, so you know which one is “too much.” A good cleanser should wash off all dirt and makeup, but not your skin’s natural oils. If your skin feels tight or squeaky after washing, the product is too harsh. Cetaphil and Eucerin are good products for sensitive skin. Hot or cold water can damage capillaries and cause redness. Hot water also dries your skin out quickly, causing redness. Look for a cleanser made for your skin type, whether it tends to be oily or dry. Foaming cleansers are generally bad for dry skin. Avoid cleansers with harsh ingredients like sodium laureth sulfate, menthol or alcohol. Avoid products with fragrances and dyes. Also avoid medicated acne cleansers, since they usually strip away good oils. You may need to use different products for different seasons, depending on how dry the air is and how you skin conditions adjust accordingly. Choose a moisturizer with glycerin as the first ingredient since it is very efficient at holding in moisture, or just use plain petroleum jelly. Use it every time you shower, after drying off. Beware of typical hand sanitizers, which contain alcohol and dry out your skin. Look for one specifically made for hydrating dry skin too. If you are experiencing widespread irritation, it may be how you wash your clothes. Try a different detergent made for sensitive skin or that has mostly natural ingredients. If the air is dry, particularly in winter months, using a humidifier can help prevent your skin from drying out while you sleep. Moisture in the air also helps to reduce inflammation. Fill your plate with anti-inflammatory foods, such as leafy greens, salmon, avocado, and walnuts. Take anti-inflammatory supplements, such as probiotics, spirulina, vitamin C, and fish oil. These nutrients will help you reduce inflammation in your skin.

The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235 284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century.

Well read on, as this month we're going to hear from overseas teens about what they do to help the environment. I can't remember when I started collecting litter . But it was when I got tired of seeing litter near my home and realized that no one else was going to pick it up. I live close to a forest in Ohio, America. I can walk there in three minutes! I used to love going there to play with my dog. But one day there was so much litter there that I became very unhappy. I decided I had to clean up the forest. I wanted to feel happy going there again. I made my first trip to clean the forest that afternoon. I took a big black rubbish bag with me. Ten minutes after starting to pick up litter, my bag was full! It had cans, bottles, broken glass and newspapers in it. Since that first trip three years ago. I've gone to the forest four times a year to pick up litter. I'm often there for three hours. It makes me feel great to do something for the environment. After each trip, I look at all the litter I've found. If any of it is recyclable , I keep it.I can't understand why people drop litter. But I will keep picking it up until they stop dropping it.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government. After reading the above, is \\"Light and heat\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Where did man get fire and what luxuries did it provide?\\"? Possible answers: [-] no [-] yes","completion":"yes \\"Light and heat\\" is the correct answer because Peking Man learned how to capture flame and keep it alight, which provided them with two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Other answers are wrong because they do not relate to the specific luxuries that fire provided for early humans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Early trauma-induced coagulopathy may increase susceptibility to nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. However, the relationship between trauma- induced coagulopathy and the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia in spinal cord injury patients has not been evaluated.', 'We conducted a 5-year retrospective study of 300 spinal cord injury patients admitted to Level 1 trauma center. Standard coagulation studies were evaluated upon arrival, prior to fluid resuscitative efforts, and at 24 u200ah after admission. Based on these studies, three groups of patients were identified: no coagulopathy, latent coagulopathy, and admission coagulopathy. Ventilator- associated pneumonia was identified utilizing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Since we used the data in the trauma registry and did not have the information on FiO2 and PEEP, we elected to use the VAP terminology and not the VAE sequence. Demographic, injury, and clinical characteristics were compared among no coagulopathy, latent coagulopathy, and admission coagulopathy groups using chi-square test and ANOVA for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. A logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between coagulopathy and both ventilator-associated pneumonia and mortality.', 'The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was 54.5% (OR 4.01, 95% CI 1.76-9.15) in spinal cord injury patients with admission coagulopathy, compared with the 17.5% in spinal cord injury patients with no coagulopathy. Mortality was significantly higher in spinal cord injury patients with admission coagulopathy than in spinal cord injury patients with no coagulopathy (OR 6.14, 95% CI 1.73-21.73).After adjusting for age, race, injury mechanism, Injury Severity Score, base deficit at admission, the number of pRBC units transfused in the first 24u200a h, and hospital stay, only the association of ventilator-associated pneumonia among those with admission coagulopathy remained significant (OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.48-8.32). Compared with those with no coagulopathy, patients with admission coagulopathy had a higher odds of death (4.10, 95% CI 1.53-11.02), though this association lost significance after adjustment (OR 3.56, 95% CI 0.90-14.12). There was no statistical difference in mortality for latent coagulopathy compared with no coagulopathy patients. Answer: Coagulopathy on admission in patients with spinal cord injury is associated with a statistically significant increase in ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence. Additional research is warranted to further characterize this association.

Daryl Franklin Hohl (born October 11, 1946), better known by his stage name Daryl Hall, is an American rock, R&B, and soul singer; keyboardist, guitarist, songwriter, and producer, best known as the co-founder and lead vocalist of Hall & Oates (with guitarist and songwriter John Oates). In the 1970s and early 1980s, Hall scored numerous Billboard chart hits and is regarded as one of the best soul singers of his generation. Guitarist Robert Fripp, who collaborated with him in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has written, \\"Daryl's pipes were a wonder. I have never worked with a more able singer.\\" Hall was born in Pottstown, a Pennsylvania borough 40 miles (64 km) from Philadelphia. His parents each had a background in music: his father was a professional singer and his mother was a vocal coach. He is of German descent. He started recording while still a student at Owen J. Roberts High School, from which he graduated in 1965. In college at Temple University in Philadelphia, he majored in music, while continuing to record, working with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff as both an artist and a session musician. During his first semester at Temple, in the fall of 1965, he and four other white Temple University students formed the vocal harmony group the Temptones. They were popular additions to the largely black Philly soul scene, defeating both The Ambassadors and The Delfonics in a contest at the Uptown Theater. The Temptones recorded a handful of singles for Arctic Records, produced by Jimmy Bishop. While performing at the Uptown theatre, Hall formed creative affiliations with such artists as Smokey Robinson, The Temptations, and many other top soul singers of the 1960s. In 1967 Hall met John Oates, who was also an undergraduate at Temple University. According to Daryl Hall, they met when \\"We got in the middle of a fight at a dance - I have no idea what the fight was about. I guess the Greek letters on one gang's jackets didn't appeal to the other gang. We both beat it out the back and met on the elevator while leaving the place rather quickly.\\" Hall was by then a senior, while Oates was a freshman. They played together until Oates transferred to a different school at age 19. Hall did not let Oates' departure discourage him from pursuing his own musical career: he dropped out of college in 1968 and worked with Tim Moore in a short-lived rock band, Gulliver, and released an album on the Elektra Records label. In 1969 Hall again began recording songs by other artists, which led to the duo signing their first record contract in early 1972.

Kay, dressed in finery that looks like they spent most of their inheritance on her outfit, Barbara, as Miss Sears, Kays secretary and Aunt Sue, as Kays maid, arrive at their bungalow. They sing and dance their version of Oh Me, Oh Mi-ami. Jack, one of the resorts waiters, delivers champagne compliments of Mr. Jeffrey Bolton. During Jacks visit to their bungalow, he flirts with Aunt Sue. He also agrees to help Kay discern the difference between male fortune hunters and actual millionaires. Kay telephones Mr. Bolton to thank him for the champagne, but complains about its flatness. When Jeffrey comes over to check out the problem, he is so impressed with Kay that he invites her to a party at his suite, where most of the guests are asleep (the party has been going for days). Once the band leaves after having played for sixteen hours, Jeff plays the piano and sings You Started Something. Another band arrives and joins in as Kay sings. After a short duet by Jeff and Kay, she performs a cute seated tap routine with the Condos Brothers. Kay meets Phil, apparently another wealthy playboy, at the party.

Write a summary based on this article: Over the dissents of three Justices, the Supreme Court on Tuesday evening barred Texas from enforcing two parts of its new abortion-restriction law — one part as it applied throughout the state, the other as it applied to two clinics in the southwest part of the state. The state may not now enforce a requirement that all clinics in the state upgrade their facilities to be hospital-like surgical centers, even when they perform abortions only through the use of drugs, not surgery. And it may not enforce, against the clinics in McAllen and El Paso, a requirement that all doctors performing abortions have privileges to admit patients to a hospital within thirty miles of the clinic. That requirement can continue to be enforced elsewhere in Texas, the Court indicated. Those two provisions, together, had reduced the number of clinics still operating in the state to seven, with an eighth soon to open. At one time recently, Texas had forty-one clinics. The Supreme Court’s action Tuesday will allow the reopening of thirteen closed clinics on Wednesday, lawyers for the clinics said. The Court’s order will remain in effect while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rules on a constitutional challenge to the two measures. That court had previously upheld the admitting privileges requirement as it applied all across the state. Most recently, it had blocked a new ruling by a judge in Austin that seemed to invalidate the two provisions statewide. The Supreme Court gave no explanation for the four-sentence order. It noted that Justices Samuel A. Alito, Jr., Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas would have refused to delay any part of the state requirements. They did not give their reasoning. It would have taken the votes of five Justices to block the provisions, so it appears that at least that number from among the other six Justices voted for the result. The Justices voting for the order were not noted. In asking the Court to set aside, temporarily, the Fifth Circuit’s orders permitting enforcement of the two provisions, lawyers for the clinics had said that clinics closed as a result probably would not reopen unless those restrictions were lifted. They also contended that there had recently been an increase in the number of women seeking illegal abortions in areas where clinics could no longer provide services. The seven clinics that were not affected by the new restrictions (and the eighth that is soon to open) were concentrated in the four largest metropolitan areas in the eastern part of the state. The lawyers had told the Court that, for the time being, there were no licensed facilities to provide abortions anywhere in the state south or west of San Antonio — “an area larger than most states.” Texas officials had urged the Supreme Court not to block the new measures, arguing that they were necessary to protect the health of pregnant women in the state. They also argued that the challengers had exaggerated the practical impact of the new restrictions, and that most women would continue to have access to abortions within what they said was a reasonable driving distance. The Fifth Circuit, in allowing the restrictions to go into or remain in effect, had found that they would not impose an “undue burden” on a significant fraction of the women in the state who would need abortion services. The Supreme Court’s order is not a final ruling on the constitutionality of the new limitations, but is a strong indication that the state may have difficulty defending them, at least as statewide measures. The Court’s order marked the first time in the Justices’ new Term that the abortion controversy had returned. There may be other tests of the Court’s current view on that controversy later in the Term. Recommended Citation: Lyle Denniston, Court blocks abortion limits in Texas, SCOTUSblog (Oct. 14, 2014, 7:08 PM), http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/10/court-blocks-abortion-limits-in-texas/ ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked key parts of a 2013 law in Texas that had closed all but eight facilities providing abortions in America's second most-populous state. In an unsigned order, the justices sided with abortion rights advocates and health care providers in suspending an Oct. 2 ruling by a panel of the New Orleans-based U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that Texas could immediately apply a rule making abortion clinics statewide spend millions of dollars on hospital-level upgrades. The court also put on hold a separate provision of the law only as it applies to clinics in McAllen and El Paso that requires doctors at the facilities to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The admitting privileges remains in effect elsewhere in Texas. Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas said they would have ruled against the clinics in all respects. The 5th Circuit is still considering the overall constitutionality of the sweeping measure overwhelmingly passed by the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry last year. But even as it weighs the merits of the law, the appeals court said that it can be enforced in the meantime — opening the door for the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. The 5th Circuit decision had blocked an August ruling by Austin-based U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel, who had found that requiring hospital-style upgrades was less about safety than making access to abortion difficult. Yeakel's ruling temporarily suspended the upgrade rules before they could go into effect Sept. 1 — and the order from the Supreme Court means they are on hold again. Allowing the rules on hospital-level upgrades to be enforced — including mandatory operating rooms and air filtration systems — shuttered more than a dozen clinics across Texas. Until the nation's highest court intervened, only abortion facilities in the Houston, Austin, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth areas remained open. And none was left along the Texas-Mexico border or outside any of the state's largest urban areas. Some other clinics, meanwhile, had closed even earlier amid enforcement of the rule on admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. That portion has already been upheld twice by the appeals court. The fight over the Texas law is the latest over tough new abortion restrictions that have been enacted across the country. The office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican who is the favorite in next month's governor's race, is leading the defense of the law. Critics call the measure a backdoor effort to outlaw abortions. Attorneys for the state have denied that Texas women would be burdened by fewer abortion facilities, saying nearly 9 in 10 would still live within 150 miles of a provider. The law's opponents, however, note that still leaves nearly a million Texas women embarking on drives longer than three hours to get an abortion. Democrat Wendy Davis launched her campaign for governor behind the celebrity she achieved through a nearly 13-hour filibuster last summer that temporarily blocked the law in the state Senate. ___ Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report from Austin, Texas. |||||","completion":"The Supreme Court has barred Texas from enforcing two parts of its new abortion-restriction law, allowing 13 clinics to reopen.

This week, Major League Baseball announced it would no longer allow the use of chewing tobacco when fans are present. If you've got it, says the league, you've got to conceal it. Since baseball became a professional sport in the mid-19th century, players and coaches have been tucking tobacco between their gums and cheeks and spitting out brown saliva. It's a ritual that has permeated the game. Atlanta Braves coach Bobby Dews remembers the first time he was offered a \\"chaw\\" of tobacco, as they call it.

TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The ordeal of Gulnaz did not simply begin and end with the physical attack of her rape. The rape began a years-long nightmare of further pain, culminating in an awful choice she must now make. Even two years later, Gulnaz remembers the smell and state of her rapist's clothes when he came into the house when her mother left for a brief visit to the hospital. \\"He had filthy clothes on as he does metal and construction work. When my mother went out, he came into my house and he closed doors and windows. I started screaming, but he shut me up by putting his hands on my mouth,\\" she said. The rapist was her cousin's husband. After the attack, she hid what happened as long as she could. But soon she began vomiting in the mornings and showing signs of pregnancy. It was her attacker's child. In Afghanistan, this brought her not sympathy, but prosecution. Aged just 19, she was found guilty by the courts of sex outside of marriage -- adultery -- and sentenced to twelve years in jail. Now inside Kabul's Badam Bagh jail, she and her child are serving her sentence together. Sitting with the baby in her lap, her face carefully covered, she explains the only choice she has that would end her incarceration. The only way around the dishonor of rape, or adultery in the eyes of Afghans, is to marry her attacker. This will, in the eyes of some, give her child a family and restore her honor. Incredibly, this is something that Gulnaz is willing to do. \\"I was asked if I wanted to start a new life by getting released, by marrying this man\\", she told CNN in an exclusive interview. \\"My answer was that one man dishonored me, and I want to stay with that man.\\" Tending to her daughter in the jail's cold, she added: \\"My daughter is a little innocent child. Who knew I would have a child in this way. A lot of people told me that after your daughter's born give it to someone else, but my aunt told me to keep her as proof of my innocence.\\" Gulnaz's choice is stark. Women in her situation are often killed for the shame their ordeal has brought the community. She is at risk, some say, from her attacker's family. We found Gulnaz's convicted rapist in a jail across town. While he denied raping her, he agreed that she would likely be killed if she gets out of jail. But he insists that it will be her family, not his, that will kill her, \\"out of shame.\\" Whether threatened by his family or hers, for now, jail may be the safest place for her. Shockingly, Gulnaz's case is common in Afghanistan. CNN asked a spokesman for the prosecutor to comment on the case. The reply was that there were hundreds such cases and the office would need time to look into it. But Gulnaz's plight has found international attention because of a dispute between the European Union and a team of documentary makers hired to report on women's rights in Afghanistan. The documentary makers filmed a lengthy report on Gulnaz and other women, showing her talking openly about her fate. They showed the film to the EU, who were paying for it as part of a project on female rights here. After viewing it, the EU decided to spike the project. The EU said it was concerned about the safety of the women in the film: they could be identified and might face reprisals. The filmmakers however suspect -- citing an email leaked from the EU delegation -- that the EU might also be motivated by its sensitive relationship with Afghan justice institutions, since he film shows the Afghan justice system in a very unflattering light. The leaked email says: \\"The delegation also has to consider its relations with [Afghan] Justice institutions in connection with the other work that it is doing in the sector.\\" The EU Ambassador to Afghanistan, Vygaudas Usackas, rejected any political motivation in asking for the film not to be shown. \\"What I am concerned about is that situation of the women. About the security and well being, that's of paramount importance, the key criteria according to which I, as representative of the European Union will judge,\\" said the ambassdor. Under Afghan law, Gulnaz has been judged an adulterer. Despite the ongoing dispute over her story, her predicament has not changed. She faces the hideous choice of 12 years in jail or marriage to her rapist and risk death. It's a marriage she says she'll accept, so her child can continue to have a mother.

Fridge temperatures were often set too high, allowing the growth of bacteria, which included E.coil, Enterobacteria, and S. aureus, all of which will give you an easy access to food poisoning. So what can you do to ensure your fridge---and your food in it---is not a health threat? For starters, clean the fridge weekly---wipe it and repeat. Make sure your fridge is at the correct temperature for storing food, between 0 and 5 degrees centigrade. Your freezer should be below-18 degrees centigrade. You can use fridge and freezer thermeters to make sure this is the case. Some modern fridges have zones to store different types of food ,such as meat and vegetables. Make sure you don\`t store meat in the vegetable zone, as the temperature there might be higher. Make sure you don not leave the door open too long as the temperature in the fridge will quickly rise, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. Cover food that has not been finished, and eat it within a couple of days. Keep bottles and jars closed. Keep raw meat away from cooked meat. Both should be well covered to prevent pollution. Store raw meat at the bottom of the fridge to stop juices dripping onto other foods. Finally, use common sense, and throw away old food. Question: Which is the best temperature for storing your food in the fridge? Options: A: 10oC B: -2 oC C: 4 oC D: -18 oC Answer:","completion":"C: 4 oC"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please add spaces between words: AccordingtotheBEAtheannualizedgrowthratehasincreasedfrom0.36of1%inthefirstquarterof2011tojustunder3%inthefourthquarter.","completion":"According to the BEA (Bureau of Economic Analysis), the annualized growth rate has increased from 0.36% or 1% in the first quarter of 2011 to just under 3% in the fourth quarter. The annualized growth rate, which measures the percentage increase over a year, is an important indicator of economic growth and overall economic health. In this case, the BEA is reporting that the growth rate has accelerated between the first quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter. The initial rate of 0.36% to 1% represents a relatively slow pace of growth. This suggests that the economy was not expanding rapidly during that period. This could be attributed to various factors, such as weak consumer demand, a lack of new investments, or uncertainties in the global economy. However, the fact that the growth rate increased to just under 3% in the fourth quarter indicates that the economy gained momentum over time. This acceleration could have been driven by several factors. For instance, increased consumer spending may have fueled business growth and helped create new jobs. Similarly, businesses may have started investing in new projects, thereby spurring economic growth. Moreover, this improvement in the growth rate may also be the result of government interventions aimed at stabilizing the economy, such as implementing monetary and fiscal policies. These policies could have included lowering interest rates to encourage borrowing and business expansion or introducing stimulus packages to boost consumer spending. It is also crucial to consider the global economic environment during this time. The financial performance of other countries and the state of international trade can significantly influence the growth rate of a nation's economy. In this context, any positive developments on the global front, such as a stable political environment or strong performance by trading partners, may have contributed to the increase in the annualized growth rate. In conclusion, according to the BEA, the annualized growth rate has shown a substantial improvement between the first quarter of 2011 (0.36% to 1%) and the fourth quarter (just under 3%). Various factors, such as increased consumer spending, business investment, government policies, and a stable global environment, could have contributed to this acceleration in economic growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Question: Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them. Does Brandon's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Jeff's? Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Brandon's soil appears to have less toxic compounds than Jeff's because it is not hypoxic. Hypoxic soils tend to have an increased presence of toxic compounds due to inhibited nitrification and the formation of toxic substances as anaerobic bacteria use alternative electron acceptors like nitrate, manganese, and sulfate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His only companions are an Australian Cattle Dog and a rare functioning firearm â a sawn-off shotgun â for which ammunition is very scarce. While trying to escape a group of gang members â led by a crazed motorcycle rider named Wez (Vernon Wells) - Max manages to crash two of the gang members' vehicles and injure Wez; recognising his defeat, Wez flees. After collecting some fuel from the destroyed cars and checking a nearby Mack semi, Max inspects a nearby autogyro for fuel. Its pilot, the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), ambushes Max and manages to capture him briefly before being overpowered. In exchange for his own life, the pilot guides Max to a small oil refinery nearby. Max arrives to see the facility is under siege by a gang of marauders riding a motley collection of cars and motorbikes. The gang leader, known as \\"Lord Humungus\\" (Kjell Nilsson), tries to convince the refinery's defenders to surrender the facility in exchange for safe passage out of the area. A group of defenders attempts to break out of the compound, but the marauders capture, torture, and kill all but one of them, who is rescued by Max. Max makes a deal with the mortally-wounded sole survivor: he will bring him back to the compound in exchange for a tank of fuel.

Here is a question about this article: To the pope as to all his predecessors, marital relations are much more than a union of two people. They constitute a union of the loving couple with a loving God, in which the two persons create a new person materially, while God completes the creation by adding the soul. For this reason, Paul VI teaches in the first sentence of Humanae vitae that the transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator. This divine partnership, according to Paul VI, does not allow for arbitrary human decisions, which may limit divine providence. The Pope does not paint an overly romantic picture of marriage: marital relations are a source of great joy, but also of difficulties and hardships. The question of human procreation exceeds in the view of Paul VI specific disciplines such as biology, psychology, demography or sociology. The reason for this, according to Paul VI, is that married love takes its origin from God, who \\"is love\\". From this basic dignity, he defines his position: What is the answer to this question: What does God contribute to a married couple's child?","completion":"According to the article, God contributes the soul to a married couple's child.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. On the campaign trail, Otto Perez Molina vowed to rule his country with an iron fist. The retired general said he would send troops into the streets to fight drug violence. Analysts summed up his political platform with three words: law and order. Now -- just two months after taking office -- the 61-year-old Guatemalan president is pushing a controversial proposal that has come under fire from U.S. officials and earned praise from people who were once his critics. During a routine speech last month, Perez Molina slipped in a surprise announcement. Last year's law-and-order candidate said he wanted to legalize drugs. \\"What I have done is put the issue back on the table,\\" Perez Molina told CNN en Español. \\"I think it is important for us to have other alternatives. ... We have to talk about decriminalization of the production, the transit and, of course, the consumption.\\" The proposal caught many Guatemalans off guard. \\"Everyone was expecting him to copy the strategy of (Mexican President) Felipe Calderon and involve the military in fighting cartels,\\" said Martin Rodriguez Pellecer, director of Plaza Publica, an investigative journalism and analysis website in Guatemala. \\"Then he made this surprise announcement ... without even his foreign minister knowing about it.\\" The president's unexpected pitch grabbed global headlines -- and the attention of international leaders. Central American presidents are scheduled to debate the idea in Guatemala on Saturday. The meeting could pave the way for a significant policy shift in a region where brutal drug violence is a daily reality. 'Too high a human cost' The attackers left a warning written in blood on a white wall at a northern Guatemala farm: \\"I will find you and I will leave you like this.\\" Nearby, investigators found the bodies of 27 dismembered and decapitated workers. Authorities said members of the Zetas drug gang were behind the massacre last May in the province of Peten. Officials and analysts pointed to the slayings as more evidence of a devastating spike in drug-related violence across the region. At a conference on regional security last year, Guatemala's then-president, Alvaro Colom, said his country was reaching the limit of its ability to fight cartels. \\"Eight killed per ton (of cocaine) passing through Guatemala is a lot of blood. If you pass through Honduras, there are 20 murders, and if we add it up, a ton of cocaine has too high a human cost,\\" he said. Guatemala's murder rate is 42 per 100,000 people -- one of the highest in the world, according to a United Nations report. \\"The immense economic power of drug trafficking has corrupted all the spheres of the state. The violence is incredibly high,\\" said Mario David Garcia, a well-known Guatemalan lawyer and radio show host. Perez Molina isn't the first leader to propose that legalizing drugs may help stem the bloodshed. In a 2009 report, three former Latin American presidents -- Brazil's Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Colombia's Cesar Gaviria, and Mexico's Ernesto Zedillo -- called for decriminalizing cannabis for personal use. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox also has said he supports legalizing marijuana use. But analysts say sitting presidents rarely make such proposals, fearing political consequences. \\"This has been an academic debate and it has also been a scientific debate, an issue that has been studied. And bringing it back into political debate, I think, is important,\\" Perez Molina told CNN en Español last month. A political strategy? U.S. officials responded swiftly to Perez Molina's proposal. \\"The United States continues to oppose such measures because evidence shows that our shared drug problem is a major public health and safety threat,\\" the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala said in a statement a day after Perez Molina first floated his proposal. The embassy urged Guatemala and other countries in the region to continue fighting drug traffickers. \\"With increased cultivation and consumption of decriminalized drugs, crime in Central America could well increase as the drug cartels shift their focus to other forms of illicit activities,\\" the statement warned. Weeks later, on a trip to Mexico and Honduras, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said he was open to debating the issue. But he stressed that the United States would not waver from its policy against drug legalization. \\"If (Perez Molina's) strategy is a political strategy designed to get Washington's attention, then it worked,\\" said Samuel Logan, managing director of Southern Pulse, an online information network focused on Latin America. Some skeptics have suggested Perez Molina may be bluffing -- using the legalization debate to pressure U.S. officials into bringing back military aid to Guatemala. Such aid has been cut off for decades due to human rights abuses committed during the Central American nation's civil war. Guatemalan Defense Minister Ulises Noe Anzueto told CNN en Español Thursday that he was meeting with officials in Washington to discuss lifting the military aid embargo. \\"It's a question of a political decision,\\" he said. \\"At any moment this restriction could be lifted and help us become more efficient partners in meeting our responsibility to help with security for the region and therefore the continent.\\" John Walters, who directed the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy from 2001 to 2009, said decriminalization is \\"utterly self-defeating\\" and would cause more crime. He described Perez Molina's proposal as \\"a call for help and a call for U.S. leadership.\\" \\"They're telling us, 'We think we have to give up, because we don't think we can win,\\" Walters said. Details unclear as debate nears. Supporters of Perez Molina say Latin American nations should create new drug policies that don't follow in U.S. footsteps. The United States has not done enough to stop the demand for drugs, they argue, and many in Latin America are suffering the consequences. \\"All we're doing is, in effect, fighting a U.S. battle outside of U.S. borders,\\" said Ambassador Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister of Mexico who advocates drug legalization. Creating a regulated market and opting for a less militaristic approach should decrease violence, he said. \\"The fundamental problem of the violence ... is directly related to this so-called war on the cartels and this war on drug trafficking and the effort by the criminals to show that they have more money, more weapons, more people,\\" Rozental said. But could drug legalization efforts in the region work without U.S. backing? \\"Even if the United States is not willing at this point to go along, there is space for Latin American countries to take certain steps,\\" said Martin Jelsma, a political scientist who specializes in Latin America and international drugs policy at the Transnational Institute. \\"Of course, politically, that will be one of the questions. How much pressure will the United States put on Latin America to prevent this?\\" Details about the ideas Central American leaders will debate Saturday have not been released to the public. Perez Molina plans to present a range of proposals at the meeting, Guatemala's foreign minster said. Drug legalization is also expected to come up before a wider audience of regional leaders at next month's Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia. Rodriguez, the director of Plaza Publica, said Saturday's meeting will be a promising start to the debate, even if it takes years to hash out the details. \\"It wouldn't surprise me if in the next decade there would be a Latin American agreement to legalize drugs,\\" he said. But some analysts were more doubtful that other countries in the region would follow Perez Molina's lead. \\"Publicly, I would be very surprised if they stand behind this,\\" said Logan, of Southern Pulse. Jelsma said he hoped the leaders would weigh other drug policy changes, in addition to legalization. \\"I fear that this debate could lead into deadlock,\\" he said. \\"From the current situation, to jump to legalization as an answer to all these problems that are getting worse, I think it's a recipe for a debate that will get stuck pretty soon.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article talks about Otto Perez Molina, the President of Guatemala, who wants to legalize drugs in his country. He believes that legalizing drugs could help stop the bad things that happen because of drug-related violence. Some people agree with him, but others think it's not a good idea, like the United States. They believe that if drugs are legal, crime might increase.

Identify any emotions or sentiments expressed by the author 3. Interpret the context of the tweet 4.

The author communicates their feelings about their sleep schedule and an upcoming event they are attending. Step 2: Identify any emotions or sentiments expressed by the author There are two sentiments expressed in the tweet: - Frustration or annoyance: \\"back on my stupid sleep schedule\\" - Mild relief or positivity: \\"Luckily church isn't until 2 tomorrow\\" Step 3: Interpret the context of the tweet The author is likely speaking to their followers on social media, sharing their experience of having a disrupted or inconsistent sleep schedule and acknowledging that they are fortunate that their church event is later in the day, giving them time to adjust. Step 4: Determine the positivity, negativity, or neutrality of the sentiment The sentiment in this tweet is a mix of both negativity, expressed through the frustration about their sleep schedule, and positivity, as they recognize the convenience of the later church event. As such, the sentiment can be described as \\"mixed\\" or \\"neutral,\\" as neither emotion appears to significantly outweigh the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do I stop myself from overthinking and making scenarios in my head that are never going to happen and go to sleep easily? How can I make myself go to sleep without wearing myself out completely? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"To address your first question on how to stop yourself from overthinking and making scenarios in your head that are never going to happen and go to sleep easily, here are some step-by-step suggestions: 1. Create a calming bedtime routine: Establishing a routine before bed can signal to your brain that it's time to sleep. This might include activities such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation. 2. Limit exposure to screens: Blue light emitted from devices like phones, tablets, and computers can disrupt your natural sleep cycle. Try to turn off these devices an hour before bed to help your brain transition to a sleep state. 3. Make your sleeping environment comfortable: Ensure that your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. You may also try using a white noise machine or earplugs to block out any disturbances. 4. Write down your thoughts: If your mind is racing with thoughts, try writing them down in a journal before bed. This can help alleviate the burden of overthinking and allow your mind to relax. 5. Set a regular sleep schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day helps regulate your sleep cycle and can make falling asleep and waking up easier. 6. Limit caffeine and alcohol intake: Caffeine can have a long-lasting effect on your body that can disrupt sleep, while alcohol can interfere with your sleep quality. Limiting the intake of these substances, especially in the evening, can help improve your sleep. For your second question about how to make yourself go to sleep without wearing yourself out completely, here are some suggestions: 1. Prioritize relaxation: Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation before bedtime. 2. Get regular exercise: Engage in moderate aerobic exercise on a daily basis, but avoid exercising too close to bedtime, as it can sometimes make it harder to fall asleep. 3. Limit naps: Taking long naps during the day can disrupt your sleep at night. Limit naps to 20-30 minutes and avoid napping too close to bedtime. 4. Experiment with sleep aids: Some people find that herbal remedies like chamomile tea or melatonin supplements can help promote sleep. Speak with your doctor before trying any new sleep aids, especially if you take medication or have a medical condition. As for your final question, the two questions are similar and have some overlap, but they're not exactly the same. The first question focuses on stopping overthinking and making scenarios in your head, while the second question emphasizes making it easier to fall asleep without exhausting oneself. The suggested steps to address both concerns can help improve overall sleep quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Officials on the Iraqi side of the border said they could hear heavy gunfire and shelling. Kurdish groups in northern Syria have tried to stay out of the civil war between the government and rebels. However as Islamist rebel groups have moved into Kurdish-controlled areas in recent months, clashes between them and Kurdish militias have been increasing. An Iraqi official told the Associated Press that the Baghdad government had brought Iraqi reinforcements to its side of the border to prevent the violence spilling over. He described the fighting as \\"heavy battles in which all types of weapons were used\\". The border crossing was under the Syrian government's control until March, when it was taken by Islamist rebels. Syria's Kurdish minority makes up around 10% of the population and is largely concentrated in the country's far north-east, near the borders with Turkey and Iraq.

Soil contains various essential minerals that play a significant role in human health and body processes. These minerals are naturally occurring in the earth's crust and are absorbed by plants, which are then consumed by humans and other animals, providing the body with the necessary nutrients. Some key minerals found in the soil include calcium, potassium, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus. These minerals perform various functions in the human body, such as: 1. Calcium: This mineral is essential for the development and maintenance of strong bones and teeth. It also plays a significant role in muscle contractions, nerve function, blood clotting, and regulating heartbeat. 2. Potassium: Potassium is crucial for maintaining a balance of fluids in the body, regulating blood pressure, and supporting proper nerve and muscle functions, including the heart. 3. Iron: Iron is an essential mineral for forming hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen throughout the body. It also has a role in energy production and maintaining a healthy immune system. 4. Magnesium: This mineral is vital for over 300 biochemical reactions in the body, including nerve and muscle function, maintaining a healthy immune system, and bone health. Magnesium also supports a steady heartbeat and helps regulate glucose levels. 5. Phosphorus: Phosphorus is crucial for the formation and maintenance of bones and teeth, energy production, and cell growth.

Apple Photoshopped a NSFW joke out of its WWDC keynote During Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook offered to pay off a playful \\"ransom note\\" composed by members of the Cleveland Indians baseball team — a list that mostly consisted of demands for Apple products. But there was one NSFW item etched onto the original list that Apple had to Photoshop out before giving it stage time. For those who didn't watch the keynote live stream, here's the back story: When Major League Baseball player Brandon Moss, the first baseman for the Indians, recently earned his 100th home run, the ball landed in the team's bullpen. Rather than handing over his keepsake, his teammates grabbed it and wrote a ransom note for what they wanted in exchange. The requests ranged from iPhones and iPads to brand new MacBooks and an Apple Watch. Clearly, Cook was pleased with the wish list and said he'd be willing to make each request come true. While all the items seemed innocent enough, Twitter user Andrew Martin (first spotted by The Verge) was quick to point out that there was one clear omission when it was displayed behind Cook during the keynote: the request for a \\"50 gallon drum of lube.\\" Apple photoshopped #Windians ransom note, mod'ing Zep's request to be more family friendly. #wwdc15 pic.twitter.com/z5u2GjuB0T — Andrew Martin (@andrewcmartin) June 8, 2015 The demand came from Indians relief pitcher Marc Rzepcynski, known as \\"Zep,\\" who said he wanted a generous portion of lubricant in addition to an Apple Watch.

Burton was born to American parents at the U.S. Army Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in West Germany. His mother, Erma Gene (nee Christian), was a social worker, administrator, and educator. His father, Levardis Robert Martyn Burton, was a photographer for the U.S. Army Signal Corps at the time he was stationed at Landstuhl. Burton and his two sisters were raised by his mother in Sacramento, California. Burton was the host and executive producer of Reading Rainbow starting in 1983 for PBS. The series ran for 23 seasons, making it one of the longest-running children's programs on the network. The series garnered over 200 broadcast awards over its run, including a Peabody Award and 26 Emmy Awards, 11 of which were in the Outstanding Children's Series category. Burton himself won 12 Emmy awards as host and producer of the show. After Reading Rainbow went off the air in 2006, Burton and his business partner, Mark Wolfe, acquired the global rights to the brand and formed RRKIDZ, a new media company for children. Reading Rainbow was reimagined as an all new application for the iPad in 2012, and was an immediate success, becoming the number-one educational application within 36 hours. At RRKIDZ, Burton serves as co-founder and curator-in-chief, ensuring that the projects produced under the banner meet the high expectations and trust of the Reading Rainbow brand. On May 28, 2014, Burton and numerous coworkers from other past works started a Kickstarter campaign project to bring back Reading Rainbow. To keep with the changing formats to which young children are exposed, his efforts are being directed at making this new program web-based, following the success of the tablet application he helped create in recent years. His desire is to have the new Reading Rainbow be integrated into the classrooms of elementary schools across the country, and for schools in need to have free access. The Kickstarter campaign has since raised over 5 million, reaching triple its goal in only three days.

The world's most popular Pinterest users are earning up to 250,000 a year, thanks to an increasing number of lucrative endorsements and brand collaborations arranged via a select group of Pinterest-focused talent agencies. According to Kyla Brennan, founder of HelloSociety, one of the top Pinterest agencies in the country, big name brands, including Kmart, Sephora and Kate Spade, are lining up to work with her clients - many of whom boast upwards of 1.8 million followers on the site. 'Pinterest is built for commerce,' the 29-year-old, whose Los Angeles-based agency pulled 12.5 million in revenue last year, told Re/Code. Under the Pinfluence: Pinterest's most popular users can make as much as 250,00 a year, according to Kyla Brennan, whose talent agency HelloSociety launched this board for Sephora's Formula X nail polishes. Indeed, some of the projects her clients have worked on have proved so successful for brands that they have diverted funds away from advertising on other social media platforms in order to invest more money in Pinterest which, as she points out, is ripe for retail partnerships given its catalogue-like setup. According to HelloSociety's website, previous projects completed by its pinners include creating recipes to promote major motion pictures, shooting editorial-style outfit inspiration for clothing lines, and coming up with crafts inspired by the spokeswoman for an auto insurance company. Fashion and beauty brands such as Kate Spade, Gap and Sephora have commissioned boards from HelloSociety's 350-plus pinners. Intelligent design: 'Pinterest is built for commerce,' said 29-year-old entrepreneur Ms Brennan (pictured) As opposed to sites like YouTube, where overnight celebrities are made through viral success, many of Pinterest's most followed users are simply those who were early adopters of the platform, and thus were recommended to new users. One would be hard-pressed to name a famous 'Pinfluencer', and Ms Brennan understands why the idea of one making a six-figure sum could raise skepticism. 'People hear Pinterest star and they’re like, \\"what?!\\",' she said. 'But after three years of doing this, seeing clients making hundreds of thousands of dollars and quit their jobs and pin full time, it’s real.' Pinterest star: Lauren Zwanziger, of Nashville, Tennessee, has close to five million followers, and is represented by HelloSociety. She adds that it’s much harder to get a huge audience in Pinterest than on other social networks, making Pinfluencers particularly valuable.

In late 1920, the Persian Soviet Socialist Republic in Rasht was preparing to march on Tehran with \\"a guerrilla force of 1,500 Jangalis, Kurds, Armenians and Azerbaijanis\\", reinforced by the Bolsheviks' Red Army. This fact, along with various other disorders, mutinies and unrest in the country created \\"an acute political crisis in the capital.\\" By 1921, the ruling Qajar dynasty of Persia had become corrupt and inefficient. The oil-rich nation was somewhat reliant on the nations of Britain and Russia for military and economic support. Civil wars earlier in the decade had threatened the government, and the only regular military force at the time was the Cossack Brigade. The Qajar shah in 1921 was Ahmad, who had been crowned at the age of eleven. He was considered to be a weak, incompetent ruler, especially after British, Russian and Ottoman occupations of Persia during World War I. In 1911, when the capital city, Tehran, had been seized by the Russians, armed Bakhtiaris tribemen, rather than Iranian regular troops, expelled the invaders. This further diminished the government's reputation, rendering it almost powerless in time of war. Britain, which played a major role in Persia, was dismayed by the Qajar government's inability to rule efficiently. This inefficiency was the background of a power struggle between Britain and Russia, each nation hoping to control Persia. On 14 January 1921, the British General Ironside chose to promote Reza Khan, who had been leading the Tabriz battalion, to lead the entire brigade. About a month later, under British direction, Reza Khan's 3,000-4,000 strong detachment of the Cossack Brigade reached Tehran.

Jerry studies alpine climate, while James studies tropical climates. They both made great progress. Which person observed that the climate becomes colder at high elevations? Hint: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate. Answer:","completion":"Jerry observed that the climate becomes colder at high elevations. He studies alpine climate, which is the average weather for the alpine tundra. As mentioned in the hint, the lapse rate of air causes the climate to get colder at higher elevations. This is a key characteristic of alpine climates, so it would be Jerry who made this observation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It sounds like a lot of fun, doesn't it? Let's dive into how we can do this! First, we need to know what a stomp rocket is. It is a toy that looks like a little rocket ship, and it can fly high up in the sky if we launch it just right. But how will we launch it? With our feet, of course! We will stomp on a litter bottle to make it go whoosh. So, what do we need? We need a stomp rocket and a launcher, and also a liter bottle. Make sure you get a grown-up's permission and help, as we need to take care of safety while playing. Let's start by preparing our rocket. We will use the launcher that comes with the rocket, and here is how we set it up: 1. Find a flat, open space outdoors, like a playground or your backyard. 2. Place the launcher on the ground, and make sure it is steady and secure. 3. Now, we are going to slide the rocket onto the launcher. Be gentle so that you don't break it. Make sure it fits snugly. Great job! Now that our rocket is ready on the launcher, let's get our liter bottle. Make sure the bottle is empty and that the cap is tightly closed. Here comes the fun part! We're going to stomp on the liter bottle to launch our rocket: 1. Stand next to the launcher, with the liter bottle in your hand. 2. Hold the bottle sideways, with the bottom facing the launcher. 3. Get ready to stomp! Make sure you have a good balance, and remember, safety first! 4. Using your foot, stomp down hard on the bottom of the bottle. Whoosh! Your rocket will now shoot up high into the sky. Watch how it soars and see how far it goes. Isn't it exciting? Remember, always play safely, and keep practicing your stomps. You'll become a stomp rocket expert in no time. Have fun with your rocket adventures!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: What institution was recommended by William Laver? Answer the above question based on the context below: Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

That night, a frustrated Paul goes out for a walk and quickly encounters a mugger who attempts to rob him with a gun. Carrying a sock full of quarters, Paul swings it at the would-be-mugger and flees, narrowly escaping from being shot.The next day, Paul's boss gives him an extended business vacation to Tucson, Arizona to meet a client, Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin), who shows him the ropes.

Step 1: Analyze the first sentence - \\"Point the letter.\\" In this sentence, \\"point\\" seems to be used as a verb, meaning to direct or guide something towards a specific direction or target. In this case, \\"point\\" is telling someone to direct the letter towards something or someone. Step 2: Analyze the second sentence - \\"The dancer's toes pointed outward.\\" In this sentence, \\"pointed\\" is also used as a verb, but with a different meaning. It refers to the positioning or orientation of the dancer's toes, which are facing outward. In this context, \\"point\\" is used to describe the direction in which the toes are facing. Step 3: Compare the meanings of \\"point\\" in both sentences. While both instances of \\"point\\" are used as verbs to indicate the direction of something, the context and specific meaning differ. In the first sentence, \\"point\\" is used as a command to direct something (the letter) towards a target. In the second sentence, \\"point\\" is used to describe the positioning of a body part (the dancer's toes) in relation to the rest of the body.

From the warm welcome we received upon entering to the outstanding service and, of course, the mouth-watering cuisine, Blue Rose Bistro truly exceeded all my expectations and won my heart over. Upon our arrival, despite being a busy Friday night, we were greeted warmly by the hostess who promptly escorted us to our reserved table. The ambiance of the restaurant struck the perfect balance between cozy and upscale, with dim romantic lighting, soothing tunes playing in the background, and tasteful decor that allowed the star of the evening - the food - to shine. Our attentive and accommodating server wasted no time in introducing herself and ensuring that our extensive dietary needs and preferences were taken into account. She showcased her knowledge of the menu and made exceptional recommendations that suited the diverse tastes in our party. The delightful culinary journey began with a complimentary amuse-bouche, a delectable surprise that perfectly teased our palates. The starter selection introduced us to the chef's remarkable skills, as each dish was impeccably balanced and burst with unique and daring flavor combinations. A notable standout was the heirloom tomato salad, accented with a refreshing mint-infused vinaigrette and topped with creamy burrata. The pièce de résistance was, without a doubt, the main courses. Blue Rose Bistro offers a vibrant selection of dishes that cater to all tastes, from the most carnivorous food lover to the most particular vegetarian. I savored every single bite of my pan-seared salmon, which was wonderfully tender and cooked to perfection, served on a bed of creamy risotto and adorned with a lip-smacking lemon caper sauce. My dining companions were equally blown away by their chosen dishes, raving about the succulent, perfectly seasoned lamb chops, and the innovative mushroom truffle gnocchi that left them scraping their plates clean. No culinary adventure is complete without a grand finale, and desserts at Blue Rose Bistro did not disappoint. Each dessert we ordered was a sumptuous treat - from the decadent chocolate lava cake to the tangy yet creamy lemon cheesecake, every bite was a clear testament to the pastry chef's expertise. To complement our meal, the extensive wine list provided a bevy of options to choose from, with a knowledgeable sommelier readily available to guide us in our decision-making. The wine we chose turned out to be an ideal accompaniment to our meal, and our glasses were attentively refilled throughout the evening. Needless to say, Blue Rose Bistro has left an indelible mark in my memory, and I cannot wait to return to indulge in their exceptional culinary offerings once again. A restaurant that seamlessly combines hospitality, atmosphere, and excellent cuisine deserves every bit of the praise, and I highly recommend Blue Rose Bistro to locals and visitors alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself. Want to know how often the exercisers experienced “adverse events”? (Hint: often!) Wondering just what the structured exercise program involved? (Hint: more than walking!) Let’s dig into the details! At the end of this post, I’ll share my list of key take-home points for older adults and family caregivers. Who were the study volunteers? Whenever you read about a research study, it’s important to understand how the study volunteers compare to the older adults in *your* life. One of... Question: When the LIFE study was over, who walked better? Options: - neither group - not enough information - those in the exercise program - those in the healthy education group === The correct answer is A:","completion":"When the LIFE study was over, those in the exercise program walked better. This can be inferred from the results of the study, which showed that a structured exercise program was more effective than a healthy aging education program in avoiding \\"major mobility disability\\" among older adults. Specifically, the research found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. The encouraging finding in this study suggests that engaging in a structured exercise program can significantly improve the mobility and independence of older adults. Even though almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility (with half lasting 6 months or more), the results indicate that exercise can play a major role in reducing the risk and severity of mobility issues in the elderly population. This study's outcomes can be of great help not only to older adults but also to family caregivers and geriatricians who aim to improve the quality of life of the aging population. The LIFE study sheds light on the importance of exercise in maintaining and promoting mobility, independence, and overall health for older adults. In summary, the structured exercise program had a more positive impact on the mobility of the older adults in the study. Consequently, encouraging an older person to start exercising could be a worthwhile and essential effort in promoting their overall health, well-being, and independence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs.

Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"Yes, based on the given text, it appears that the historical version of Christian liturgy that followed the Gallican Rite is the Old Gallican Rite, as it is mentioned in reference to the use of the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic. The Old Gallican Rite is an early and regionally diverse form of Christian liturgy that was used in Gaul, which is the region now known as modern-day France, Belgium, and parts of Germany. This rite coexisted with other liturgical rites, such as the Roman Rite and the Byzantine Rite, but it was eventually replaced and standardized under the influence of the Roman Rite within the Christian church. The Old Gallican Rite had its origins in the 5th century and was influenced by various regional and cultural traditions. It was characterized by its rich ceremonial practices and elaborate liturgical texts. As mentioned in the given text, some significant vestments associated with this rite include the Celtic alb, which resembled an ungirdled liturgical tunic, and the surplice, which was typically a full-length Old English style surplice. Within the context of the paleo-orthodox and emerging church movements, there is an interest in returning to these more ancient and diverse liturgical traditions as a way of reconnecting with the ecumenical past and broadening the understanding of Christian worship across different denominations. The Old Gallican Rite serves as an example of the rich heritage of early Christian liturgy that can inform and enhance contemporary worship practices, especially among Protestant and evangelical churches seeking to explore their historical roots and reexamine the liturgical expressions of their faith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

The band has a great, compact and tight sound which I liked immediately. The sound is very similar to the Stones material from their \\"Exile\\" era. I'm a big Stones fan, and new material just isn't coming...I would say it's not exactly like new Stones material, but clearly the next best thing. The songs and music are quite good. I'm giving this 5 stars, and would buy more material from this band. If you're a big Stones fan, I'd almost guarantee that you'll like this album. What is also appealing is, in my opinion, the fact that I do not get the impression that the band is trying to sound like the Stones (unlike the Black Crowes, for example). It's highly enjoyable music and I recommend it. Answer:","completion":"The customer was satisfied with the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sam checked the weather to see if he would need his hat and his umbrella, as he would only need the Select from the following. (A). umbrella if it was rainy. (B). hat if it was rainy. Answer:","completion":"(A). umbrella if it was rainy. Sam checked the weather to see if he would need his hat and his umbrella, as he would only need the umbrella if it was raining. The sky had been relatively clear all morning, but clouds had begun to roll in from the west, casting an uncertain light over what had been a bright and sunny day. As the weather forecast loaded on his phone, Sam pondered the importance of always being prepared for changes in climate, particularly in his region where sudden rainstorms were not uncommon. The app displayed a warning of scattered showers in the afternoon, followed by a 60% chance of more substantial rain later in the evening. Sam sighed, but he was not particularly surprised by the forecast. He knew the importance of keeping his belongings dry and his head protected from the elements, especially as he had a history of catching colds easily. He went to the closet, grabbed his umbrella, and placed it by the front door in preparation for his departure later that morning. While he only needed the umbrella if it was raining, Sam decided to bring his hat along as well. Although it might not serve the same purpose as the umbrella in terms of keeping him dry, he found that wearing a hat often helped in shielding him from the sometimes chilly winds that could arise just before a storm. He thought back to previous incidents when he had been caught unprepared in this kind of weather, shivering and miserable as the rain drenched him to his core. This time, however, Sam vowed that he would not allow Mother Nature to have her way with him so easily. As he donned his hat and tied a secure knot to keep the strap beneath his chin in place, Sam felt a renewed sense of determination. He would go about his day without the fear of inclement weather, confident in the protective measures he had taken. He glanced once more at his umbrella, standing tall and proud by the door, a symbol of his defiance against the unpredictable elements that had caused him so much discomfort in the past. With a satisfied nod, Sam turned away and went about finishing his morning routine, grateful for the foresight to check the weather and prepared for whatever the day had in store for him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

James Paul McCartney was born on 18 June 1942 in Walton Hospital, Liverpool, England, where his mother, Mary Patricia (nee Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James (\\"Jim\\") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War II. McCartney has one younger brother named Michael. McCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by other bassists, including Sting, Dr. Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC. Best known for primarily using a plectrum or pick, McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle. He does not use slapping techniques. He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, whom McCartney called a hero for his melodic style. He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: \\"because he went to very unusual places\\". Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke. During McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a Hofner 500/1 bass, although from 1965, he favoured his Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967 he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, in contrast to the much lighter Hofner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Hofner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live. MacDonald identified \\"She's a Woman\\" as the turning point when McCartney's bass playing began to evolve dramatically, and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out Rubber Soul as the moment when McCartney's playing exhibited significant progress, particularly on \\"The Word\\". Bacon and Morgan agreed, calling McCartney's groove on the track \\"a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument.\\" MacDonald inferred the influence of James Brown's \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\\" and Wilson Pickett's \\"In the Midnight Hour\\", American soul tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he \\"delivered his most spontaneous bass-part to date\\". Bacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song \\"Rain\\" as \\"an astonishing piece of playing ... [McCartney] thinking in terms of both rhythm and 'lead bass' ... [choosing] the area of the neck ... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove.\\" MacDonald identified the influence of Indian classical music in \\"exotic melismas in the bass part\\" on \\"Rain\\" and described the playing as \\"so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track\\". By contrast, he recognised McCartney's bass part on the Harrison-composed \\"Something\\" as creative but overly busy and \\"too fussily extemporised\\". McCartney identified Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing, particularly on \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\". McCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' Hamburg days, when they often used Preludin to maintain their energy while performing for long periods. Bob Dylan introduced them to marijuana in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting \\"very high\\" and \\"giggling uncontrollably\\". His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics \\"another kind of mind\\" in \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\" specifically as a reference to cannabis. During the filming of Help!, McCartney occasionally smoked a joint in the car on the way to the studio during filming, and often forgot his lines. Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused. Introduced to cocaine by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and for about a year total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards. Initially reluctant to try LSD, McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and took his second \\"acid trip\\" in March 1967, with Lennon, after a Sgt. Pepper studio session. He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring, \\"It opened my eyes ... [and] made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society.\\" He made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, along with the other Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in The Times, which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney PS1,000 for cannabis possession. Soon after, Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for illegal cultivation and a PS100 fine. As a result of his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973. Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975, in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8 ounces (200 g) of cannabis in his luggage. They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, they released and deported him without charge. In 1984, while McCartney was on holiday in Barbados, authorities arrested him for possession of marijuana and fined him 200. Upon his return to England, he stated: \\"cannabis is ... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are perfectly legal ... I don't think ... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever.\\" In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of the drug: \\"People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong.\\" He did however, decide to quit cannabis in 2015, citing a desire to set a good example for his grandchildren. On 9 December 1980, McCartney followed the news that Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: \\"It's a drag\\". The press quickly criticised him for what appeared to be a superficial response. He later explained, \\"When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, \\"It's a drag\\".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make.\\" He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon: I talked to Yoko the day after he was killed, and the first thing she said was, \\"John was really fond of you.\\" The last telephone conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, \\"it's only me.\\" They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure. In 1983, McCartney said, \\"I would not have been as typically human and standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die. I would have made more of an effort to try and get behind his \\"mask\\" and have a better relationship with him.\\" He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he said that Lennon's death made the remaining ex-Beatles nervous that they might also be murdered. He told Mojo magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero. In 1981, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, \\"All Those Years Ago\\", which featured Starr on drums. McCartney released \\"Here Today\\" in 1982, a song Everett described as \\"a haunting tribute\\" to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.

Instead, a more appropriate and detailed answer would be: Throughout its history, Afghanistan has witnessed several conflicts and struggles for power. In particular, two empires that fought to control Afghanistan were the British Empire and the Russian Empire during a period known as The Great Game. The Great Game took place throughout the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century, representing the struggle for dominance over Central Asia. The British Empire, fearing the expansion of Russian influence toward the Indian subcontinent, wanted to maintain Afghanistan as a buffer zone between the two empires. They hoped that establishing a friendly government in Afghanistan would prevent Russian influence from seeping into British India. On the other hand, the Russian Empire sought to expand its territories and influence in Central Asia, which would bring them closer to British India, a prized colony for the British Empire. There were multiple wars fought as part of The Great Game. The First Anglo-Afghan War (1839–1842) saw the British invading Afghanistan in an attempt to establish a sympathetic government that could keep the Russians at bay. The war ended with British withdrawal, having failed to achieve their goals. The Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878-1880) saw another British invasion, only for them to later withdraw, but not before securing some control over Afghanistan's foreign affairs. The final conflict was the Third Anglo-Afghan War (1919), which resulted in Afghanistan gaining its independence from British influence and maintaining neutrality between the British and the Russians. Thus, the two empires that fought to control Afghanistan were the British Empire and the Russian Empire during the period known as The Great Game, primarily driven by the desire to establish dominance and influence over the region and to protect their respective territories."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: Have you ever had a cool image in your mind that you thought it would be nice to be in a movie: Like seeing a detective peeking through the cracks of a broken fence of some abandoned house? Or seeing a woman walking down a street looking cold and intense and awfully alert? Yeah. Imagine stretching that image to a whole movie, you pretty much got the idea of Broken, though there's no detectives in this movie, I'm just using it as a visual example. But, the intense looking woman is here and she filled pretty much 99% of the screen time. I got nothing to complain about that woman, she's a perfect choice for this role. I consider myself a very open minded individual who can find enjoyment out of all kinds of artistic expressions and I can truly enjoy some really moody stuff. It would be really cool if I can frame one of the scene from this movie and hang it on the wall. Let's be honest here, the acting is superb. Some of the expressions on the actors face are what keep me watching. Now onto the problem of this movie. Beyond the mood, there's not much anything else here. The director basically took an obsession of an idea and ran it far beyond what it was worth. I don't consider it to be a spoiler if I say the obsession is \\"mirror\\". Let's face it, this singular idea is all over the bloody place and that's all the director got to work with. Granted, there are a few twist and turn here and there. If you paid any attention, nothing is going to surprise you in the end, obvious plot holes aside. Now, I'm not picking bones with this style of art since I enjoyed them most of the time. I still believe that we should judge an art base on the medium it uses to express whatever the artists want to express. Movie is not a piece of music, or a picture, or a painting, or even a poem, and certainly not just a cool image in your mind. It's all that plus a good story and character development. I consider the Lynch style of movie making cheating. It is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium. We gave movies 2 hours running film time for a good reason. Therefore, we should judge it differently than judging a single frame of imagery such as a photograph or a painting. This movie is not completely Lynch style, thank goodness. It has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion. It does not have much story or character development. It presented itself rather seriously with characters composed of common folks, thus distance itself from other fantasy stuff at least from the surface. It does not offer any explanation of the fantasy element nor did it ever attempt to build a coherent world around it. The oddity came from nowhere and seems rather isolated and accidental. Maybe the coherency remains in director's head but from what I can see he did not put much effort into realizing it on the screen. Where did he put his effort in then? It seems that he spent a lot of effort in building the mood and enhancing it with the music. The music often built up tension which eventually turn into a tease. Only in the later part of the movie the scare and tension materialized. In the end, I felt like: OK, I know what you are trying to say here but is that the point you are trying to make by spending two hours building up all these tension? It is rather irrelevant with who the characters are and what kind of life they have. And we are given very little about who the characters are. All we have is this circumstance that just took placed.

Question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: If you have ever been rock climbing, you will know that it is not a very easy sport. In fact, you probably felt quite defeated when you first tried to do any serious climbing. Indoor and outdoor rock climbing are both extremely demanding and require practice to get good at. It is one of the most physically and mentally demanding sports. There are three basic types of rock climbing. Top roping is the most common type and the climber need to climb with a partner. The second type, which is very similar to top roping, is called lead climbing. In both of the types, the climber can sit off the wall and rest on the rope. The third type is called bouldering. Bouldering is a type of free climbing without any ropes. This is the most demanding of all climbing types. The climber must be able to complete the climbing without taking a rest on the rope. Believe it or not, climbing is said to be about 75% legs and only 25% arms. To climb efficiently and successfully, a person needs to have a wonderful technique. One of the major rules of rock climbing is to always have three points touching the wall, whether it is both feet and one hand, or one foot and both hands, as it is much easier to have your weight cases will not do the climbing; they only hold you into the wall so that your legs are actually pushing you upward. Also, the closer you are to the wall, the easier it is to climb. Rock climbing may sound a bit too extreme for the everyday person, but it is really an amazing workout. Once you get into the sport, and learn how to position your body and rest your weight, then you can begin to deal with some difficult problems. The great thing about rock climbing is that it is mentally challenging as well. You are constantly analyzing the way your body moves and how to do certain moves on the wall. For anyone who wants to get into shape, rock climbing is a fun and effective way to exercise muscles. Question: _ will make rock climbing easier.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Teacher:In this task, you are given two simple actions (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\"). You must identify which action is considered less ethical. Do not generate anything else apart from one of the following characters: 'A', 'B'. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: (A) saying no to going to formal with someone (B) not wanting to room with my friend Student:","completion":"To solve this problem, I will first analyze both actions and consider how they might impact others. Step 1: Analyze Action A Saying no to going to formal with someone could potentially hurt someone's feelings, but it also allows an individual to set boundaries and make choices based on their comfort level. It's important to be honest about one's feelings and preferences rather than attending an event out of obligation. Step 2: Analyze Action B Not wanting to room with a friend might also hurt their feelings, but it can also be an important decision for personal comfort and maintaining a friendship. Living with someone can be challenging, and if someone feels that they aren't well-suited for living together, it might be better for the friendship to remain separate in terms of living arrangements. Step 3: Compare Actions Both actions may cause some emotional distress, but saying no to going to formal with someone (A) is a single, specific event, while not wanting to room with a friend (B) can have a longer-lasting impact on daily life and relationships. In conclusion, action B (not wanting to room with a friend) is considered less ethical at a first glance, as it might create a more prolonged impact on the friendship and affect the roommate relationship. Thus, the answer is 'B'."},{"prompt":"Process: - An isotope has too many protons - The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"its hit with neutrons\\" happens, how will it affect MORE radioactive decay occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If an unstable isotope is hit with neutrons, it can lead to more radioactive decay occurring depending on the reaction that takes place upon being hit with neutrons. 1. Neutron capture: If the unstable isotope captures the neutron, it will increase the number of neutrons in its nucleus. Depending on the isotope in question, neutron capture can sometimes cause the unstable isotope to become more unstable or even stable. If the resulting isotope after neutron capture is more unstable, this will indirectly lead to more radioactive decay. 2. Neutron-induced fission: In some cases, particularly for heavy and highly unstable isotopes (e.g., Uranium-235), the interaction with a neutron can cause the nucleus to split into smaller nuclei through a process known as fission. This process will directly increase the radioactive decay, as the fission process releases energy in the form of radiation and produces smaller, unstable daughter isotopes. In conclusion, the perturbation of being hit with neutrons can have a direct or indirect effect on the radioactive decay process depending on the reaction that occurs when the neutron interacts with the unstable isotope. This effect could lead to more radioactive decay, less decay, or even stabilization of the isotope. However, the specific outcome would depend on the type of unstable isotope and its properties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Companies are trying to offer an alternative, clean energy from renewable resources that's plentiful and portable. Lifton's Medis Technologies, as well as companies like Hydrogenics and Nanosys, is tapping into fuel cells and dolor panels to give people power whenever and wherever they want it, free from dependence on local grids . The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030. When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces heat and water. Fuel cells use this reaction to generate electricity. With the cell phone and gadget market in mind, Medis has developed a fuel cell with cheap components that produces little heat and effortlessly reduces waste water without turning to energy consuming pumps. The answer to this question is:","completion":"What was one of the main goals of innovators in the search for alternative energy sources in the article?

War of words continues in Trayvon Martin case Key Trayvon Martin evidence enhanced \\"AC360°\\" teams up with a child psychologist to see what factors contribute to children's opinions on race. Could these same factors have shaped how you view race? The special report, \\"Kids on Race: The Hidden Truth,\\" continues Wednesday on CNN at 8 p.m. ET. Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- Supporters of slain teen Trayvon Martin and his acknowledged killer continued Tuesday to battle over the significance of evidence in the case. A Martin family attorney insisted Tuesday that the former prosecutor in the case met with the now sidelined police chief to discuss the case hours after Martin died, overruling a police detective who the family says prepared an affidavit urging that neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman be arrested. Meanwhile, a friend of Zimmerman's told CNN that video of the neighborhood watch volunteer in police custody does seem to show injuries consistent with Zimmerman's report that Martin slammed his head to the concrete after the two exchanged words. FBI agents were in Sanford on Tuesday, continuing their interviews in a civil rights investigation of the case, which Martin family supporters say is a clear-cut case of racial profiling leading to an unjust killing. One of the people they met with Tuesday is Frank Taaffe, Zimmerman's neighbor and friend. On Monday, agents interviewed Martin's girlfriend, the 16-year-old girl who, phone records show, was on the line with him shortly before the fatal confrontation, Martin family attorney Daryl Parks confirmed Tuesday. Special prosecutor Angela Corey's investigation also continued. Martin's family and supporters say Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, profiled Martin, who was black, as \\"suspicious\\" and ignored a police dispatcher's request that he not follow him. Martin had a bag of Skittles and an iced tea at the time of his death. The 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer has said he killed the unarmed 17-year-old in self-defense, saying the teen punched him and slammed his head into a sidewalk before the shooting, according to family members and police. Rallies nationwide have called for Zimmerman's arrest, decrying the Sanford Police Department's handling of the case. Zimmerman's legal adviser, Craig Sonner, said on Tuesday that criminal defense lawyer Hal Uhrig would represent Zimmerman and that Sonner would serve as co-counsel if the case were to proceed. Uhrig spent more than six years with the Gainesville Police Department in Florida before graduating from law school in 1974. In an interview with WOFL-TV in Orlando, both lawyers said they had communicated with Zimmerman only by telephone. Sonner said Zimmerman, who has not appeared publicly since the shooting, was concerned about \\"people who will do him harm.\\" On Tuesday, Martin family attorney Jasmine Rand insisted again that the former prosecutor in the case, State Attorney Norm Wolfinger, met with the now sidelined Sanford police chief on the night of the killing and overruled a police detective urging that Zimmerman be arrested. In a letter delivered Monday to the U.S. Justice Department, the Martin family said the Sanford police detective \\"filed an affidavit stating that he did not find Zimmerman's statements credible in light of the circumstances and facts surrounding the shooting.\\" The Martin family said Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee and State Attorney Norm Wolfinger met the night of the shooting and disregarded the detective's advice, allowing Zimmerman to remain free. ABC News has reported that the lead homicide investigator, Chris Serino, filed an affidavit pushing for charges the night of the killing, but was overruled by the state attorney's office. Neither Sanford police nor prosecutors have confirmed the existence of such an affidavit. Sanford officials and special prosecutor Corey's office declined to comment. On Tuesday, Rand said she had not seen a copy of the affidavit, but said she believed several news organizations had. But Wolfinger, who stepped aside in the case last month, vehemently denied that any \\"such meeting or communication occurred\\" between him and Lee. \\"I am outraged by the outright lies contained in the letter by Benjamin Crump,\\" a Martin family attorney, Wolfinger said in a statement Monday. \\"I have been encouraging those spreading the irresponsible rhetoric to stop and allow State Attorney Angela Corey to complete her work,\\" he said. \\"Another falsehood distributed to the media does nothing to forward that process.\\" Rand said the family's legal team has multiple, credible sources who say Wolfinger and Lee met that night. She declined to elaborate. The two sides also argued Tuesday over surveillance video showing Zimmerman in police custody after the shooting. An enhanced copy of the video appears to show a bump, mark or injury on Zimmerman's head more clearly than does another copy of the video previously reviewed by CNN. That video had a grainy quality. While the video does not appear to show major wounds, Taaffe, Zimmerman's neighbor and friend, said Seminole County paramedics cared for Zimmerman before they released him to police. \\"That's why you don't see him like he came out of a 12-round fight like Rocky Balboa against Apollo Creed,\\" Taaffe said. But Rand, the Martin family attorney, said Tuesday that it doesn't matter what the videotape shows. \\"That does not change our position,\\" she said. \\"Once again, George Zimmerman was the aggressor. He pursued Trayvon in this instance. If he did have any medical injuries, that did not give him the right to use deadly force and shoot and kill Trayvon.\\" Also Tuesday, Taaffe told CNN that the neighborhood had experienced a spate of burglaries over 15 months, which he said were committed by black men. But Taaffe said Zimmerman was not a racist. \\"Young black men were never the topic of discussion,\\" he said. It was that neighborhood homes had been repeatedly burglarized, he said. Police records didn't appear to support Taaffe's assertion, describing four incidents involving black men. Taaffe declined further comment to CNN. The continued discussion over recorded evidence carried over from Monday, when a major point of debate was a 911 call placed on the night Martin was killed. Zimmerman has said he was yelling for help, according to his family members and his account to authorities, as first reported by the Orlando Sentinel and later confirmed by Sanford police. But Martin's relatives, including his cousin Ronquavis Fulton, have said they are certain the voice heard on the 911 call is Trayvon Martin's. Audio experts Tom Owen and Ed Primeau, who analyzed the recordings for the Sentinel using different techniques, said they don't believe it is Zimmerman who is heard yelling in the background of one 911 call. They compared the screams with Zimmerman's voice, as recorded in a 911 call he made minutes earlier describing a \\"suspicious\\" black male. \\"There's a huge chance that this is not Zimmerman's voice,\\" said Primeau, a longtime audio engineer who is listed as an expert in recorded evidence by the American College of Forensic Examiners International. \\"After 28 years of doing this, I would put my reputation on the line and say this is not George Zimmerman screaming.\\" Owen, a forensic audio analyst and chairman emeritus of the American Board of Recorded Evidence, also said he does not believe the screams came from Zimmerman. He cited software that is widely used in Europe and has become recently accepted in the United States that examines characteristics like pitch and the space between spoken words to analyze voices. Using it, he found a 48% likelihood the voice is Zimmerman's. At least 60% is necessary to feel confident two samples are from the same source, he told CNN on Monday -- meaning it's unlikely it was Zimmerman who can be heard yelling. The experts, both of whom said they have testified in cases involving audio analysis, stressed they cannot say who was screaming. But CNN and HLN legal analysts Beth Karas and Sonny Hostin raised questions about what the public should consider regarding the conclusions reached. Hostin said several questions and variables must be considered, including the fact the tests did not analyze similar speech. That is, the analysis was based on screams heard from a distance in a 911 call, compared with a direct phone conversation Zimmerman had with a 911 operator. \\"Ideally, you want (Zimmerman or Martin's) voice saying the same exact thing, screaming 'Help!' in order to analyze it,\\" she said. Would these tests be admissible in court and considered evidence? \\"It really depends on the individual judge,\\" Hostin said. \\"In Florida, they are going to conduct a Frye test, the legal test, which asks if the science is generally accepted in the community.\\" Karas questioned whether the test stood up to the voice-comparison standards of the American Board of Recorded Evidence. The standards indicate that, when analyzing speech, there should be a minimum of at least 10 words to be compared with each other in order to say you can have a \\"possible elimination\\" conclusion. But in this case, the cries for help don't have nearly that number of words. Owen said the published American Board of Recorded Evidence standards apply only partially to the kind of test he conducted. \\"These standards apply to the older aural-spectrographic analysis and software,\\" Owen said. \\"This only partially applies to the biometric software.\\" Both Karas and Hostin urged caution in reaching any conclusions about the findings of Primeau and Owen. \\"I do think we need to take a step back, as with most of the facts in this case, and look at it the way the court would,\\" Hostin said. \\"And that is by asking if the circumstances of how, and if, the test was done, OK, and wait to determine whether it's reliable.\\" The ongoing friction from the incident has continued to divide Sanford and the country. But Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett said Tuesday he senses that people in his community are ready to start trying to move on. \\"I think there's a big portion of the city that are trying to get to the healing mode,\\" he said.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How is \\"Threading Model\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the term \\"Threading Model\\" can be translated as \\"Vláknový Model\\". It's essential to understand the concept and application of threading models in computing and software development. A vláknový model (threading model) is a concept that refers to the management and utilization of multiple threads within a software application or process. Threads are the smallest unit of execution within a program, and they describe how tasks are divided and managed by the operating system or software. Threading models are critical components in any programming language or platform, as they determine how concurrent operations will be performed and managed effectively. There are several types of threading models used in various programming languages and platforms. Some of the most common ones include: 1. Jednovláknový model (single-threaded model): In this model, the application or process is executed linearly, with only one thread running at a time. This is the most straightforward approach to managing execution flow, but it can lead to performance issues, especially when dealing with tasks that require waiting for external resources, such as input/output operations or network communication. 2. Vícevláknový model (multi-threaded model): In this model, multiple threads run concurrently, allowing tasks to be processed in parallel. It helps improve the performance and responsiveness of an application, as threads can work on tasks independently and continue processing even when one of the threads has to wait for an external interaction. This can make the application more efficient, but it may also require more advanced synchronization and communication mechanisms between threads, such as mutexes, locks, or semaphores. 3. Paralelní model (parallel model): This model is a more advanced variation of the multi-threaded model, specifically designed for high-performance computing and optimization on modern hardware systems with multiple CPU cores or processors. It involves running multiple threads in parallel and effectively managing resources like CPU cores and memory to minimize potential bottlenecks or conflicts. 4. Asynchronní model (asynchronous model): This threading model focuses on performing tasks without blocking the execution of other tasks or threads. In an asynchronous model, multiple tasks run in parallel, and synchronization mechanisms like callbacks, promises, or event-driven systems are used to handle tasks' completion or communication between them. It helps improve the responsiveness and overall performance of an application, especially when dealing with time-consuming operations such as network communication or user interactions. Understanding and applying the appropriate threading model in Czech (vláknový model) is essential for developing efficient, scalable, and reliable software applications that can perform well on different hardware and operating systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the topic that this about: The service is the latest in a portfolio of businesses under the Easy banner, including easyJet, easyInternetcafe, easyCinema, easyBus, easyPizza, easyCar and easy4Men.","completion":"The topic of this discussion is about the brand EasyGroup and the variety of services and businesses it encompasses under its umbrella, such as easyJet, easyInternetcafe, easyCinema, easyBus, easyPizza, easyCar, and easy4Men. EasyGroup was founded by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, a British-Cypriot entrepreneur, in 1998. The brand is known for its distinct orange hue and simplified business models, targeting budget-conscious consumers. 1. easyJet: Launched in 1995, easyJet is now one of Europe's leading low-cost airlines. Serving over 150 destinations across Europe, the Middle East, and Northern Africa, easyJet's primary focus is to provide affordable air travel for the masses. EasyJet operates using a no-frills business model, with passengers paying extra fees for checked luggage, seat selection, and in-flight food and beverages. This cost-effective approach allows easyJet to maintain competitive prices while ensuring operational efficiency. 2. easyInternetcafe: First opened in London in 1999, at the peak of the internet cafe boom, easyInternetcafe was Europe's largest chain of internet cafes. EasyInternetcafe offered affordable internet access, charging customers on a per-minute basis. With the advent and widespread adoption of smartphones, easyInternetcafe has declined in popularity, but it remains an example of the brand's innovative approach to providing accessible technology for the masses. 3. easyCinema: Launched in 2003, easyCinema aimed to revolutionize the theater-going experience by adopting a dynamic pricing model, where tickets were cheaper earlier in the day and more expensive closer to the showtime. This business model aimed to attract price-sensitive consumers to watch movies during off-peak times. However, the idea struggled to gain traction and faced resistance from film distributors, leading to the closure of easyCinema's flagship location in 2006. 4. easyBus: Established in 2004, easyBus is a low-cost, airport transfer bus service primarily operating in London. It offers regular transfer services between several key airports and central London, providing an affordable and convenient transportation option for budget-conscious travelers. EasyBus is particularly popular among users of the easyJet airline, as it complements the airline's goal of affordable air travel. 5. easyPizza: Founded in 2004, easyPizza was an online pizza delivery service targeting budget-conscious consumers. Pizzas were available at significantly lower prices compared to competitors, with customers pre-booking delivery time slots. However, due to operational challenges and limited public acceptance, the venture was short-lived, with easyPizza changing its name to easyFoodstore and shifting focus to selling low-cost, non-perishable groceries in 2016. 6. easyCar: Launched in 2000, easyCar is a car rental service with a focus on low-cost pricing and a streamlined booking system. With convenient pickup and drop-off locations across various destinations, easyCar makes car rental options more accessible for price-conscious travelers. 7. easy4Men: Introduced in 2001, easy4Men was a budget retail venture that aimed to sell men's toiletries and grooming products at discounted prices. However, like some other EasyGroup ventures, it failed to gain widespread popularity and eventually closed. EasyGroup's businesses are united under a common goal of making products and services more accessible for consumers through simplified business models, low-cost pricing, and innovative solutions. While not all ventures have been successful, the company's impact on various industries, particularly the travel sector, has been significant. By constantly adapting and addressing market needs, EasyGroup remains at the forefront of innovation in making essential services more affordable for people across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? it 's a thin notion","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the movie review sentence, \\"it's a thin notion,\\" we must first understand the meaning conveyed by the author and its context within the overall review. However, given this single sentence, we will analyze and interpret it as thoroughly as possible. The phrase \\"thin notion\\" suggests that the movie concept is not complex, lacks depth, or is superficial. In general, movie reviews use such expressions to describe a poorly constructed or uninspired story premise. The author's choice of the word \\"thin\\" implies that they might find the idea weak, as opposed to \\"thick\\" or \\"rich,\\" which would denote a stronger, more engaging concept. Considering the given context, the sentiment of this sentence appears to be negative. However, it is essential to note that this analysis is based solely on this single sentence. The sentiment might be different when the entire review is read, as it could offer a more balanced assessment of the movie or further context on the author's perspective. In conclusion, based on the given sentence, \\"it's a thin notion,\\" the sentiment leans towards negative, as it conveys that the movie has a weak, superficial, or underdeveloped concept.

Is At their outset in the early 1970s, Queen's music has been characterised as \\"Led Zeppelin meets Yes\\" due to its combination of \\"acoustic/electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics\\". a good answer to this question?","completion":"While the statement \\"Led Zeppelin meets Yes\\" provides an insight into Queen's musical influences and style, it does not specifically answer the question about which guitarist inspired Queen. A more detailed and long response is needed to address the question properly. It is essential to note that Queen is comprised of various members, each with their individual musical influences and tastes, which all contributed to the band's unique sound. In the context of Queen's formation and the guitarist who may have inspired the group, it is crucial to focus on Queen's lead guitarist, Brian May. Brian May, born on July 19, 1947, in Hampton, London, was a significant driving force in Queen's distinct sound and an innovative guitarist in his own right. His influences and sources of inspiration were varied and included musicians from both the blues and rock genres. One of the most important guitarists that had a considerable impact on Brian May's playing style and sound was Jimi Hendrix. Brian May has highlighted Hendrix's influence on him several times over the years. He admired Hendrix's musical abilities, innovative use of feedback and distortion, and the emotion he was able to express through his guitar playing. Another prominent guitarist who likely had an impact on both May's guitar style and the band's overall sound was Eric Clapton. Clapton's work with the bands Cream, and Derek and the Dominos showcased disciplined soloing and remarkable vibrato, qualities May later adopted into his own playing. Also, British guitarist Jeff Beck had a profound influence on May, as he expressed in several interviews. Beck's experimentation with guitar sounds, his impressive technical abilities, and versatility have long been a source of inspiration for May. Lastly, we cannot overlook May's inspiration from other bands and guitarists that emerged during the 1960s and early 1970s. Queen's sound indeed combines the hard-rocking, blues-infused elements of bands like Led Zeppelin with the progressive, symphonic sensibilities of groups like Yes. Consequently, guitarists like Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin and Steve Howe from Yes would have also played a role in shaping Queen's guitar sound. In summary, Queen's music was undoubtedly inspired by several guitarists and bands from the 1960s and early 1970s. The lead guitarist, Brian May, has mentioned multiple influences in his playing, including Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and other guitarists from contemporary groups like Led Zeppelin and Yes. The combination of these various influences formed the foundation for Queen's unique, iconic sound that remains celebrated to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march.

Q:Information: - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude. - Slapstick is a style of humor involving exaggerated physical activity which exceeds the boundaries of normal physical comedy. The term arises from a device developed during the broad, physical comedy style known as Commedia dell'arte in 16th Century Italy. The 'slap stick' consists of two thin slats of wood made from splitting a single long stick, which make a 'slap' when striking another actor, with little force needed to make a loud - and comical - sound. - Etiology (alternatively aetiology or ætiology) is the study of causation, or origination. The word is derived from the Greek , \\"aitiologia\\", \\"giving a reason for\\" (\\"aitia\\", \\"cause\\"; and , \\"-logia\\"). The word is most commonly used in medical and philosophical theories, where it is used to refer to the study of why things occur, or even the reasons behind the way that things act, and is used in philosophy, physics, psychology, government, geography, spatial analysis, medicine, theology, and biology in reference to the causes of various phenomena. - Premature ejaculation (PE) occurs when a man experiences orgasm and expels semen soon after sexual activity and with minimal penile stimulation. It has also been called \\"early ejaculation,\\" \\"rapid ejaculation,\\" \\"rapid climax,\\" \\"premature climax,\\" and (historically) \\"ejaculatio praecox.\\" There is no uniform cut-off defining \\"premature\\", but a consensus of experts at the International Society for Sexual Medicine endorsed a definition including \\"ejaculation which always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about one minute\\". The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) applies a cut-off of 15 seconds from the beginning of sexual intercourse. - \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\" is a famous phrase typically featured on the American sketch comedy show \\"Saturday Night Live\\", which runs on the NBC broadcast network. It is generally used as a way to end a cold opening sketch and lead into the opening titles/montage and cast introductions for the program. - A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh. This might be through jokes or amusing situations, or acting a fool, as in slapstick, or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comic. - Saturday Night Live (abbreviated as SNL) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\", properly beginning the show. - Duncan \\"Dick\\" Ebersol (born July 28, 1947) is an American television executive and a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports & Olympics.

It was directed by Reginald Hudlin . The movie focuses on the exploits of radio host and sex therapy expert Leon Phelps . - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - Sex therapy is a strategy for the treatment of sexual dysfunction when there is no medical etiology (physiological reason) or as a complement to medical treatment. The sexual dysfunctions which may be addressed by sex therapy include non-consummation, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, low libido, unwanted sexual fetishes, sexual addiction, painful sex, or a lack of sexual confidence, assisting people who are recovering from sexual assault, problems commonly caused by stress, tiredness, and other environmental and relationship factors. Sex therapists assist those experiencing problems in overcoming them, in doing so possibly regaining an active sex life. - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center.

He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions. Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who warned that jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam?\\" is \\"Jahiliyya\\"? OPTIONS: --no. --yes.","completion":"No. According to the above paragraph, it is Sayyid Qutb who warned that jahiliyya could triumph over Islam. Qutb was an influential Egyptian writer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He believed that the world was divided into Islam and jahiliyya, a condition of ignorance and unbelief. He warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to the material comforts of jahiliyya than to his view of Islam, and as a result, it could potentially triumph over Islam. Osama bin Laden was heavily influenced by Qutb's views which ultimately shaped his own extremist ideologies."},{"prompt":"\\"Clemson Area Transit\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Went straight from a facility that deals with homeless children (492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York) to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport about 20 miles away. It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home. I don’t even know the names of those I’m relegated to living with. The unnerving strangeness and disorientation hat comes with knowing that your life has changed and the culture shock that comes with that is so scary and desensitizes you on that first day.

Please answer a question about the following article about Queen Victoria: According to one of her biographers, Giles St Aubyn, Victoria wrote an average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life. From July 1832 until just before her death, she kept a detailed journal, which eventually encompassed 122 volumes. After Victoria's death, her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was appointed her literary executor. Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process. Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them. Part of Victoria's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C. Benson, Hector Bolitho, George Earle Buckle, Lord Esher, Roger Fulford, and Richard Hough among others. How many volumes was Queen Victorias journal?","completion":"Queen Victoria's journal encompassed a total of 122 volumes. These detailed journals were maintained from July 1832 until just before her death.

The eight months of bombing never seriously hampered British production and the war industries continued to operate and expand. The Blitz was only authorised when the Luftwaffe had failed to meet preconditions for a 1940 launch of Operation Sea Lion, the provisionally planned German invasion of Britain. By May 1941 the threat of an invasion of Britain had passed, and Hitler's attention had turned to Operation Barbarossa in the East. In comparison to the later Allied bombing campaign against Germany, the Blitz resulted in relatively few casualties; the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 inflicted some 42,000 civilian deaths, about the same as the entire Blitz.\\", answer the following question.
