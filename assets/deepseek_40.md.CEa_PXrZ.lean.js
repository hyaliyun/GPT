Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Information: - An epitope, also known as antigenic determinant, is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system, specifically by antibodies, B cells, or T cells. For example, the epitope is the specific piece of the antigen to which an antibody binds. The part of an antibody that binds to the epitope is called a paratope. Although epitopes are usually non-self proteins, sequences derived from the host that can be recognized (as in the case of autoimmune diseases) are also epitopes. - A phosphoprotein is a protein that is posttranslationally modified by the attachment of either a single phosphate group, or a complex molecule such as 5'-phospho-DNA, through a phosphate group. The target amino acid is usually serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues (mostly in eukaryotes), or aspartic acid or histidine residues (mostly in prokaryotes). - In immunology, an antigen is a molecule capable of inducing an immune response on the part of the host organism, though sometimes antigens can be part of the host itself. In other words, an antigen is any substance that causes an immune system to produce antibodies against it. Each antibody is specifically produced by the immune system to match an antigen after cells in the immune system come into contact with it; this allows a precise identification of the antigen and the initiation of a tailored response. The antibody is said to \\"match\\" the antigen in the sense that it can bind to it thanks to adaptations performed to a region of the antibody; because of this, many different antibodies can be produced, with specificity to bind many different antigens while sharing the same basic structure. In most cases, an antibody can only bind one specific antigen; in some instances, however, antibodies may bind more than one antigen. - Leukemia, also spelled leukaemia, is a group of cancers that usually begin in the bone marrow and result in high numbers of abnormal white blood cells. These white blood cells are not fully developed and are called \\"blasts\\" or \\"leukemia cells\\". Symptoms may include bleeding and bruising problems, feeling tired, fever, and an increased risk of infections. These symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells. Diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy. The exact cause of leukemia is unknown. Different kinds of leukemia are believed to have different causes. Both inherited and environmental (non-inherited) factors are believed to be involved. Risk factors include smoking, ionizing radiation, some chemicals (such as benzene), prior chemotherapy, and Down syndrome. People with a family history of leukemia are also at higher risk. There are four main types of leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as well as a number of less common types. Leukemias and lymphomas both belong to a broader group of tumors that affect the blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid system, known as tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Treatment may involve some combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and bone marrow transplant, in addition to supportive care and palliative care as needed. Certain types of leukemia may be managed with watchful waiting. The success of treatment depends on the type of leukemia and the age of the person. Outcomes have improved in the developed world. The average five-year survival rate is 57% in the United States. In children under 15, the five-year survival rate is greater than 60 to 85%, depending on the type of leukemia. In children with acute leukemia who are cancer-free after five years, the cancer is unlikely to return. In 2012, leukemia developed in 352,000 people globally and caused 265,000 deaths. It is the most common type of cancer in... - Benzene is an important organic chemical compound with the chemical formula CH. The benzene molecule is composed of 6 carbon atoms joined in a ring with 1 hydrogen atom attached to each. Because it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon. - B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 or CD20 is an activated-glycosylated phosphoprotein expressed on the surface of all B-cells beginning at the pro-B phase (CD45R+, CD117+) and progressively increasing in concentration until maturity. - Polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) are antibodies that are secreted by different B cell lineages within the body (whereas monoclonal antibodies come from a single cell lineage). They are a collection of immunoglobulin molecules that react against a specific antigen, each identifying a different epitope. - Plasma cells, also called plasma B cells, plasmocytes, plasmacytes, or effector B cells, are white blood cells that secrete large volumes of antibodies. They are transported by the blood plasma and the lymphatic system. Plasma cells originate in the bone marrow; B cells differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibody molecules closely modeled after the receptors of the precursor B cell. Once released into the blood and lymph, these antibody molecules bind to the target antigen (foreign substance) and initiate its neutralization or destruction. - Rituximab ( trade names Rituxan , MabThera and Zytux ) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the protein CD20 , which is primarily found on the surface of immune system B cells . Rituximab destroys B cells and is therefore used to treat diseases which are characterized by excessive numbers of B cells , overactive B cells , or dysfunctional B cells . This includes many lymphomas , leukemias , transplant rejection , and autoimmune disorders . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the most important medications needed in a basic health system . It has a wholesale price of between 159.00 and 2,480.00 USD per vial as of 2014 . - Monoclonal antibodies (mAb or moAb) are antibodies that are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. Monoclonal antibodies can have monovalent affinity, in that they bind to the same epitope (the part of an antigen that is recognized by the antibody). In contrast, polyclonal antibodies bind to multiple epitopes and are usually made by several different plasma cell (antibody secreting immune cell) lineages. Bispecific monoclonal antibodies can also be engineered, by increasing the therapeutic targets of one single monoclonal antibody to two epitopes. - Mast/stem cell growth factor receptor (SCFR), also known as proto-oncogene c-Kit or tyrosine-protein kinase Kit or CD117, is a receptor tyrosine kinase protein that in humans is encoded by the KIT gene. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. KIT was first described by the German biochemist Axel Ullrich in 1987 as the cellular homolog of the feline sarcoma viral oncogene v-kit.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Sometimes you need to make phone calls to get a job. Calling is the first step where you can show your ability to an employer. Here are some tried and true tips: Get the person responsible You need to talk directly to the person who would supervise you. In a small business, you might ask to speak to the \\"person in charge\\". In a larger one, you would ask for the name of the person in charge of the particular department you're interested in. Get the name of the person If you don't have the name of the person you need to speak to, ask for it. Usually, you will be given the supervisor's name and your call will be transferred to him or her. Get past the receptionist In some cases, receptionists and secretaries will try to screen out your call. If they find out that you're looking for a job, they may transfer you to the Personnel Department or ask you to send an application or resume. Here are some ways to keep from getting screened out: * Call back Call back a day later and say you are getting ready to send some correspondence to the person who manages such and such. You want to use the correct name and title and request that they give you this information. And this approach usually gets you what you need. Say \\"thank you\\" and call back in a day or so. Then ask for the supervisor or manager by name. * Call when the secretary is out You are likely to get right through if you call when the receptionist is out to lunch. Other good times are just before and after normal work hours. Less experienced staff members are likely to answer the phone and put you right through. Ask three times for an interview Sometimes, the supervisor you contact just simply rejects you. Then, you can try asking three times for an interview! Although this approach does not always work, asking the third time works more often than most people would believe. Arrange a time If the person agrees to an interview, arrange a specific date and time.

Asking for the supervisor's name before talking and calling when the secretary is likely to be out. B. Calling during the busiest hours to show persistence. C. Talking directly to the receptionist or secretary and explaining in detail why you are interested in the job. D. Directly asking for an interview in your first call and arranging the date and time. Correct answer: A. Asking for the supervisor's name before talking and calling when the secretary is likely to be out. This strategy is recommended as it helps to bypass receptionists or secretaries who might screen out the call, ensures that you're speaking directly to the person responsible for the role, and increases the chances of proceeding with the necessary steps for employment.

Context: The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the levels of vasoactive eicosanoid hormone-like substances PGE2, PGI2 and TXA2 in hemodialysis (HD)patients who were following a long-term physical training program during the hemodialysis session.', 'A total of 50 patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (stage 5)on hemodialysis and 35 healthy individuals who served as controls (C) were evaluated. The 50 CKD patients were divided into two groups: the HD group consisted of 31 patients who received usual care without any physical activity during the hemodialysis sessions, while group HD/Exer included 19 patients who followed a program of physical exercise for six months. Plasma levels of PGE2, 6-Keto-PGF1alpha (the stable derivative of PGI2) and TXB2 (the stable derivative of TXA2) were measured by reliable enzymo-immunoassay methods (EIA) in HD and HD/Exer patients before and after the hemodialysis sessions as well as in the group of C.', 'The plasma levels of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha in group HD Exer/before patients were higher than those in group HDbefore (20.39+/-5.82 and 1449.19+/-553.41 vs 17.68+/-5.36 and 1295.10+/-384.43 pg/ml, p=0.044 and p=0.067, respectively), while the plasma levels of TXB2 were lower in HD Exer/before patients compared to HDbefore(499.76+/-67.51 vs 608.01+/-80.23 pg/ml, p=0.041). The plasma levels of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha in group HD Exer/after patients were significantly higher compared to those in HDafter patients (23.01+/-5.70 and 1618.19+/-435.07 vs 16.57+/-4.97 and 1005.44+/-317.16 pg/ml, p<0.001 and p<0.040, respectively). However, significantly lower values in the plasma levels of TXB2 in HD Exer/after compared to HDafter patients (363.10+/-51.91 vs 439.75+/-62.34 pg/ml, p=0.030) were detected. As expected, PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1alpha values were lower in C than in the groups of patients with CKD.Question: Does physical training in patients on hemodialysis have a beneficial effect on the levels of eicosanoid hormone-like substances?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The west is letting Putin get his way on Ukraine Ukraine’s new parliament was sworn in today. More than 400 members took their oaths, but 27 seats remain vacant – the annexation of Crimea, plus the war in eastern Ukraine, prevented deputies being elected there. It is just one year since people seeking democracy and prosperity began protesting in Kiev’s Maidan Square, leading to the downfall of a kleptocratic regime and descent of a new cold war in Europe. How rapidly the news agenda moves on. Crimea was the first annexation on the continent since 1945 but is now largely forgotten, despite prices soaring and people disappearing or dying in suspicious circumstances if they cross their new rulers. Human Rights Watch has catalogued the import of Vladimir Putin’s trademark tactics of abusing activists and harassing journalists. Meanwhile, a crippling conflict drags on in Europe. More than 4,300 combatants and civilians have been killed since Russia and its stooges began stirring up trouble eight months ago. Almost a million people have fled the afflicted region, the numbers surging in recent weeks. A report by UN monitors disclosed an average of 13 people dying each day since a supposed ceasefire between Ukraine, Russia and the rebels in early September, while all the protagonists suffer painful economic fallout. So what’s being done? The message from last week’s G20 summit seemed clear: Putin was being sent to diplomatic Siberia. Stephen Harper, Canada’s prime minister, told the Russian president he would shake his hand but had only one thing to say: “You need to get out of Ukraine.” Then Putin was subjected to snubs, shunned at lunch and berated by other world leaders; little surprise he fled home early. Few will shed tears over such treatment of a despotic figure doing such damage to his nation’s interests both at home and abroad. But this was gesture politics of the worst kind from western leaders, posturing in public while seeming to have little strategy for how to resolve a spiralling crisis in the midst of Europe. Instead, Ukraine seems to be slipping down the foreign policy agenda. In the summer I saw early skirmishes at Donetsk airport, given a £500m facelift before football’s European Championship two years ago. Ukraine and the Russian rebels remain locked in lethal combat over the abandoned planes, wrecked control tower and battered terminal buildings, much of the debris filled with booby traps after the two sides slugged it out from different floors. Now a place that so recently demonstrated national pride is a depressing symbol of this destructive struggle. Not only has Putin got his hands on Crimea, but increasingly it appears he may be getting what he wants elsewhere in Ukraine too, with the destabilising of a fledgling democracy and creation of patsy states on his border. For as Kiev halts payments of public funds for Novorossiya (New Russia), the areas of Donbass controlled by rebels seem to be sliding into frozen statehood. This is another favoured Kremlin tactic – as seen with Russian-backed splinter states such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia, and Transnistria in Moldova. Novorossiya would, however, be much more costly to support, with the need to rebuild a shattered, heavily industrialised pariah state of 4 million people. It reveals how Putin is at the mercy of events as much as any other player in the region, trapped by the potent combination of soaring popularity and a shaky economy. Yet only the most deluded or sycophantic observer can blame anyone but Putin for these tragic scenes. For all his postmodern pretence of non-involvement, Russia’s president sent his forces into a neighbouring nation, tearing apart a country whose people sought the freedom and accountability he so fears in his own nation. Ukraine’s attempts to recapture its territory were thwarted by troops, tanks and artillery from over the border. The response of western leaders is to pose as tough guys on the public stage while preparing to impose a few minor sanctions on separatists and some Putin cronies. They hope that pressure on Russia’s economy will prevent further escalation, although this might make Putin even more unpredictable. Meanwhile, Moscow continues to ramp up military spending, just as it has done from the moment that Putin, this former KGB apparatchik with Tsarist ambitions, took office – while the Baltic states (members of Nato, remember) grow ever more anxious. Solutions should come from diplomatic, not military, action. Yet there must be deterrence alongside diplomacy. There is a danger, however, that the west is so distracted by events in the Middle East that it ignores the angry Russian bear lashing out in Europe, which possibly poses the bigger threat to our immediate futures. Earlier this year the Russian activist Alexei Navalny proposed a list of Putin’s inner circle who should be subjected to sanctions; nearly all are now on the western blacklist, apart from the football oligarchs Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov. It would send a powerful signal to see sanctions imposed on this pair, whatever the cost to their London clubs. Moscow is also demanding guarantees that Ukraine will never be allowed to join Nato; but Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s president, insisted this week that his nation will hold a vote once it meets the criteria for membership. Such a move should be welcomed if sought by the populace, as should their desire to join the EU. For at the core of this crisis lies the basic principle behind our noblest European ideals: the democratic right of people to determine their own futures, rather than have such hopes crushed by despotism or foreign aggressors. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The text talks about how Putin, the leader of Russia, is causing problems in Ukraine. Ukraine's new parliament members are being sworn in, but there are some empty seats because people from some areas couldn't vote. This is because Russia took control of Crimea and is causing trouble in eastern Ukraine. Many people have been killed or have had to leave their homes because of the fighting. Meanwhile, western leaders, like those from the United States and Europe, are not doing enough to solve the problem. They have imposed some penalties on Russia, but it might not be enough. The text suggests that more needs to be done to protect and support Ukraine's right to make decisions for itself, instead of having a big, powerful neighbor like Russia control them."},{"prompt":"Question: This article: Hachijō-daiko (八丈太鼓, trans. \\"Hachijō-style taiko\\") is a taiko tradition originating on the island of Hachijō-jima. Two styles of Hachijō-daiko emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.The Hachijō-daiko tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named Kakuso Kizan. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as \\"a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around\\", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of Hachijō-daiko. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one. The first style of Hachijō-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the shita-byōshi (下拍子, \\"lower beat\\"), provides the underlying beat.

Context: Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975. By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants. A:","completion":"Portugal once controlled countries such as Angola, Mozambique, and Macau.

Many compound materials exhibit polymorphism, that is they can exist in different structures called polymorphs. Silicon carbide (SiC) is unique in this regard as more than 250 polymorphs of silicon carbide had been identified by 2006, with some of them having a lattice constant as long as 301.5 nm, about one thousand times the usual SiC lattice spacings.

Information: - Herbaceous plants (in botanical use frequently simply herbs) are plants that have no persistent woody stem above ground. Herbaceous plants may be annuals, biennials or perennials. - Patagonia is a sparsely populated region located at the southern end of South America, shared by Argentina and Chile. The region comprises the southern section of the Andes mountains as well as the deserts, steppes and grasslands east of this southern portion of the Andes. Patagonia has two coasts; a western one towards the Pacific Ocean and an eastern one towards the Atlantic Ocean. - Halophytum ameghinoi is a species of herbaceous plant endemic to Patagonia . It is a succulent annual plant , with simple , fleshy , alternate leaves . The plants are monoecious , with solitary female flowers and inflorescences of male flowers on the same plant . Halophytum has sometimes been placed in its own family , Halophytaceae . For instance , the 2009 APG III system and the 2003 APG II system recognise the family and assign it to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots , although the 1998 APG system did not recognise such a family , placing its members in the family Chenopodiaceae instead . - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - In botany, blossoms are the flowers of stone fruit trees (genus \\"Prunus\\") and of some other plants with a similar appearance that flower profusely for a period of time in spring.

A mother is suing her disabled daughter's carers after her wheelchair rolled 200ft down a steep hill and crashed into a main road. Lisa Conisbee, 27, who suffers from cerebral palsy, received horrific facial injuries after her chair rolled down the hill before hitting a kerb and throwing her into the road. Two carers had pushed her to the top of Skinners Hill, in Rushden, Northamptonshire, where they waited for a bus while out on a day trip. It is believed the brakes on her wheelchair may not have been applied as they were waiting, allowing it to roll down the steep incline. Her mother Penny Nadal, 53, is now taking legal action against Olympus Care Services - claiming her daughter’s carers forgot to apply the brakes to the wheelchair. Ms Conisbee - who was left with a scar above her eye and several cuts and bruises to her face - took two months to recover after the fall on April 23 last year. Yesterday, her teaching assistant mother said her daughter, who also suffers from spinal problems, epilepsy and partial blindness, was 'lucky to be alive'. She said: 'To say I am absolutely appalled and angry is an understatement. 'My daughter was placed in the carers’ hands to be looked after and you have to have an understanding of trust.

'Trust has to be earned with my daughter and she always felt safe in her wheelchair but this incident has left her traumatised. Before: Lisa in a picture taken three years ago, before her accident. She lives in a specially adapted bungalow with 24 hour care. 'If a vehicle had been coming the other way she could have been killed. 'I don’t believe the brakes could have been applied, otherwise she would never have rolled down the hill. 'Since the accident she has been very quiet and subdued and is nowhere near as happy as she used to be. 'She has even said things like \\"don’t let them tip me out\\" when getting in her wheelchair. 'It is just awful. I just think that somebody has to be held accountable.' Ms Conisbee lives with other people in a specially adapted bungalow in Wellingborough with 24-hour care. Ms Nadal, who has two other daughters Kerry, 29, and Leanne, 22, lives nearby with her husband Marc, 56.

'Lisa has suffered enough through life as she has battled through various disabilities and learning difficulties.

What was unexpected, however, was that she played herself herself. Her life, after all, has given her the kind of experience and insight that make “Scared Straight” so effective — she can really speak to the effects of a life of crime. There are real, horrible consequences. Like “rehab in Malibu!” “Scared Straight” is one of the most formulaic sketches on the show, which usually makes it pretty successful: the Scared Straight team is introduced in the same way and from there it’s just an opportunity to make as many prison rape jokes as possible. Lohan started out quite funny, but was obviously reading from the teleprompter halfway through the sketch, and stumbled over a few of her lines. It would have been great to see a more polished performance from her, but it didn’t matter, because after she left the scene Jason Sudeikis sat down emphatically on his desk, knocking off the contents (as well as his glasses) and he, Andy Samberg, Bill Hader and Bobby Moynihan collapsed into giggles.

Lohan herself was mostly pushed to the background for the show, usually appearing in unchallenging supporting roles in sketches. The show winked at Lohan’s history of legal troubles in the monologue — Lohan got a pat-down from Kristen Wiig — and in a new “Scared Straight” sketch, in which Lohan played herself. (In that sketch, Lohan’s dependency on cue cards became excruciatingly clear during a long soliloquy.) A visiting Jon Hamm was officially named the night’s back-up host, and the Mad Men star arguably got a bigger laugh for his brief appearance as Snooki’s baby daddy than Lohan got all night.

(NBC/DANA EDELSON/NBC) Lindsay Lohan attempted to make a triumphant return to non-court-hearing-related pop cultural relevancy by hosting “Saturday Night Live” this week. Did it work? Well, not entirely. Lohan started strong with an opening monologue that openly acknowledged her recent circumstances, complete with an alarm that sounded when she stepped offstage, a patdown from Kristen Wiig and a promise from Jon Hamm to step in as host the minute she crashed and burned. The first taped sketch, “Real Housewives of Disney” — which featured Belle, Cinderella, Snow White, Rapunzel and Jasmine acting like Camille Grammer and NeNe Leakes — also worked well, and was a nice dig at Lohan’s roots as Disney golden girl. Then things went a tad south. The prison sketch that added Lohan to the usual Kenan Thompson “Scared Straight” proceedings presented an opportunity for her to fire off a self-reverential monologue — one that mentioned her role in “Herbie: Fully Loaded” and the accusations she faced regarding stolen jewelry. But Lohan, who kept glancing at her cue cards, delivered her lines with a lack of conviction. That ball got definitively dropped. In other sketches — most notably, the a.m. DJ riff and a housesitting bit she did with a decidedly paranoid, butt-dialing Kristen Wiig — were a little better. But Lohan had notably less dialogue to deliver in those sketches and was largely carried by her co-stars. In essence, this was hardly a disaster on par with, say, Lana Del Rey. But Lohan also didn’t fully reclaim her status as a young comic performer worthy of casting in major Hollywood projects. But what did you think?

As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him bewailing their loss.

Continue the following story. When getting married, the bride choose the vanilla cake over the chocolate. She thinks the Choices: - vanilla tastes cheap.; - chocolate tastes cheap.;","completion":"When getting married, the bride chose the vanilla cake over the chocolate, as she believed that the chocolate tasted cheap. The decision had been made after much contemplation, as everyone knew the bride was an ardent chocolate lover. So, it naturally came as a surprise when she decided to break with tradition and opt for a vanilla cake. The wedding preparations were well underway, and every detail was being carefully planned, from the extravagant decorations down to the scrumptious menu. Among various opinions, tastes and preferences, choosing the right cake flavor turned out to be one of the most fiercely debated subjects. However, the bride had her reasons to pick vanilla, and she eventually laid her case as to why chocolate can taste cheap. First, she argued that many chocolate cakes often use subpar or low-quality chocolate. The quality of cocoa and other ingredients can greatly impact the taste of the final product. Choosing a high-quality chocolate for the cake can sometimes be challenging, and the difference is noticeable in taste. She feared that settling for a low-quality chocolate cake would leave her and her guests underwhelmed on the big day. Secondly, she explained that when it comes to wedding cakes, pastry chefs and bakers often prioritize design and stability, which means that they might end up sacrificing some of the flavor in the process. A good chocolate cake is moist and rich, but sometimes, in order to design a cake that can support its beautiful decorations and multiple layers, the baker might make the cake drier or denser than desired. This, in turn, can affect the overall taste and texture of the chocolate cake. Next, she maintained that chocolate as a flavor can be overpowering. While it is undeniably a crowd favorite, chocolate in its many forms can easily overshadow the other delicate flavors served at the wedding. The bride, being a food connoisseur, wanted everyone to savor each dish on the menu, and she worried that having a chocolate wedding cake might dull their taste buds. Finally, she reasoned that choosing a vanilla cake would cater to a wider audience, including those who might not prefer chocolate. A well-made vanilla cake is versatile, delicate, and pairs well with various frostings, fillings, and beverage pairings. This would make it an ideal choice for all guests, respecting their diverse tastes and preferences. As time passed and the wedding date approached, the bride sought out the best bakery in town for her dream vanilla cake. After trying countless samples, she settled on a multi-layered, vanilla masterpiece. Delightfully moist, fragranced with the finest Madagascar vanilla beans, and adorned with a smooth, buttercream frosting – the cake was an ode to the sophistication and elegance that encapsulated her special day. At the wedding reception, the vanilla cake was unveiled to the awe of everyone present. Amid delicate floral arrangements and other tantalizing desserts, it emerged as the centerpiece of a lavish, tasteful spread. As everyone took their first bite, the bride couldn't help but notice the look of pure, unadulterated joy on their faces – even the staunchest chocolate aficionados couldn't resist its charm!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - You place aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins - Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate - The ingots can now be turned into new aluminum products. Question: suppose more water molecules split into oxygen happens, how will it affect LESS aluminum cans being recycled. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"A scenario where more water molecules split into oxygen is unlikely to have a direct effect on the recycling of aluminum cans. The process of recycling aluminum cans, as described above, does not involve the separation of water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen. Aluminum recycling primarily involves the collection, sorting, and melting of aluminum products to produce new aluminum materials. However, if we consider a hypothetical situation where more water molecules split into oxygen, there might be potential indirect effects on the aluminum recycling rate. One possible consequence of increased oxygen levels could be changes to the atmospheric composition and related environmental factors or chemical reactions. This could, in turn, influence the demand for or production of aluminum products. For instance, higher oxygen levels could lead to an increase in oxidation and corrosion, affecting the lifespan of certain metal products, including aluminum. This could subsequently result in a higher demand for aluminum materials and a higher rate of aluminum can production. Conversely, if the increased oxygen levels lead to changes in industrial production processes or the development of alternative materials that replace aluminum, it could lead to a decrease in demand for aluminum products and result in less aluminum cans being recycled. Additionally, if increased oxygen levels lead to more public awareness about environmental issues and sustainability, this could influence society's habits and attitude towards recycling. In this case, people might be more inclined to recycle aluminum cans, potentially leading to an increase in aluminum recycling. On the other hand, increased concern for the environment could also result in more strict regulatory measures, which could potentially limit the production and use of aluminum products, consequently leading to less aluminum cans being recycled. In conclusion, while there might not be a direct correlation between more water molecules splitting into oxygen and the recycling of aluminum cans, potential indirect effects could exist due to changes in environmental conditions, industrial production processes, materials demand, or societal habits. These indirect effects may either result in more, less, or no significant change to the recycling of aluminum cans, depending on how the underlying factors are influenced by the hypothetical perturbation to oxygen levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

NASA, the American space agency, has developed a machine that \\"prints\\" food. They showed a model of the printer in Austin, Texas last month. How does it work? Cartridges filled with powdered dough , cheese, sauce, water and oil put the ingredients layer by layer onto a printer bed. The printer bed, which gets hot from below, cooks the food as it's being printed. Since most of the ingredients are powdered, they can be sent into space and stored for many years without going bad. Water makes food go sour, so the food powders are mixed with water and oil only when they are being printed. \\"Long-distance space travel requires more than 15 years of shelf life for food.\\" says Anjan Contractor, whose company developing the printer. \\" We take water out, and in that form, food will last maybe 30 years.\\" In outer space, there are far fewer choices for astronauts for dinner.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Veronica Guerin Context: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. When she becomes aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread.Guerin begins by interviewing the prepubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing projects. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved.As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her being removed from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation.On June 26, 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous citations for speeding she has ignored.

Answer:","completion":"The result of Veronica Guerin's death had a significant impact on both the public and the government in Ireland, leading to changes in legislation and a crackdown on organized crime. Following her murder, there was widespread outrage and grief among the Irish population. Guerin was seen as a symbol of courage and determination in her fight against the drug trade, and her death highlighted the increasing danger that journalists faced when reporting on organized crime. In response to the public outcry, the Irish government took swift action to address the issues of organized crime and drug trafficking. The Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) was established in 1996, just a few months after Guerin's death. CAB was designed to seize the assets of criminals, particularly those involved in drug trafficking, and redirect the funds towards the fight against organized crime. This move was a direct consequence of Guerin's investigative work and her relentless pursuit of the truth, which had exposed the extent of the drug trade in Dublin and its devastating effects on local communities. In addition to the creation of CAB, the Irish government also introduced new legislation to target organized crime more effectively. The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 were designed to strengthen the powers of law enforcement agencies in combating organized crime, allowing them to seize the assets of criminals and bring them to justice more easily. The introduction of these legislations was a direct response to the escalating crime levels in the country and the shock of Veronica Guerin's murder. Furthermore, Guerin's death also led to a renewed emphasis on the protection of journalists and the importance of freedom of the press. Her murder raised awareness about the risks that journalists face when reporting on sensitive issues and the need for greater protection and support for those working in dangerous environments. Perhaps one of the most significant outcomes of Guerin's death is the crackdown on organized crime figures in Ireland. Several high-profile criminals, including John Gilligan (the prime suspect in her murder) and John Traynor, were subsequently arrested and imprisoned. This was a clear message to criminals that the authorities were taking the issue of organized crime seriously, and the consequences of Guerin's death served as a strong deterrent. In summary, Veronica Guerin's death led to significant reforms in Ireland's approach to organized crime, including the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, the introduction of new legislations, and increased protection for journalists. Moreover, her work and sacrifice inspired a new generation of journalists and law enforcement officials to continue her fight against crime and help make the country a safer place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given a passage and a query based on the passage, generate an unambiguous, concise and simple answer to the query from information in the passage. Note that the answer may not be present in exact form. Do not allow your baby to crawl, walk around, or go to bed with the bottle. Doing so turns the bottle into a comfort item, may hinder two-handed development, and can lead to dental cavities. Offer the cup first, then the bottle. And it ends when the child no longer breastfeeds or takes a bottle. This process may last several weeks, a few months, or more than a year. Your baby may begin eating solid foods at about 6 months of age. At this point, you may want to offer cup-feeding to supplement breast- or bottle-feedings. How long does engorgement last? Fortunately, engorgement passes pretty quickly for most women. You can expect it to ease up in 24 to 48 hours if you're nursing well or pumping at least every two to three hours. If not treated, engorgement can take up to ten days to start to go away. Once the engorgement passes, your breasts will be softer, although still full of milk. If you're not nursing, it will probably get worse before it gets better. Here are some things you can do to reduce your chances of becoming engorged: 1 Breastfeed within two hours after birth if possible. (Your labor and delivery team should be able to help you with this.) 2 Nurse frequently – between eight and 12 times a day after the first 24 hours. The pain and discomfort from breast engorgement improve as your breasts stop making milk. You will likely feel better in 1 to 5 days. Home treatment, such as applying cold packs to the breasts, may relieve some of your symptoms. Don't worry -- the kind of fullness you feel in the beginning doesn't last, and your body is still making plenty of milk even if it doesn't feel that way. 7 Means of Relief It should only last for the first week or so, but engorgement can be painful for some women. Weaning is a gradual process. It starts when you begin giving solid food to your baby and ends when the child no longer breast - feeds or takes a bottle. This process may last a few months or more than a year.A rough outline of this process is as follows: Your baby begins eating solid foods at 4 to 6 months of age. Here are some things you can do to reduce your chances of becoming engorged: 1 Breastfeed within two hours after birth if possible. 2 Nurse frequently – between eight and 12 times a day after the first 24 hours. 3 Let your baby finish nursing on one breast before switching to other. Here's how you can make breastfeeding more comfortable and ease engorgement: 1 Just before nursing, place a warm compress on your breasts for a few minutes to get the milk flowing. 2 Nurse frequently, with no more than two to three hours between feedings. 3 While your baby is nursing, gently massage the breast he's on. Engorged breasts take place, because of the pressure of expanding cells, due to the new breast milk contained inside of them. Engorgement happens when the milk producing cells, are uncomfortably full. Engorgement is sometimes apparent in the areola and/or the breast; in one breast or in both breasts. (you may have just one engorged, sore swollen breast) Dealing with engorgement on top of having a new baby to care for, day and night, may be discouraging to a mother. The good news is, there are ways to treat breast engorgement. How Long does Engorgement Last? Nursing engorgement is temporary and usually only lasts three days, or until the mother's body has adapted to the needs of her baby. Breastfeeding and engorgement can also happen as a result of missed feeds or incorrect latching, which results in milk being left behind in the breast.

Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive. Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.","completion":"Based on the given information, car A would emit less unburned hydrocarbons compared to car B.

Catalytic converters play a crucial role in minimizing the levels of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide compounds in a car's exhaust. These harmful emissions are a result of the incomplete combustion of fuel in the engine. The catalysts present within the catalytic converter increase the rate of chemical reactions, helping to break down these harmful substances into less harmful ones before they are released into the atmosphere. In car A, the catalytic converter allows unburned hydrocarbons to be more easily converted into carbon dioxide and water. Additionally, it aids in further oxidation of carbon monoxide (another harmful gas) to carbon dioxide and helps transform nitrous oxide compounds back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. As a result, car A releases significantly less harmful substances into the atmosphere, contributing to cleaner air. On the other hand, car B is older and does not have a catalytic converter. Therefore, it is unable to break down the harmful emissions as effectively as car A. Car B would emit higher levels of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide compounds, which have negative environmental consequences, such as air pollution, smog, and acid rain. In conclusion, car A, with its newer design and the presence of a catalytic converter, is the better choice in terms of reduced emissions and environmental impact. While car B may have a more attractive design, its lack of a catalytic converter leads to higher emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and other harmful gases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose fury was turned on the tour's promoters upon learning her accompanist had been ill for months? , can you please find it? On 1 January 1948 Ferrier left for a four-week tour of North America, the first of three transatlantic trips she would make during the next three years. In New York she sang two performances of Das Lied von der Erde, with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic. Alma Mahler, the composer's widow, was present at the first of these, on 15 January. In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: \\"Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed\\". After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in Ottawa and Chicago before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February.During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated \\"this abominable accompanist\\" who deserved \\"a kick in the pants\\". When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: \\"What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me\\". Eventually, when Sándor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship.

He seeks out the expertise of Lt. Colonel John Henry Patterson, a British military engineer, to get the project back on track. Patterson travels from England to Tsavo, telling his wife, Helena, he will complete the project and be back in London for the birth of their son. He meets British supervisor Angus Starling, African foreman Samuel, and Doctor David Hawthorne. Hawthorne tells Patterson of a recent lion attack that has affected the project. That night, Patterson kills an approaching lion with one shot, earning the respect of the workmen and bringing the project back on schedule. However, not long afterwards, Mahina, the construction foreman, is dragged from his tent in the middle of the night. His half-eaten body is found the next morning. Patterson then attempts a second night-time lion hunt, but the following morning, another worker is found dead at the opposite end of the camp from Patterson's position. Patterson's only comfort now is the letters he receives from his wife. Soon, while the workers are gathering wood and building fire pits around the tents, a lion attacks the camp in the middle of the day. While Patterson, Starling and Samuel are tracking it to one end of the camp, another lion leaps upon them from the roof of a building, killing Starling with a slash to the throat and injuring Patterson. Despite the latter's efforts to kill them, both lions escape. Samuel states that there has never been a pair of man-eaters; they have always been solitary hunters.

(A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","completion":"(B). It is not possible to tell The statement \\"There was no boasting\\" can suggest the absence of self-promotion or overt displays of pride or superiority. While this behavior can be aligned with humility, which involves a modest or low view of one's own importance, it is not enough evidence to confirm that \\"they were humble.\\" Humility is a complex characteristic going beyond the absence of boasting. A humble individual often appreciates the strengths of others, overlooks their own strengths, maintains a perspective of their own weaknesses, appreciates the value of all things, and other similar qualities. They may also express kindness, generosity, and other positive traits. Humility is more than just restraining oneself from boasting or bragging. Moreover, the lack of boasting can result from other factors unrelated to humility. For example, it can be due to shyness, introversion, insecurity, a cultural norm, or a personal belief that boasting is inappropriate. Therefore, it would not be fully accurate to infer that \\"they were humble\\" from a mere lack of boasting. Thus, based on the given statement alone, it is not possible to tell if they were humble.

Paragraph : For a given medium, sound waves travel more slowly at lower temperatures. Question: When it is very warm what happens to the speed of items speed up or slow down? A:","completion":"When it is very warm, the speed of sound waves in a given medium tends to increase. This occurs due to the relationship between temperature and the properties of the medium through which sound waves travel. In the paragraph, it states that \\"for a given medium, sound waves travel more slowly at lower temperatures.\\" This implies that as the temperature decreases, the speed of sound waves also decreases in that medium. Consequently, when the temperature increases or becomes very warm, the speed of sound waves would be expected to increase. To provide more context, let's consider how temperature affects the properties of a medium, such as air. Air is a mixture of gas molecules that constantly move and collide with each other. When the air temperature increases, the gas molecules gain kinetic energy, causing them to move faster. This increased movement leads to more frequent and forceful collisions between the molecules, which in turn increase the speed at which sound waves can travel through the air. The same concept can be applied to other mediums, such as water or solid materials, for which the speed of sound waves is also influenced by temperature. As the temperature of the medium increases, the atoms or molecules within that medium experience increased movement and transmit sound waves more efficiently. So, to answer the question, when it is very warm, the speed of sound waves in a given medium generally increases, or \\"speeds up,\\" when compared to the same medium under lower temperature conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ted and his agent Danny Reed (Walter Abel) scoff at the plan, but wish him luck. Later at the airport flower shop, while ordering flowers for Lila from Ted, Danny is accosted by employee Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds) who recognizes him as a talent agent and begs him for a start in show business. Danny refers her to Holiday Inn and gives her a pass to Ted's club. That night, Linda sits at the performer's table with Jim, who pretends he owns a big club and isn't sure he could use an act like Hanover and Dixon. Linda pretends she's a celebrity and friend of Ted's, then escapes when the two performers come to Jim's table. The next morning, Christmas Day, Linda arrives at Holiday Inn, where she meets Jimâboth realizing they were fooling each other the previous evening. Jim is preparing the place for New Year's Eve, and they take to each other immediately. Jim sings her his new song, \\"White Christmas\\", which he would have performed had the inn been open that night. Later that week, on New Year's Eve, Holiday Inn opens to a packed house. Meanwhile, in New York City, Ted learns that Lila is leaving him for a Texas millionaire. Drinking heavily, he drives up to Holiday Inn to talk with Jim, arriving at midnight. While wandering aimlessly across the dance floor,... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Jim Hardy has the idea of turning his old barn in Connecticut into an entertainment venue called \\"Holiday Inn\\", which will only be open on public holidays. This idea comes to him after experiencing a difficult time adjusting to farm life and feeling heartbroken by Lila's decision to stay with Ted as his dancing partner. Jim sees the potential in the barn to be transformed into a unique and attractive venue for people to enjoy musical acts and performances during public holidays. The Holiday Inn concept also serves as a means for Jim to stay connected to the world of performing arts, despite leaving the New York City nightlife scene."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: how do you fix hunger?","completion":"Fixing hunger is a complex, multi-faceted issue that requires a combination of short-term and long-term strategies. Here are some steps to address and potentially fix hunger: Step 1: Assessing the extent of hunger Identify the regions and populations most affected by hunger by gathering data on malnutrition, food insecurity, household income, and poverty levels. Step 2: Identify root causes Determine the underlying factors contributing to hunger, which may include poverty, food scarcity, lack of access to nutritious food, climate change, political instability, and conflict. Step 3: Implement immediate intervention programs Launch food aid programs to provide immediate support for populations suffering from severe hunger and malnutrition. This could include food distribution initiatives, setting up food banks, and providing emergency food supplies. Step 4: Support local food production and farming Invest in agriculture, support local farmers, and provide the necessary tools and resources to improve crop yields and access to markets. This will help in creating a more sustainable food supply system and improve the livelihoods of the local population. Step 5: Improve infrastructure and access to markets Access to markets is essential for farmers to sell their products, which enables them to earn a living and feed their families. Therefore, it's important to develop rural infrastructure and transportation systems to connect farmers with the markets. Step 6: Promote education and awareness Help people understand the importance of a balanced diet and create awareness about sustainable farming practices. This would involve developing educational programs and communication campaigns targeting both urban and rural populations. Step 7: Implement social protection policies Implement policies that help reduce poverty and provide support for vulnerable populations, such as cash transfers, food subsidies, and public work programs. These policies can provide financial support to those struggling to afford food and help them meet their basic needs. Step 8: Encourage international cooperation Collaborate with international organizations and other countries to share best practices, resources, and technology that can help alleviate hunger and improve food security worldwide. Step 9: Monitor progress and adapt Continuously gather data, evaluate the impact of implemented programs, and adjust the approach as needed to ensure that efforts to fix hunger are effective and sustainable. By following these steps and addressing the root causes, it is possible to work towards a future in which hunger is significantly reduced or eradicated."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The merged group, to be called Peabody, will be caretaker for more than 55,000 homes across London and the South East. Peabody chief executive Stephen Howlett will retire, with Family Mosaic's Brendan Sarsfield taking the helm. Lord Kerslake, Peabody's chairman who will remain in-post, said the combined group will be able to achieve more \\"together than we could achieve alone\\". Housing associations are non-profit organisations providing social housing, with any surplus money used for maintenance of properties. The sector is undergoing a transformation after the government launched a voluntary right-to-buy scheme for housing association tenants. The first sales under the policy took place in September. The scheme builds on a policy introduced by the Tories in the 1980s, which allowed council house tenants to buy their homes. This proved hugely popular, but has been blamed for contributing to the lack of affordable housing. Ministers have promised that each house sold under the new system will be replaced on a one-for-one basis, although there are still question marks over how the policy will be refunded and properties replaced. The government has also imposed annual rental cuts of 1% a year on housing association tenants. A larger, merged group should have better access to financing and resources to build more homes. Peabody is involved in big regeneration plans for Thamesmead in east London. Last week Affinity Sutton and Circle Housing Group merged to become the largest housing association in the UK, and one of the largest housebuilders. It aims to build 50,000 new homes in the next 10 years. Sir Robin Young, chairman of Clarion Housing, said that by \\"combining forces\\" it was rising to the government's challenge that housing associations \\"deliver more for less\\". Also on Wednesday, the L&Q and East Thames associations announced the completion of their merger and details of a Â£2.6bn financing package to fund the building of new homes. More mergers between the UK's 1,500 housing associations look likely.

As polar ice caps melt, it leads to several consequences: 1. Rising sea levels: The melted ice flows into the ocean and increases sea levels. This can lead to coastal erosion, flooding, and displacement of populations living in low-lying areas. 2. Loss of habitat: The melting of polar ice caps shrinks the habitat of various Arctic and Antarctic species like polar bears, penguins, and seals. This can lead to a decline in their population and even extinction if their habitats continue to shrink. 3. Altered ocean currents: Freshwater from the melted ice can change ocean salinity and disrupt ocean currents, which further influence weather patterns and cause more extreme weather events like droughts, heatwaves, and storms. 4. Release of stored carbon dioxide and methane: The melting of permafrost in the Arctic regions can release stored greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, which exacerbate global warming. 5. Positive feedback loop: The loss of reflective ice means that more of the sun's energy gets absorbed by the Earth, accelerating further warming and ice melting. In summary, the final step in the process you described is the disruption of ecosystems, weather patterns, and sea levels due to the melting of polar ice caps, resulting from increased temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions and their trapping of heat within the Earth's atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: James is driving down the street in his town. For some reason today hes very curious about the things that he sees. He looks around as hes driving and the street lights catch his attention. He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside. But I can use this background: A vapor light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting. What is an answer for this question: Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The vapor light is more energy efficient than the regular light bulb. To understand the energy efficiency difference between vapor lights and regular light bulbs, it's important to compare their respective technologies, energy consumption, and light output. Vapor lights, such as sodium vapor or mercury vapor lights, work through a process of electroluminescence, wherein an electric current is passed through a mixture of gases to produce visible light. This technology allows for the creation of bright, long-lasting illumination with lower energy consumption. Sodium vapor lights, commonly used in streetlights, produce a yellowish light, while mercury vapor lights produce a bluish light. Both types of vapor lights are more energy efficient than incandescent light bulbs, which rely on heating a tungsten filament to produce light. Incandescent bulbs produce a significant amount of heat in addition to light, which results in wasted energy. In terms of energy efficiency, compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) and light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs are also worth mentioning. CFLs work by passing an electric current through a gas to create ultraviolet (UV) light, which then interacts with a phosphor coating inside the bulb to produce visible light. LEDs generate light through the movement of electrons within a semiconductor material. Both CFLs and LEDs are considered more energy efficient than incandescent bulbs and have longer lifespans. However, vapor lights still outperform CFLs and LEDs when it comes to brightness, making them ideal for outdoor applications that require high-intensity illumination, such as streetlights. In conclusion, vapor lights are more energy-efficient than regular light bulbs, particularly incandescent bulbs, due to their method of producing light through electroluminescence rather than heat generation. This makes them a better choice for situations where bright, long-lasting illumination is required, with the added benefit of reduced energy consumption."},{"prompt":"Instructions: This task is about translating a given English language sentence to Yoruba language.

Be on the lookout for increased bodily aches and pains as a trigger for depression. It is essential to pay close attention to these subtle signs, as they might indicate that an older person is struggling with their mental health. Furthermore, these physical symptoms might also limit their ability to participate in social activities, which could exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness, both of which are potential factors contributing to depression. Additionally, it's crucial to observe changes in behavior and daily routines, such as loss of interest in hobbies and a decrease in social interactions. Seniors who are struggling with depression might also show increased irritability and a lack of motivation, making it difficult for them to engage in self-care and maintain a healthy lifestyle. In some cases, older adults might even exhibit cognitive symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating, memory problems, and slower thought processes. Depression in elderly individuals is a complex issue, and recognizing the signs can be challenging due to the unique ways it presents itself. However, by staying vigilant and prioritizing open communication with older loved ones, you can help address mental health issues early and provide the necessary support to help them navigate through this challenging time.

The widow, disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son. As a despondent young man, Barry becomes infatuated with his older cousin, Nora Brady. Though she charms him during a card game, she later shows interest in a well-off British Army captain, John Quin, much to Barry's dismay. Nora and her family plan to leverage their finances through marriage, while Barry holds Quin in contempt and escalates the situation until a fateful duel beside a river. In the aftermath, Barry is urged to flee from incoming police and head through the countryside towards Dublin, but along the way he is robbed of purse, pistol, and horse by Captain Feeney, an infamous highwayman. Dejected, Barry carries on to the next town, where he hears a promotional spiel to join the British Army, offering the chance at fame and glory (and a lifelong pension) in return for good service. Barry enlists. Some time after joining the regiment, Barry encounters Captain Grogan, a warm-hearted family friend. Grogan informs him that Barry did not in fact kill Quin, his dueling pistol having only been loaded with tow. The duel was staged by Nora's family to be rid of Barry so that their finances would be secured through a lucrative marriage.

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. Determine if the provided SQL statement properly addresses the given question. Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Georges was the seventh tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season. It became the second most destructive storm of the season after Hurricane Mitch, the costliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and the deadliest since Hurricane Gordon in 1994. Georges killed 604 people, mainly on the island of Hispaniola, and caused extensive damage resulting at just under 10 billion (1998 US dollars, USD) in damages mostly in St. Kitts and Nevis, Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. - Nevis is a small island in the Caribbean Sea that forms part of the inner arc of the Leeward Islands chain of the West Indies. Nevis and the neighbouring island of Saint Kitts constitute one country: the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. Nevis is located near the northern end of the Lesser Antilles archipelago, about 350 km east-southeast of Puerto Rico and 80 km west of Antigua. Its area is and the capital is Charlestown. - Puerto Rico, (Spanish for \\"Rich Port\\") officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\\") and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea. - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America. - Hurricane Mitch was the most powerful and destructive hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season, with maximum sustained winds of . The storm was the thirteenth tropical storm, ninth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the season. Along with Hurricane Georges, Mitch was the most notable hurricane in the season. At the time, Hurricane Mitch was the strongest Atlantic hurricane observed in the month of October, though it has since been surpassed by Hurricane Wilma of the 2005 season. The hurricane matched the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record (it has since dropped to seventh). - Hispaniola (Spanish: \\"La Española\\"; Latin: \\"Hispaniola\\"; Taíno: \\"Haiti\\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most populous island in the world. - The effects of Hurricane Georges in Mississippi included 676.8 million in damages but no fatalities . Hurricane Georges was a Category 2 storm in the 1998 Hurricane season . - The 1998 Atlantic hurricane season was one of the deadliest and costliest Atlantic hurricane seasons that featured the highest number of storm-related fatalities in over 200 years. It officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The first tropical cyclone, Tropical Storm Alex, developed on July 27, and the season's final storm, Hurricane Nicole, became extratropical on December 1. The strongest storm, Mitch, was tied with Hurricane Dean for the seventh most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded. Mitch is also the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history. The system dropped tremendous amounts of rainfall in Central America, causing 19,000 confirmed deaths and at least 6.2 billion (1998 USD) in damage. The season was the first since Hurricane Andrew in the 1992 season to feature a Category 5 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson hurricane wind scale. - Mississippi is a state in the southern region of the United States, with part of its southern border formed by the Gulf of Mexico. Its western border is formed by the Mississippi River. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'cyclone'.

The U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan dropped more bombs during the first quarter of 2018 than it has in the same period in any of the last 15 years, according to Pentagon data. The increased bombing is the latest evidence the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan is significantly intensifying since U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new military strategy for the country in August. Coalition planes dropped 1,186 weapons on Afghanistan during the first three months of 2018, according to figures released by U.S. Air Forces Central Command. The previous record (1,083) was set during the height of the war in 2011. The U.S. has not released 2001 to 2003 airstrike data. Those figures do not include activity by the Afghan Air Force (AAF), which has stepped up its aerial bombardment since gaining the ability to conduct airstrikes two years ago. The AAF carries out between 4 to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. If recent trends are any indication, 2018 is likely to get even more violent. Fighting traditionally picks up during the warmer months, and the coalition has expanded its bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as narcotic labs and other Taliban revenue sources. But there is little indication the expanded airstrikes are helping end the conflict, says Thomas Johnson, an Afghanistan specialist who teaches national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. \\"It's basically a tactic of desperation,\\" said Johnson, author of Taliban Narratives: The Use of Power and Stories in the Afghanistan Conflict. \\"There's never been an insurgency in history that's been defeated purely through air power.\\" Even high-level U.S. military officials concede the conflict remains a stalemate. According to the latest U.S. military estimate, the Afghan government controls 56 percent of Afghanistan's districts, with insurgents controlling or contesting the rest. Insurgent attacks also have continued. Nearly 60 people died Sunday when an Islamic State... According to the above context, answer the following question.

For the g+5 building, what is the minimum steel section used as bracings in staad? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"For a G+5 building, determining the minimum steel section used as bracings depends on various factors, such as the building's design specifications, local building codes, load conditions, seismic requirements, and material properties. STAAD is a structural analysis and design software that can be utilized to help engineers decide the best steel sections. Now, let us address the two questions separately: 1. For the G+5 building, what is the minimum steel section used as bracings? The minimum steel section for bracings in a G+5 building can be determined by evaluating the building's structural system, such as the type of bracing (concentric or eccentric bracing), the building's configuration, and the building's code requirements. Some commonly used steel sections for bracings in steel buildings are angles, channels, or hollow square/rectangular tubes. The size of the steel section would vary based on the factors mentioned earlier. In general, engineers would identify the appropriate steel section by following these steps: a. Define the lateral force resisting system for the building. b. Determine the loads on the bracings according to the building code and load combinations. c. Establish the load path for the load transfer from the floors to bracings and verify the adequacy of connections. d. Select a starting steel section based on similar projects, consulting engineers' experience, or using simplified design tables found in codes and books. e. Analyze the structure and check the steel section for its capacity to handle the loads as demanded by the building. f. Iterate the section selection process and perform checks until a suitable section is identified that meets safety, serviceability, and economy criteria. 2. For the G+5 building, what is the minimum steel section used as bracings in STAAD? STAAD is a structural analysis and design software used to perform the calculations mentioned above more efficiently and accurately. When designing the bracings for a G+5 building in STAAD, the software helps you define the geometry of the structure, apply loads and boundary conditions, and conduct an analysis. To determine the minimum steel section in STAAD, follow these steps: a. Model the G+5 building structure accurately, including the bracing members, in STAAD. b. Define the material properties and member sections, including preliminary steel sections for bracings. c. Apply appropriate loads, such as dead, live, wind, and seismic loads, as per the local building code requirements. d. Perform the structural analysis and examine the results for member forces, displacements, and stresses. e. Evaluate the adequacy of the preliminary steel section for bracings by performing code-based checks on capacities. f. If the steel section is not adequate, optimize the steel section by using an iterative process while maintaining all the other parameters constant. g. Finalize the steel section once it fulfills all the design and safety requirements. To answer the question, \\"Would you say that these questions are the same?\\" - Yes, these two questions have the same objective, which is determining the minimum steel section for bracings in a G+5 building. However, the second question explicitly mentions using STAAD software for analysis and design, while the first question does not specify any software usage. The fundamental procedure remains the same, and the second question essentially extends to include the use of STAAD to assist in the design process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"What aspect of culture has been most affected by Buddhist influence when speaking of the Bamar?\\" Context: \\"A diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar, the majority culture is primarily Buddhist and Bamar. Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries. This is manifested in its language, cuisine, music, dance and theatre. The arts, particularly literature, have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism. Considered the national epic of Myanmar, the Yama Zatdaw, an adaptation of India's Ramayana, has been influenced greatly by Thai, Mon, and Indian versions of the play. Buddhism is practised along with nat worship, which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The aspect of Bamar culture that has been most affected by Buddhist influence is undoubtedly its religious practices and beliefs, which in turn have had significant impacts on various other aspects of the culture, such as arts, literature, customs, and architecture. The majority of the Bamar people practice Theravada Buddhism, which is deeply ingrained in their daily lives and cultural expression. This primary belief system shapes the customs and local traditions of the Bamar people. One particularly significant way that Buddhism has influenced Bamar culture is through the blending of Buddhist beliefs with indigenous animistic nat worship. This unique combination has resulted in a complex system of rituals and rites used to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats, which are spirits or minor deities associated with natural elements or human activities. These rituals often include elements of Buddhist teachings and symbolism, showcasing the deep entwinement of Buddhism with traditional Bamar beliefs. Buddhist influence in Bamar culture is also prominent in the realm of literature and the arts. The Yama Zatdaw, considered to be the national epic of Myanmar, is an excellent example of this. As an adaptation of India's Ramayana, it is not only influenced by Buddhist teachings but also by the cultures of neighboring countries like Thailand and India, whose renditions of the Ramayana have left their mark on the Bamar adaptation. Moreover, numerous works of literature, poetry, and folktales in Myanmar explore Buddhist themes, moral values, and stories from the Jataka tales, which recount the previous lives of the Buddha. In terms of architecture, the most iconic and visible manifestation of Buddhist influence on Bamar culture can be seen in the numerous pagodas and monasteries that dominate the landscape of Myanmar. The elaborate architecture of these religious structures, adorned with intricate carvings, sculptures, and murals, reflects not only the importance of Buddhism in the lives of the Bamar people but also the extent to which religious devotion and artistic expression are intertwined. The Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon and the Ananda Temple in Bagan are prime examples of the beautiful craftsmanship and dedication seen in Buddhist inspired architecture throughout Myanmar. Buddhism has also left its mark on Bamar dance, music, and theatre, which often incorporate stories and themes from Buddhist teachings and literature. The traditional Bamar dance, for example, incorporates elements such as the stylized movement of hands, body posture, and facial expressions that show deep connections to Buddhist teachings and symbolism. In conclusion, the aspect of the Bamar culture most significantly affected by Buddhist influence is its religious practices and beliefs. However, the impact of Buddhism on Bamar culture extends far beyond its religious elements and has deeply enriched various facets of the culture such as arts, literature, customs, and architecture, making it an integral part of the Bamar people's identity and heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? a fresh view","completion":"Based on the given short review, it appears to have a positive opinion of the movie. The phrase \\"a fresh view\\" suggests that the reviewer believes the movie offers a new and unique perspective, which is usually considered a good thing. However, it is important to note that this is a very brief review, and as such, there might be limitations in accurately gauging the reviewer's full opinion. It would be helpful to have additional context or more detailed information about the movie being discussed, as well as a more comprehensive evaluation of the film, including factors such as storytelling, acting, direction, visual effects, and other specific elements that contribute to the overall experience. In general, people tend to appreciate movies that stand out from the crowd and provide new, fresh perspectives on their chosen subject matter or themes. This is because it is quite common for movies and other forms of media to rehash cliché ideas and rely on tried-and-true formulaic elements. A fresh or unique viewpoint can make a movie more engaging, thought-provoking, and enjoyable, so it is likely that the reviewer sees this as a major positive aspect. However, it's also important to recognize that a fresh view, while potentially a positive attribute, may not necessarily guarantee that a movie is universally loved or even considered a critical success. There are many factors that can contribute to how well a movie is received, and the novelty of its approach is only one of them. Other elements, such as the quality of the writing and performances, the effectiveness of the storytelling, and the emotional impact of the narrative, also play crucial roles in determining how a movie is perceived by audiences and critics alike. In summation, although the given review is brief, it seems to express a positive opinion about the movie due to its fresh viewpoint. However, without further context and additional details, it is impossible to paint a complete picture of the reviewer's true feelings and impressions of the film. A more comprehensive review would be necessary to fully understand how this person truly perceives the movie, as well as how the movie stands in terms of critical and audience reception."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. Question: How long would the author wait before they had the children do a second self portrait? === The answer to the above question is Choices: (1). five years later; (2). almost a full school year; (3). when they graduate high school; (4). not enough information; Answer:","completion":"(2). almost a full school year;"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you have the same problem? Perhaps your parents had the same problem when they were your age long ago. Why does it seem that some parents are not so friendly in their children's eyes? One of the biggest things is when someone becomes a parent, he / she likes worrying things. They worry about everything about you, from the time you were born. They do a lot for you, though something would make you angry, because they care about you and worry about you. They worry about your choice of friends, the food you eat, your work at school, how much sleep you get, etc. All these things are part of your life. They want you to grow up healthily and happily. So how can you make things easier on yourself? It's easier than you think. Just make sure your parents know what you're doing. Get them to know your friends. Phone if you stay somewhere else so that your parents don't call every hospital in the phone book looking for your body. Say sorry to them when you make mistakes. Take responsibility for what you have done. Talk about your ideas with them. They may talk about theirs with you. Most of all, try to think about why your parents do this or do that. They are still practicing being parents and need help you can give them. Someday, when you become a parent, they may be able to help you know how to get on with your children.

Emily suspects that the parents have been mistreating Lilith, and proposes to her department to take the child away from her parents' custody. Emily's fears are confirmed when Lilith's parents try to kill her by roasting her in the oven at their home. Emily saves Lilith with the help of Detective Mike Barron (Ian McShane). Lilith is originally sent to a children's home, but she begs Emily to look after her instead. With the agreement of the board, Emily is assigned to take care of Lilith until a suitable foster family comes along. In the meantime, Lilith's parents, Edward and Margaret (Callum Keith Rennie and Kerry O'Malley), are placed in a mental institution.Not too long after Lilith moves in, strange things begin to happen around Emily. Two weeks later, another of Emily's cases, a boy named Diego (Alexander Conti), suddenly murders his parents, and Barron informs Emily that somebody phoned Diego from her house the night before the crime. As she is suspected of involvement in the incident, Lilith undergoes a psychiatric evaluation by Emily's best friend, Douglas J. Ames (Bradley Cooper). During the session, however, Lilith turns the evaluation around, asking Douglas what his fears are and subtly threatening him. That night while studying he receives a strange phone call in his apartment, Douglas is panicked by the sight of a mass of hornets coming out of his body and kills himself in his bathroom by snapping his own neck.Emily gradually becomes fearful of having Lilith in her home, so she heads to the mental asylum for answers from Lilith's parents. They tell her that Lilith is a demon who feeds on feelings, and that they tried to kill her in an attempt to save themselves.

Hen house: This is an unlikely location for George to hunt foxes, as hen houses are typically for keeping chickens safe from predators, not for hunting them. This option can be eliminated. 2. Painting: This choice doesn't make any sense as a location for hunting foxes, since a painting is a visual art form and not a geographical location. This option can be eliminated. 3. Virginia: Virginia is a state in the United States with a long history of fox hunting, including established hunting clubs and suitable natural habitats for foxes. This choice is plausible and fits the context well. 4. California: While California has varied landscapes and wildlife, it isn't specifically known for fox hunting in the same way that Virginia is. Moreover, the other options don't provide any strong reason to choose California. This option is less likely than Virginia, but we can't fully eliminate it yet. 5. Lion's den: This option seems out of context, as lion's dens are habitats for lions, not foxes. Moreover, hunting foxes in a lion's den would be quite dangerous. This option can be eliminated.

He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Blérancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect François Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House.

A:","completion":"A: Team Alpha studied more people with cholesterol and other materials deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. This conclusion is based on the given information that two teams of researchers studied different diseases: team Alpha focused on people with cholesterol issues, while team Beta concentrated on people with Parkinson's disease. Cholesterol, along with other materials like fatty substances, calcium, and cellular waste, can accumulate on the interior walls of arteries, leading to a condition known as atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the hardening and narrowing of the arteries, which can restrict blood flow and potentially lead to serious health issues, such as heart attack or stroke. Considering team Alpha's focus on people with cholesterol, their research would involve studying the accumulation of cholesterol and other materials on the arterial walls, as this is a significant aspect of the condition. On the other hand, team Beta's research on Parkinson's disease pertains to a completely different set of medical issues, relating primarily to the nervous system and motor control functions. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and can cause tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with balance, coordination, and walking. While it is possible that some individuals with Parkinson's disease might also have cholesterol-related issues, team Beta's primary focus would be on studying the neurological aspects of the disease, rather than the cholesterol and its impact on arterial walls. In conclusion, team Alpha studied more people with cholesterol and other materials deposited on the interior of the arterial wall because their primary research focus was on cholesterol and its effects on the body, while team Beta focused on the study of Parkinson's disease and its related neurological impacts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: This article: Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture.

This is some data: 101 Helena, density, 2.0 (gramPerCubicCentimetres); 101 Helena, escapeVelocity, 0.0348 (kilometrePerSeconds); 101 Helena, apoapsis, 441092000.0 (kilometres). Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The provided data contains specific information about an astronomical object, 101 Helena. To better understand the data, let's break down each piece of information and discuss them in detail. 1. Density of 101 Helena: The first data point is the density of 101 Helena, which is given as 2.0 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). In the context of celestial bodies, density refers to the mass per unit volume, which quantifies how compressed or packed together the substance that makes up the object is. A higher density typically implies a more compact and closely packed object, while a lower density indicates a looser, more sparse configuration. In comparison to Earth's average density of 5.52 g/cm³, 101 Helena's density is much lower, which suggests that it might be composed of lighter elements and/or less compressed materials. 2. Escape velocity of 101 Helena: The second data point states that 101 Helena has an escape velocity of 0.0348 kilometers per second (km/s). Escape velocity is the minimum speed needed for an object to break free from the gravitational pull of a celestial body. The greater the escape velocity, the stronger the gravitational force exerted by the body, which makes it more difficult for objects to escape its gravitational field. A lower escape velocity signifies weaker gravity. For reference, the escape velocity on Earth is about 11.19 km/s, which means that 101 Helena has a considerably weaker gravitational pull on objects in its vicinity. 3. Apoapsis of 101 Helena: Lastly, the apoapsis of 101 Helena is provided as 441,092,000 kilometers (km). In astronomy, apoapsis refers to the point in the orbit of an object around a celestial body at which the distance between them is greatest. This distance is often used to describe the shape and size of an object's orbit. The given apoapsis distance of 101 Helena suggests that its orbit is rather large, and may also indicate that it is an object of the main asteroid belt formed between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. In conclusion, the provided data offers an overview of various characteristics of the astronomical object, 101 Helena, including its density, escape velocity, and distance at apoapsis. This data can be useful in understanding the physical properties, composition and the position 101 Helena occupies in our solar system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By Associated Press PUBLISHED: 23:55 EST, 19 December 2012 | UPDATED: 02:07 EST, 20 December 2012 The New York Public Library is moving forward with a 300million renovation of its landmark Fifth Avenue building that will more than double its public space and fireproof the majestic main reading room, the library president said on Wednesday. But the plans he presented at a news conference have drawn withering criticism from some respected architecture experts, including Ada Louise Huxtable, who says the grand Beaux Art edifice is embarking on 'its own destruction.' Library President Tony Marx has a different vision for the building completed in 1911. The library was also a film location for Breakfast at OPTIONS: - Ada Louise Huxtable - Associated Press - Beaux Art - Bryant Park - Fifth Avenue - New York Public Library - Tiffany's - Tony Marx","completion":"In the bustling city of New York, the iconic New York Public Library stood as a symbol of culture and knowledge for over a century. The grand Beaux Art edifice, a landmark on Fifth Avenue, was known not only as a sanctuary of learning but also as a popular film location, featured in classics like Breakfast at Tiffany's. However, the 21st century brought with it the need for change. The Library President, Tony Marx, aware of the historical importance, sought to breathe new life into the old building. He envisioned a 300 million renovation that would more than double the library's public space and fireproof the majestic main reading room. However, this grand plan was met with opposition. Ada Louise Huxtable, a respected architecture expert, was one of those who criticized the renovation plans, stating that the library was embarking on \\"its own destruction.\\" The dispute between the preservation of historical values and the need for modern amenities began to divide the city's public opinions. The two visions for the library's future seemed irreconcilable, and the decision-makers faced a difficult choice. The library board weighed the arguments carefully, acknowledging the importance of preserving the building's architectural heritage while addressing the growing needs of the community. The decision, though unpopular with some, was ultimately to proceed with a compromise. Balancing the concerns of Ada Louise Huxtable and those like her, the renovation plans were amended to preserve the architectural character and essence of the grand Beaux Art façade. The interior was renovated to accommodate the growing needs of the population, providing state-of-the-art facilities that honored the building's past while embracing the future. The library reopened to the public, boasting an impressive blend of history and modernity that attracted new generations of library-goers. The main reading room, with its fireproofed, soaring ceilings, welcomed researchers and thinkers, while modern study spaces, multimedia resources, and technological upgrades abounded, equipping the library to serve its community well into the future. Outside, the building's exterior retained its classic Beaux Art elegance, a symbol of the library's rich history. The renovations were so well-balanced that even Ada Louise Huxtable, the most outspoken critic, softened her stance toward the changes that had occurred. The New York Public Library, having weathered turbulent times, emerged as a shining example of adaptation and resilience - both in preserving the architectural needs of the past and serving the diverse, ever-changing needs of the modern city. The renovation masterfully fused the old with the new, forging a brilliant testimony to New York's ability to blend history with progress. Stretching from Fifth Avenue to Bryant Park, the library stands as proof that controversial decisions and careful listening can lead to outcomes that serve as beacons of hope and compromise in a rapidly changing world. And inside those hallowed walls, the love for knowledge, culture, and artistry continued to flourish, in both physical and digital forms, reflecting the indefatigable spirit of the city that never sleeps."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Room 2: Giovanni Bellini, youngest and most gifted member of the painter family, brings gentle humanity to his Enthroned Madonna with Job and St. Sebastian (1485).\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Giovanni Bellini was the youngest and most gifted member of the family.\\"?","completion":"If the given premise is true – \\"Room 2: Giovanni Bellini, youngest and most gifted member of the painter family, brings gentle humanity to his Enthroned Madonna with Job and St. Sebastian (1485)\\" – it does entail the hypothesis \\"Giovanni Bellini was the youngest and most gifted member of the family.\\" Let us dissect the premise and analyze the components to understand why it supports the hypothesis. The premise can be broken down into several assertions: 1. Giovanni Bellini is a member of the painter family. 2. Among the painter family members, he is the youngest. 3. Among the painter family members, he is the most gifted. 4. Giovanni Bellini painted Enthroned Madonna with Job and St. Sebastian in 1485. 5. The painting Enthroned Madonna with Job and St. Sebastian showcases gentle humanity. The hypothesis can also be broken down into two assertions: 1. Giovanni Bellini is the youngest member of the family. 2. Giovanni Bellini is the most gifted member of the family. Now, looking at the assertions within the premise, we can notice that Assertion 2 and Assertion 3 directly correspond with the two assertions of the hypothesis. Assertion 2 states that Giovanni Bellini is the youngest amongst the painter family, which aligns with Assertion 1 of the hypothesis. Assertion 3 states that Giovanni Bellini is the most gifted within the painter family, which matches Assertion 2 of the hypothesis. Assertions 1, 4, and 5 from the premise provide relevant context and specific details about Giovanni Bellini's artistic career and accomplishments, such as being part of the painter family and creating Enthroned Madonna with Job and St. Sebastian in 1485. Although they do not directly or independently support the hypothesis, they reinforce the notion that Giovanni Bellini's exemplary qualities (specifically, his gentle humanity) and achievements contribute to his standing as the most gifted member of the family. In conclusion, if we accept the premise as true, it does entail the hypothesis, as the statements within the premise directly support the notion that Giovanni Bellini was both the youngest and the most gifted member of the painter family. The premise offers additional insights into his artistic talent and the influence of his work, which further solidifies his position as the family's most gifted artist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Her eighteen books and numerous articles, on topics ranging from totalitarianism to epistemology, had a lasting influence on political theory. Arendt is widely considered one of the most important political philosophers of the twentieth century. As a Jew, Arendt chose to leave Nazi Germany in 1933, and lived in Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and France before escaping to the United States in 1941 via Portugal. Arendt was born into a secular family of German Jews in Linden (now a part of Hanover), the daughter of Martha (born Cohn) and Paul Arendt. She grew up in Konigsberg (renamed Kaliningrad when it was annexed to the Soviet Union in 1946) and Berlin. Arendt's family was thoroughly assimilated and she later remembered: \\"With us from Germany, the word 'assimilation' received a 'deep' philosophical meaning. You can hardly realize how serious we were about it.\\" Arendt came to define her Jewish identity negatively after encountering antisemitism as an adult. She came to greatly identify with Rahel Varnhagen, a nineteenth-century Prussian hostess who desperately wanted to assimilate into German culture, only to be rejected because she was born Jewish. Arendt later said of Varnhagen that she was \\"my very closest woman friend, unfortunately dead a hundred years now.\\" After completing her high school studies in 1924, she enrolled at the University of Marburg, where she spent a year studying philosophy with Martin Heidegger. According to Hans Jonas, her only German-Jewish classmate, in her year at the university, Arendt began a long and problematic romantic relationship with Heidegger, for which she was later criticized because of his support for the Nazi Party while he was rector at the University of Freiburg. After a year at Marburg, Arendt spent a semester at Freiburg University, attending the lectures of Edmund Husserl. In 1926 she moved to the University of Heidelberg, where in 1929, she completed her dissertation under the existentialist philosopher-psychologist Karl Jaspers. Her thesis was Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin: Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation (\\"On the concept of love in the thought of Saint Augustine: Attempt at a philosophical interpretation\\").

Francis Albert Sinatra was born on December 12, 1915, in an upstairs tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino \\"Marty\\" Sinatra and Natalina \\"Dolly\\" Garaventa. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Sinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s. While films appealed to him, being exceptionally self-confident, he was rarely enthusiastic towards his own acting, once remarking that \\"pictures stink\\". Sinatra made his film debut in 1941, performing in an uncredited sequence in Las Vegas Nights, singing \\"I'll Never Smile Again\\" with Tommy Dorsey's The Pied Pipers. In 1943 he had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in Charles Barton's Reveille with Beverly, making a brief appearance singing \\"Night and Day\\". The following year he was given his leading roles in Higher and Higher and Step Lively for RKO Pictures. In 1945, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cast Sinatra opposite Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson in the Technicolor musical Anchors Aweigh, in which he played a sailor on leave in Hollywood for four days. A major success, it garnered several Academy Award wins and nominations, and the song \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily\\", sung by Sinatra in the film, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 1946, Sinatra briefly appeared at the end of Richard Whorf's commercially successful Till the Clouds Roll By, a Technicolor musical biopic of Jerome Kern, in which he sang \\"Ol' Man River. In 1949, Sinatra co-starred with Gene Kelly in the Technicolor musical Take Me Out to the Ball Game, a film set in 1908, in which Sinatra and Kelly play baseball players who are part-time vaudevillians. He teamed up with Kelly for a third time in On the Town, playing a sailor on leave in New York City. Today the film is rated very highly by critics, and in 2006 it ranked No. 19 on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals. Both Double Dynamite (1951), an RKO Irving Cummings comedy produced by Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pevney's Meet Danny Wilson (1952) failed to make an impression.

Jean Desire Gustave Courbet (French: [gystav kuRbe]; 10 June 1819 - 31 December 1877) was a French painter who led the Realism movement in 19th-century French painting. Committed to painting only what he could see, he rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation of visual artists. His independence set an example that was important to later artists, such as the Impressionists and the Cubists. Courbet occupies an important place in 19th-century French painting as an innovator and as an artist willing to make bold social statements through his work. In 1855, Courbet submitted fourteen paintings for exhibition at the Exposition Universelle. Three were rejected for lack of space, including A Burial at Ornans and his other monumental canvas The Artist's Studio. Refusing to be denied, Courbet took matters into his own hands. He displayed forty of his paintings, including The Artist's Studio, in his own gallery called The Pavilion of Realism (Pavillon du Realisme) which was a temporary structure that he erected next door to the official Salon-like Exposition Universelle. The work is an allegory of Courbet's life as a painter, seen as an heroic venture, in which he is flanked by friends and admirers on the right, and challenges and opposition to the left. Friends on the right include the art critics Champfleury, and Charles Baudelaire, and art collector Alfred Bruyas. On the left are figures (priest, prostitute, grave digger, merchant and others) who represent what Courbet described in a letter to Champfleury as \\"the other world of trivial life, the people, misery, poverty, wealth, the exploited and the exploiters, the people who live off death.\\" In the foreground of the left-hand side is a man with dogs, who was not mentioned in Courbet's letter to Champfleury. X-rays show he was painted in later, but his role in the painting is important: he is an allegory of the then current French Emperor, Napoleon III, identified by his famous hunting dogs and iconic twirled moustache. By placing him on the left, Courbet publicly shows his disdain for the emperor and depicts him as a criminal, suggesting that his \\"ownership\\" of France is an illegal one. Although artists like Eugene Delacroix were ardent champions of his effort, the public went to the show mostly out of curiosity and to deride him. Attendance and sales were disappointing, but Courbet's status as a hero to the French avant-garde became assured. He was admired by the American James McNeill Whistler, and he became an inspiration to the younger generation of French artists including Edouard Manet and the Impressionist painters. The Artist's Studio was recognized as a masterpiece by Delacroix, Baudelaire, and Champfleury, if not by the public.

Context: With the 1335 Treaty of Trentschin and the 1348 Treaty of Namslau, most of the Silesian duchies were ruled by the Silesian Piast dukes under the feudal overlordship of the Bohemian kings, and thus became part of the Crown of Bohemia. In 1476 the Crossen district became part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, when the widow of the Piast ruler, Barbara von Brandenburg, daughter of Elector Albert Achilles, inherited Crossen. In 1526 Silesia was acquired by Austria's Habsburg Monarchy after the death of King Louis II of Bohemia. Brandenburg contested the inheritance, citing a treaty made with Frederick II of Legnica, but Silesia largely remained under Habsburg control until 1742. Question: How many years was Silesia under Habsburg control?

The framing of the question suggests it might be referring to a proverb, rallying cry, popular expression, or some other well-known saying of the time. The sentence provided focuses on a clause within the United States Constitution which technically is not a phrase but a legal provision. Although it may have indirectly influenced the shaping of public discourse and opinion, this clause likely would not have been the everyday language used amongst the public. The clause \\"No state shall... make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts\\" is part of a legal document, the United States Constitution, and is written in legal language. It is a response to the financial issues that troubled the United States in its early years, including the rapid depreciation of paper currency. The founding fathers inserted this clause into the constitution in an attempt to stabilize the currency and promote economic stability. The clause aims to prevent states from issuing their own paper currency, which could potentially become worthless. To ensure a robust and stable economy, it was deemed essential that the states would only accept gold and silver in payment of debts as these have intrinsic value. This measure was intended to protect against bad economic practices, motivate borrowing and lending, and ensure that the value of money remained stable. Hence, the exact reading of the clause from the constitution reflects a policy decision more than a phrase that was \\"heard\\" as a result of depreciating paper money. In conclusion, the question might be better answered by identifying a phrase commonly used by individuals of the period in reaction to or discussion about the depreciation of paper currency. The statement provided can be considered more of a political and legal reaction encoded into the Constitution in response to the economic instability generated by the rapid loss of value in paper money."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 35-page document — made up of a collection of memos filled with explosive claims about the billionaire's relationship to Russia — has reportedly been circulating among journalists and officials for at least a few weeks. But the sourcing on the document is unclear and likely unverifiable. CNN reported that it is based primarily on memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative that were intended as opposition research into Trump. The president-elect on Tuesday night immediately blasted the report, tweeting, \\"FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\\" During the press conference, Trump specifically called out CNN for pushing the story, saying it was \\"disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out.\\" \\"I think it's a disgrace, and I say that, and that's something that Nazi Germany who have done and did do,\\" he said. \\"I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.

Strandloper was based on the story about an English convict who was transported to what country? The answer is:","completion":"The book Strandloper is a historical fiction novel written by the English author Alan Garner. The story was published in 1996 and is based on the true story of William Buckley, an English convict who was transported to Australia in the early 19th century. William Buckley, the central character of the story, was born in Cheshire, England, in 1780. He was a bricklayer who had joined the British army during the Napoleonic Wars. However, his military career was short-lived, as he was convicted of a theft charge in 1803 and was sentenced to transportation to the convict settlement of Port Phillip, which is located in present-day Victoria, Australia. Upon arrival in Australia in 1804, Buckley managed to escape from the convict settlement along with a few other prisoners. He found his way to an Aboriginal group called the Wathaurong people, living in the area around Geelong and the Bellarine Peninsula. Buckley lived with the Wathaurong people for over 30 years, adopting their customs, language, and lifestyle, becoming a respected member of their community. The novel Strandloper explores various themes, such as cultural identity, survival, and personal transformation, as it delves into the experiences of Buckley living among the Wathaurong people. Through the story, Garner attempts to showcase the complex and rich culture of the Australian Aboriginal peoples and their interaction with European settlers. Additionally, the novel highlights the challenges faced by European convicts like Buckley while adapting to the Australian landscape and engaging with its Indigenous peoples. In conclusion, the book Strandloper is based on the true story of an English convict, William Buckley, who was transported to Australia in the early 19th century. Through Buckley's experiences and the cultural complexities of the Aboriginal society, the novel paints a vivid picture of Australia during that period, while also offering an engaging tale of survival and transformation.

What is the title of this article: Spanish explorers traveling inland in the 16th century met Mississippian culture people at Joara, a regional chiefdom near present-day Morganton. Records of Hernando de Soto attested to his meeting with them in 1540. In 1567 Captain Juan Pardo led an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to protect silver mines in Mexico. Pardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed Cuenca. His expedition built Fort San Juan and left a contingent of 30 men there, while Pardo traveled further, and built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to Santa Elena on Parris Island, South Carolina, then a center of Spanish Florida. In the spring of 1568, natives killed all but one of the soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior, including the one at Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera and archaeological findings since 1986 at Joara have confirmed the settlement.

This requires understanding the overall emotion expressed by the user in their text. Step 1: First, I'll look for indicators of positive or negative sentiment, which usually include the use of positive or negative words or phrases. Step 2: Analyzing the review, I note phrases such as \\"I was so excited to eat here\\" and \\"given all the positive reviews\\", which suggest a positive sentiment initially. Step 3: However, the later part of the review contains expressions such as \\"very disappointed\\", \\"overpriced\\", \\"lacking toppings\\", \\"RAW dough\\", \\"executed poorly\\", \\"manager was terribly rude\\", and \\"begrudgingly credited us for the raw pizzas\\". These phrases indicate an overall negative sentiment since they express dissatisfaction and disappointment.

Upon arrival, I was immediately struck by the breathtaking beauty of the resort's location. Nestled between lush rolling hills and a pristine sandy beach, the resort perfectly blended elements of nature, luxury, and relaxation. The impeccably landscaped grounds were dotted with a delightful array of fragrant flowers and tall palm trees, providing ample opportunities for both leisurely strolls and picture-perfect moments. Check-in was a breeze. The genuinely friendly and helpful staff welcomed me with refreshing drinks and cold towels, instantly setting the tone for an unforgettable stay. My room, a sleek and tastefully designed oceanfront suite, boasted a spacious balcony that offered unobstructed views of the sparkling blue sea. The suite was beautifully appointed, with every creature comfort one could desire, including a sumptuous king-sized bed, a large soaking tub, and a well-stocked minibar offering a selection of locally sourced snacks and beverages. The resort's dining options were nothing short of exceptional. Each day began with an abundant breakfast buffet that featured an array of fresh fruits, pastries, and an omelette station manned by a skilled and friendly chef. For lunch and dinner, I thoroughly enjoyed the resort's two on-site restaurants. One was an elegant fine dining establishment specializing in creative, locally inspired dishes, while the other was a more laid-back grill just steps from the beach, offering the most succulent seafood and perfectly grilled meats. Each meal was truly a culinary delight that tantalized my taste buds and left me eagerly anticipating the next. One of the many highlights of my stay at Paradise Resort was the remarkably diverse selection of activities available to guests. While I was mainly interested in relaxing by the beautifully maintained pool or sunbathing on the private stretch of beach, I also had the opportunity to participate in morning yoga classes, explore nearby nature trails, and embark on a dolphin-watching boat excursion. Additionally, the resort provided complimentary equipment for snorkeling and kayaking adventures. With its exceptional service, superb dining experiences, luxurious accommodations, and unparalleled location, my stay at the Paradise Resort proved to be one of the best vacations I have experienced. It truly lives up to its name, providing guests with a serene oasis that perfectly balances luxury and natural beauty.

Options are: * Yes * No Given those answer options, answer the question: If I tell you that Igneous intrusion creates valuable products, and ask you the question \\"what does igneous intrusion create?\\", is the correct answer \\"adding heat\\"? A:","completion":"Igneous intrusion is a geological process where molten magma forces its way through the Earth's crust and solidifies underground, creating various rock formations and contributing to the natural development of various mineral deposits. There are a few valuable products created through this process, including economic resources, distinct geological structures, and a variety of rock types. 1. Economic resources: One of the most significant outcomes of igneous intrusion is the formation of mineral deposits and ores. As the magma cools and solidifies, it can concentrate valuable elements and minerals, like gold, copper, silver, and rare earth elements. These resources are often extracted through mining operations, making igneous intrusion host rock for the extraction of economically important minerals. 2. Geological structures: Igneous intrusions create a variety of geological structures, including dikes, sills, laccoliths, batholiths, and plutons. These geological features provide insight into the Earth's history, tectonic activity, and the distribution of mineral resources. For example, scientists can study these structures to understand how and when the magma intruded, how it interacted with the existing rock layers, and the implications of the intrusion for landscape evolution. 3. Rock types: Igneous intrusions result in the creation of different rock types, depending on the chemical composition and cooling rate of the magma. The most common types of igneous rocks formed through intrusive processes are granite, gabbro, diorite, and peridotite. These rocks can vary in appearance and properties, providing unique opportunities for research, construction, and decorative purposes. While igneous intrusion contributes to processes such as metamorphism wherein rock layers surrounding the intrusion can be altered by added heat and pressure, the correct answer to the question \\"what does igneous intrusion create?\\" is not explicitly \\"adding heat.\\" Instead, a more comprehensive answer would include the creation of valuable economic resources, distinct geological structures, and various rock types, as mentioned above."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

People's activities during their time off from work vary significantly depending on their personal interests, lifestyles, and circumstances. However, among the options provided, taking trips is the most suitable one, as it is a common way for people to spend their leisure time and de-stress. In more detail, during their time off from work, people often aim to detach from their work environment and routine. In this context, taking trips, whether short or long ones, is a popular choice. Traveling provides people with opportunities to explore new places, experience different cultures, and create memories. It also serves as an effective way of relaxation and rejuvenation, allowing people to return to work with a fresh mind and a renewed sense of energy. Though the other options might be applicable in some contexts, they are not as universally fitting.

OPTIONS: I. yes; II. it is not possible to tell; III. no;","completion":"To answer this question, let's examine both sentences closely. Sentence 1: 'This is all the reasonably reliable, reasonably legitimate data on Benny Boy that I could find.' This sentence indicates that the speaker has gathered information or data on \\"Benny Boy\\" and has found at least some information that they consider reasonably reliable and legitimate. The speaker doesn't mention that they didn't know about Benny Boy before conducting the research. Sentence 2: 'I didn't know anything about Benny.' This sentence states that the speaker didn't know anything about Benny. It doesn't specify when they didn't know, though. Now let's analyze the options: I. Yes: This option suggests that both sentences are true, in which case it is possible that the speaker did not know anything about Benny before finding the reasonably reliable, legitimate data. II. It is not possible to tell: This option leaves room for ambiguity and might suggest that we cannot deduce whether the second sentence is true based on the information provided in the first sentence alone. III. No: This option indicates that the second sentence could not be true if the first sentence is true, suggesting that the speaker must have known something about Benny before finding the reasonably reliable, legitimate data. Based on our analysis, the appropriate answer to the question is: II. it is not possible to tell This is because sentence 1 only deals with the current state of the speaker’s knowledge about Benny Boy after conducting research, while sentence 2 doesn't specify the time frame when the speaker didn't know anything about Benny.

In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year. What causes the disease and why is it dangerous? Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters in your mouth. A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth. Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger. A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults. In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet.

The disease is caused by a bacteria C. It cannot be dangerous in any case D. Good hygiene can help prevent the spread of the virus"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A that is responsible for much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defense against eye infections. What can different structure of the cell walls of bacteria effect?","completion":"The different structures of the cell walls of bacteria can greatly influence various aspects of their biological properties, behavior, and interaction with their environment, such as: 1. Classification and identification: The differences in the cell wall structure form the basis for the Gram stain technique, which is a fundamental tool in classifying bacteria as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative and aids in their identification and diagnosis. 2. Pathogenicity and virulence: Gram-negative bacteria possess lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on their outer membrane, which function as endotoxins. These endotoxins can trigger an immune response in the host, leading to inflammation and fever. The presence of teichoic acids in Gram-positive bacteria can also contribute to their pathogenicity by facilitating adherence to host tissues. 3. Antibiotic susceptibility: The variation in cell wall structure affects the ability of some antibiotics to target and kill bacteria effectively. For example, Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to vancomycin, which disrupts the synthesis of peptidoglycan, whereas Gram-negative bacteria are generally more resistant due to their outer membrane acting as a barrier against the antibiotic. Conversely, β-lactam antibiotics, like penicillin, are effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria because they inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links that are critical for the integrity of the bacterial cell wall. 4. Immune response and evasion: Different cell wall components can trigger specific immune responses in the host organism. For instance, LPS in Gram-negative bacteria can activate the host's immune system, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory molecules. However, the presence of capsules around certain Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria can protect them from being detected and targeted by the host's immune system, allowing for evasion and prolonged survival. 5. Environmental adaptation: The cell wall composition and structure may provide specific advantages to bacteria in their environment. For example, the thick layer of peptidoglycan in Gram-positive bacteria can heighten their resistance against osmotic pressure and mechanical stress. Additionally, environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and nutrient availability can impact the composition and properties of the bacterial cell wall, allowing for better adaptation and survival. 6. Cell shape and division: The cell wall plays a crucial role in maintaining the shape and stability of bacterial cells. The differences in cell wall structure can result in variations in cell shape, such as cocci, rods, or spirals, which may affect their motility and ability to colonize specific environments. Additionally, the cell wall is involved in the process of bacterial cell division, with different mechanisms adopted by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, the different structures of bacterial cell walls can significantly influence their classification, pathogenicity, antibiotic susceptibility, immune evasion, environmental adaptation, and overall biology. Understanding these complex interactions can help in the development of more effective antibacterial strategies and provide insights into the diverse and dynamic world of microbial ecosystems."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Information: - Slobozia District (Raionul Slobozia) is an administrative district of Transnistria, Moldova. It is the southernmost district of Transnistria, located mostly south of Tiraspol. Its seat is the city of Slobozia, located at , on the river Dniester. The district contains 4 cities/towns and 12 communes (a total of 24 localities, including small villages/hamlets): - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - Tîrnauca (Romanian \\"Ternivka\\", , \\"Ternovka\\") is a commune and village in the Slobozia District of Transnistria, Moldova, situated on the east bank of the river Dniester, between Tighina and Tiraspol. It is notable for being home to the largest bottle-shaped building in the world, the Butylka hotel and museum. - A is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features a large number of extremely small \\"rooms\\" (capsules) intended to provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require the services offered by more conventional hotels. - Tiraspol (Russian and ) is internationally recognised as the second largest city in Moldova, but is effectively the capital and administrative centre of the unrecognised Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria). The city is located on the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Tiraspol is a regional hub of light industry, such as furniture and electrical goods production. - Butylka ( Russian for bottle ) is the name of a museum and hotel , sometimes also called the Spirit Museum Hotel . It is located in the village Tîrnauca ( Ternovka ) , 10 km from Tiraspol , the capital of Transnistria . The museum is notable for being housed inside a five - story structure shaped like a giant bottle . It is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest building in the world in the shape of a bottle . The museum features owner Grigory Korzun 's vast collection of liquor . - The Dniester River, or Dnister River ( translit. \\"Dnister\\", , ) is a river in Eastern Europe. It runs first through Ukraine and then through Moldova (from which it separates the breakaway territory of Transnistria), finally discharging into the Black Sea on Ukrainian territory again. - Moldavia (or \\"\\", Romanian Cyrillic alphabet: ) is a historical region, and former principality in Eastern Europe, corresponding to the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester river. An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with Wallachia as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak) and all of Bukovina. - A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a fridge and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities. - A bottle is a rigid container with a neck that is narrower than the body and a mouth. By contrast, a jar has a relatively large mouth or opening which may be as wide as the overall container. Bottles are often made of glass, clay, plastic, aluminium or other impervious materials, and typically used to store liquids such as water, milk, soft drinks, beer, wine, cooking oil, medicine, shampoo, ink, and chemicals. A device applied in the bottling line to seal the mouth of a bottle is termed an external bottle cap, closure, or internal stopper. A bottle can also be sealed by a conductive \\"innerseal\\" by using induction sealing. - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public. - Transnistria (Moldovan: ), officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR ); also called Transdniester, Trans-Dniestr, Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, is a self-proclaimed republic on a strip of land between the River Dniester and the border with Ukraine, recognised only by three non-United Nations (UN) states. The region is considered by the UN to be part of Moldova. The PMR controls most of the territory to the east of the River Dniester, and also the city of Bender and its surrounding localities on the west bank, in the historical region of Bessarabia. - Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu. - Bessarabia (; \\"Bessarabiya\\"; \\"Besarabiya\\") is a historical region in Eastern Europe, bounded by the Dniester river on the east and the Prut river on the west. Today Bessarabia is mostly occupied by modern-day Moldova, with the Ukrainian Budjak region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian Chernivtsi Oblast covering a small area in the north. - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. - Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red. Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.

A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest; upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened. Both men were then summoned to testify in court, where they met the captured bandit TajÅmaru (å¤è¥ä¸¸), who claimed responsibility for killing the samurai and raping his wife. The bandit's story[edit] TajÅmaru (Toshiro Mifune), a notorious brigand, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but was eventually \\"seduced\\" by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. TajÅmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In TajÅmaru's recollection they fought skillfully and fiercely, but in the end TajÅmaru was the victor and the woman ran away. At the end of the story to the court, he is asked about an expensive dagger owned by the samurai's wife: he says that, in the confusion, he forgot all about it, and that it was foolish of him to leave behind such a valuable object.

Question: suppose more plants and die died happens, how will it affect MORE oil. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"To answer the question, let's break down the process step-by-step and analyze the impact of more plants and animals dying on each step: 1. Plants and animals long ago died: If more plants and animals die, it could potentially result in a greater amount of organic material available for the formation of oil. 2. They are buried under layers of soil: With more organic material from dead plants and animals, the layers of soil covering them might also increase, resulting in deeper burial. 3. Pressure builds over time: Deeper burial may lead to higher pressure exerted on the dead organic material from the layers of soil above them. 4. The remains liquefy: With increased pressure, the chances of the organic remains liquefying might increase, promoting the formation of oil. 5. The carbon atoms rearrange to become a new substance: If there is a greater amount of liquefied organic material, more carbon atoms will rearrange to form oil. Based on this analysis, the supposed perturbation of more plants and animals dying will likely result in MORE oil being formed. However, this increase might not necessarily be linear, as other factors, like the rate at which organic material is buried and the geological conditions, might also play a role in the formation of oil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music. At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005 with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be \\"featured with\\" Queen as \\"Queen + Paul Rodgers\\", not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating. In November 2004, Queen were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and the award ceremony was the first event at which Rodgers joined May and Taylor as vocalist. Between 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, which was the first time Queen toured since their last tour with Freddie Mercury in 1986. The band's drummer Roger Taylor commented; \\"We never thought we would tour again, Paul [Rodgers] came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer. He's not trying to be Freddie.\\" The first leg was in Europe, the second in Japan, and the third in the US in 2006. Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 25 May 2006. The Foo Fighters paid homage to the band in performing \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" to open the ceremony before being joined on stage by May, Taylor, and Paul Rodgers, who played a selection of Queen hits. On 15 August 2006, Brian May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a \\"secret location\\". Queen + Paul Rodgers performed at the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute held in Hyde Park, London on 27 June 2008, to commemorate Mandela's ninetieth birthday, and again promote awareness of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The first Queen + Paul Rodgers album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the release of the album, the band again went on a tour through Europe, opening on Kharkiv's Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans. The Kharkiv concert was later released on DVD. The tour then moved to Russia, and the band performed two sold-out shows at the Moscow Arena. Having completed the first leg of its extensive European tour, which saw the band play 15 sold-out dates across nine countries, the UK leg of the tour sold out within 90 minutes of going on sale and included three London dates, the first of which was The O2 on 13 October. The last leg of the tour took place in South America, and included a sold-out concert at the Estadio Jose Amalfitani, Buenos Aires. Queen and Paul Rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 May 2009.

The display of raw emotion showcases the decades-old wounds that Bulger's alleged crimes have left on the families of his victims. James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, infamous for his involvement in organized crime, has been charged with several counts, including murder, racketeering, and drug trafficking. As the trial continues, friends and family members of the victims have become increasingly frustrated with the proceedings. The widow, visibly shaken and angry, shouted toward Bulger as she disrupted the trial. Her son later told reporters, \\"He is going to take his secrets to the grave with him.\\" The pain and anguish caused by the loss of a loved one at the hands of a brutal criminal is evident in these powerful words. Bulger, noticeably unfazed by the interruption, responded to the judge with a dismissive, \\"This is a sham. Do what ya's want with me.\\" His nonchalance in the face of the emotional turmoil surrounding the case offers a chilling insight into the mind of a man who has been extensively involved in criminal activity. In an unexpected move, Bulger has offered assets of nearly 822,000 to the victims' families if he is convicted of the charges against him. Many have questioned the motives behind this generous offer, as some see this action as an attempt to regain public support or alleviate guilt. However, it is undeniable that this financial assistance could provide some level of comfort to the family members who have endured severe heartache following the untimely deaths of their loved ones. The heated exchanges between the accused mobster and the victims' families paint a vivid picture of the emotional intensity that has come to define this trial. As evidence continues to stack up against Bulger, it remains to be seen whether he will indeed take his secrets to the grave or face justice. Not only does the story of James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger bring attention to the deeply rooted issues in the world of organized crime, but it also serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of such atrocities. Displaying resilience and determination, the families of Bulger's alleged victims stand strong and united against the man who has caused them so much pain and sorrow. In conclusion, the trial of James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger continues to captivate the nation as a harrowing and profound testimony to the consequences of a life led on the wrong side of the law. As the drama unfolds, one can only hope that justice will be served for the victims' families and that the truth will be unveiled, providing closure and allowing for healing to begin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: neurons talk each other through Context: The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Looking to buy a home? It’s better to be on a “Way” than a “Street,” pick a female real-estate agent and try to be close to a Starbucks. That’s the advice of Spencer Rascoff, CEO of Zillow.com, who collected statistics from his site’s database of 110 million homes to find trends in real-estate pricing. Along with Zillow economist Stan Humphries, he has written “The New Rules of Real Estate” (Grand Central), out Tuesday. Some of his findings: The Starbucks effect. Take two identical homes sold in 1997. One near Starbucks would have sold for an average of 137,000, while the same home without a Starbucks would have sold for 102,000. Fast-forward 15 years: the average US home appreciated 65 percent to 168,000, but the property next to Starbucks skyrockets 96 percent to 269,000. All renovations are not created equal. The greatest return for your investment is a mid-range bathroom remodel, a 3,000 job that returns 1.71 for every dollar spent. The worst home improvements for value are kitchen remodeling and finishing a basement. A top-of-the-line kitchen reno will cost you 22,000, and you’ll only get about 0.51 back for every 1 you spend. Use the right words in a listing. Avoid “unique,” “TLC,” “investment” and “potential” — these could lower sale prices by as much as 7 percent. But words like “luxurious” for bottom-tier homes and “captivating” for top-tier homes could add 8.2 percent to your home’s value. Longer, more-detailed listings often sell for more. “When” is as important as “how much.” In New York, the worst time to sell is the second week of December (listings sold for 2.8 percent less than average). The best time is March, when homes sold faster and for 2 percent more. Seven is an unlucky number. Homes with “777” as their address sell for 2.1 percent less than their estimated value; house numbers that just include 777 (such as 17779 Main St.), sell for 1.8 percent less. Oddly, houses with just 7 as their number sell for 1.8 percent more than the estimated sale price. Psychological pricing works. Listings with a nine in the thousand digit (450,000 vs. 449,000) sell anywhere from four days to a full week faster. Female agents tend to sell homes faster and for higher prices. ||||| What fuels gentrification? The answer is the same thing that fuels the rest of us: coffee. But not just any old cup o’ joe. Starbucks, the iconic coffee roaster and retailer, has grown into a 15 billion company, with more than 19,000 locations in more than 60 countries. You can spot that familiar green-and-white logo from Saudi Arabia to Switzerland, in a Dubai shopping mall, or on a Carnival Cruise ship. Where the Berlin Wall once stood, there’s a shiny new Starbucks instead. Conveniently, one of our desks has a view of the original Starbucks store in Pike Place Market. Starbucks’ mission is “to inspire and nurture the human spirit—one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.” Any college student downing venti caramel macchiatos to stay awake the night before a big exam can testify to Starbucks’, in a word, nurturing qualities. But as it turns out, Starbucks correlates with something else, too: rising home values. To explore exactly how closely the two correlate, we compared a database of Starbucks locations with Zillow data. And since Starbucks’ corporate headquarters in Seattle is located just a few miles down the road from Zillow, we also took the opportunity to pay our neighbors a visit, and to pick the brains of Starbucks’ own real estate analytics team—the whizzes who determine where to put that next Starbucks location. Here’s what we can tell you: Starbucks equates with venti-sized home-value appreciation. Moreover, Starbucks seems to be fueling—not following—these higher home values. And the reason why is that Starbucks’ real estate choices are, in their words, “as much an art as a science.” When deciding where to hang its next shingle, the company marries right-brain ingenuity with hard-headed, left-brain analysis—exactly as you should. Let’s take these fresh-brewed insights one at a time. Starbucks equals big bucks Although some may scoff that the predictive value of a given retail chain doesn’t mean much, locations near Starbucks are, indisputably, highly lucrative. True, properties near Starbucks locations tend to start out more expensive. But as you can see, these properties appreciate at a faster rate than US housing on the whole. Interestingly, they’re also recovering much more quickly from the housing bust. What does that look like in practice? Let’s look at the historical home value appreciation of areas that now are located within a quarter mile of a Starbucks. A home that is now near a Starbucks would have sold, on average, for 137,000. A home that is not near a Starbucks would have sold, on average, for 102,000. Fast-forward 17 years to 2014. That average American home has now appreciated 65%, to 168,000. But the Starbucks-adjacent property has far outpaced that, appreciating 96% to 269,000. Starbucks is the fuel, not the follower “Try some decaf,” you may be thinking. “Home prices rise and fall for a lot of reasons. How do we know this has anything to do with Starbucks?” For instance, maybe this isn’t a Starbucks Effect at all. Maybe it’s just a coffeeshop effect. To examine that possibility, we took a look at another prominent coffee chain, Dunkin’ Donuts. What did we learn? Homes near Dunkin’ Donuts reflect a similar historical trend. But while they appreciate faster than the nation’s housing as a whole, they still don’t appreciate as fast as properties that are now a quarter-mile from a Starbucks. In fact, between 1997 and 2012, homes now located near Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts followed similar historical trajectories, substantially outpacing the overall home value appreciation. But their paths diverged during the recent housing recovery such that, today, homes near Dunkin’ Donuts have appreciated 80% since 1997 whereas homes near Starbucks have appreciated 96%, almost doubling their value. Even so, you may be saying, is it possible that the Starbucks Effect is really just a coastal effect? Or an urban effect? Maybe people really like living in Seattle and Boston, and the Starbucks locations dotting their neighborhoods are just incidental. We wondered this, too. After all, when we looked at a map of Starbucks locations in the United States, it’s readily apparent that historically they have clustered on the coasts, in the Midwest, and in urban areas. Moreover, maybe Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts are just waiting for a neighborhood’s property values to heat up before moving in and setting up shop. What’s to say that Starbucks is the cause, rather than a consequence, of higher home values? To attempt to rule out these possibilities, we tracked values of homes in a very tight ring within a quarter mile of Starbucks (so close you could practically smell the dark roast from your front porch) and compared those very-Starbucks-adjacent homes to houses slightly farther away, in a ring of homes between a quarter- and a half-mile from a Starbucks. And we compared home values in these two rings (adjacent and nearby) for only the five years after the Starbucks location actually opened, in order to see whether the effect took place after the opening or already existed before the store opened. Lo and behold, the adjacent homes beat out the nearby homes. Those houses closest to Starbucks appreciated a little more than 21% over five years, while the houses slightly farther away only appreciated just less than 17%. So, yes, some of the difference is related to the location itself, but there’s still a healthy difference attributable to the arrival of a Starbucks. Whatever the reasons—because they genuinely like drinking coffee, or because they see Starbucks as a proxy for gentrification—it seems pretty clear that people are paying a premium for homes near Starbucks. And furthermore, it looks like Starbucks itself is driving the increase in home values. Picking locations—An art and a science Armed with this data, we headed down Seattle’s First Avenue to Starbucks HQ. There, we had the pleasure of chatting with Arthur Rubinfeld, who oversees Starbucks’ location selection process, and his extremely talented team. We asked them, is the Starbucks Effect the product of careful, data-driven decisions on their part? And their answer was, more or less, yes. The Starbucks team explained that while they have 20 or so analytics experts around the world poring over maps and geographic information systems data—assessing factors like an area’s traffic patterns and businesses—the company also empowers dozens of regional teams to come to their own conclusions about location, store design, and a host of other issues. Yet, even with their reams of data and locally-driven decision making, our Starbucks friends noted that there was no single silver bullet. “The beauty of Starbucks is our understanding of real-estate site locationing,” Arthur told us. “It’s an art and a science.” We couldn’t have put it better ourselves. There have been times and places—like before the financial crisis, when Starbucks bet on an up-and-coming Seattle commercial area that never materialized—where the art of site location is displayed in all of its messiness. In other instances, the science has delivered big-time returns. Ultimately, one Starbucks pro told us, “We try to provide consistency in the science… so that local decision makers have everything they need at their fingertips to make easy decisions.” Indeed, at the end of the day, where you buy a home is based on countless subjective factors. As in Moby-Dick—whose pages gave us the first mate Starbuck and inspired the Starbucks name—finding that perfect, ahead-of-the- curve home can sometimes seem like chasing your very own white whale. But some factors can make that search a little bit easier. So grab a venti skim latte—hey, get the extra shot—and go find the right home for you.

Other factors that can potentially alter the structure of a nucleotide include: 1. Oxidation reaction: Oxidative stress can cause damage to DNA, resulting in changes to nucleotide structure through reactions with reactive oxygen species (ROS). This can lead to the formation of modified bases and strand breaks. 2. Adding heat: High temperatures can cause DNA denaturation, in which the hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases break, and the double-stranded DNA molecule unwinds into two separate single strands. While this process does not directly modify the nucleotide structure, it might make the DNA more susceptible to damage or other reactions when the DNA strands are separated. Water, name, permineralization, and air are not factors that directly change the structure of nucleotides. However, it is important to note that environmental factors, such as humidity (related to water content in the air) or temperature (which can be influenced by air or water) can indirectly impact the stability and integrity of DNA molecules.

Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Peculiar Insight into the Incriminating Investigation of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab\\" Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, an infamous Nigerian terrorist, received consequential legal retribution for his notorious criminal acts, resulting from an exhaustive investigative procedure conducted by diligent and meticulous agents. Driving deep into the heart of Abdulmutallab's intentions, investigators discovered a riveting truth that suggested the scope of Abdulmutallab's plans and affiliation with the infamous terror outfit, al-Qaeda. The agents who carried out the investigation into Abdulmutallab reported an intriguing detail about him, he was exceptionally forthcoming about his radical plans. The revelation sent shockwaves across the global intelligence community not only because of the audacity of the planned act, but also for his unusual willingness to share details. Typically, individuals involved in such actions are trained to withstand questioning and carry little to no information that could compromise their mission. However, in the case of Abdulmutallab, this traditional defense mechanism seemed conspicuously absent. His ready confession and disclosure of his plans provided crucial information that helped authorities to delve deeper into the nefarious web of al-Qaeda. Abdulmutallab, showing no signs of remorse, pleaded guilty earlier this year. His admission of guilt led to him being sentenced to three life terms, marking a significant victory for justice and the relentless fight against global terrorism. The severity of the sentence mirrored the enormity of the crime he planned to commit – an orchestrated act of terror that could have claimed countless lives. A startling revelation in the investigation was the potential involvement of Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, the infamous al-Qaeda bombmaker. Al-Asiri is known for his adeptness in creating compact and powerful explosive devices, often designed to bypass common detection methods. Investigators claimed that evidence pointed towards al-Asiri as the architect of the device intended for Abdulmutallab’s mission. The collaboration between Abdulmutallab, a man willing to lay his life for the destructive cause, and al-Asiri, an expert bomb-maker, all under the auspices of al-Qaeda, represented an alarming threat that the intelligence community were now better prepared to face. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, unanimously remembered by the enormity of his planned crime and the promptness of his confession, will serve as a stark reminder of the looming threats that nations confront. It has also underscored the criticality of thorough investigative efforts in unravelling complex terror plots and connections. Now, more than ever before, the nexus between Abdulmutallab and al-Asiri highlights the importance of international cooperation in both intelligence gathering and sharing, to thwart similar threats in the future. In conclusion, the sentencing of Abdulmutallab offers a semblance of closure, but the darkness of the threat he embodied still lurks in the shadows of global security. There is a pressing need for increased vigilance and developing smarter, robust counter-terrorism tactics. Abdulmutallab's case, therefore, not only represents a closure but also serves as a crucial lesson for the reinforcement of global security strategies moving forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jeffrey could not bend over to retrieve items unlike Adam because","completion":"of a severe spinal injury he had sustained a few years back in a tragic car accident. The accident had left Jeffrey with a fused spine, rendering him incapable of bending or twisting like he used to. The days when Jeffrey could perform his daily activities without assistance were gone, and he was forced to adapt to a new way of living. Adam, Jeffrey's kind-hearted and caring younger brother, keenly observed Jeffrey's struggles and often wondered how to bring some ease into his life. During his free time, Adam researched about spinal injuries, its consequences, and various techniques to support his brother in leading a more comfortable life. He read about different tools and gadgets that could potentially aid Jeffrey in accomplishing seemingly simple tasks, such as picking up objects from the ground. One day, as Jeffrey sat in his wheelchair in the living room, Adam entered with a sense of excitement in his eyes. Jeffrey noted this curiosity but remained silent, waiting for Adam to reveal what he had discovered. Adam pulled a long stick-like apparatus with a claw at the end from behind his back. It was a reacher grabber tool designed to help people with limited mobility pick up and retrieve objects from difficult-to-reach places. \\"I've found the perfect solution!\\" Adam exclaimed as he demonstrated the tool to Jeffrey. Slowly letting the understanding of the concept dawn upon Jeffrey. \\"You can now pick up items without having to bend, twist, or rely on someone else. This could bring some independence back into your life.\\" Jeffrey's eyes lit up with hope as he watched Adam deftly lift a book from the ground using the tool. He never allowed himself to lose faith that there could be a life beyond his debilitating spinal injury. Motivated by his brother's ingenuity and relentless optimism, Jeffrey grew more determined to regain as much ground as his condition would allow. Over the subsequent weeks, the brothers experimented with the reacher grabber, refining their techniques and getting additional attachments that could help Jeffrey perform specific tasks with ease. Motivated by this breakthrough, they researched other accessibility devices, including raised toilet seats, ergonomic cushions, and motorized wheelchairs to further improve Jeffrey's quality of life. Jeffrey's self-confidence began to grow. With every incremental improvement, he felt a renewed sense of hope, inspired in part by his brother's unwavering belief in his capabilities. The bond between the two brothers only grew stronger as they faced these challenges together. Their determination to adapt and find innovative ways to overcome obstacles was a testimony to the power of love, collaboration, and resilience in the face of adversity. Rather than allowing his injury to dictate the terms of his life, Jeffrey began to see a new horizon packed with fresh opportunities to reinvent himself. He learned to appreciate the simpler things in life, finding joy in moments shared with his supportive family and friends, and absorbing the beauty of the world around him. Though he may never recover the full function of his spine, Jeffrey emerged as a living testament to the indomitable spirit that many such individuals possess. And in the end, it became clear that while Jeffrey could not bend over to retrieve items unlike Adam, he was more than capable of overcoming his challenges, embracing his new reality, and living a rich and fulfilling life - all with Adam by his side."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Giants opened the regular season against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday night, September 10. In a highly anticipated matchup that was nicknamed \\"Manning Bowl I\\", quarterback Eli Manning had to lead his Giants against his older brother, quarterback Peyton Manning, and the Colts. The Giants fell behind early as Peyton led the Colts on a 17-play, 58-yard drive that ate up 8:53, ending with kicker Adam Vinatieri hitting a 26-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Colts would build their lead with a 32-yard Vinatieri field goal, and after Jay Feely missed a 40-yard field goal wide left for the Giants, Peyton Manning found tight end Dallas Clark on a 2-yard touchdown pass. Down 13-0, and starting at their own 14-yard line with 2:18 to play in the half, the Giants' offense woke up, with Eli completing a 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Plaxico Burress with 40 seconds to play in the half. But that was a little too much time left on the clock: The Colts would end the first half with Vinatieri kicking a 48-yard field goal. On the opening drive of the second half, the Giants continued their momentum from the first half, as Eli completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey, completing an 11-play, 69-yard drive that ate up 7:50. After the teams traded punts, Peyton Manning was intercepted by R.W. McQuarters, but Eli Manning fumbled, and the ball was recovered by Robert Mathis. On the ensuing drive, running back Dominic Rhodes scored from 1 yard out to open up a 23-14 lead with 13:21 to play. Undaunted, the Giants would then respond with a 1-yard touchdown run of their own from running back Brandon Jacobs. The Giants forced a punt on the next possession, but longtime Indianapolis punter Hunter Smith pinned the Giants at their own 7 with 4:58 to go. On that drive, Tim Carter was whistled for a questionable pass-interference call, negating a 19-yard reception for a first down. On the next play, Eli Manning was picked off by Nick Harper.

Nacre, also known as mother of pearl, is an organic-inorganic composite material produced by some mollusks as an inner shell layer. It is strong, resilient, and iridescent, making it highly valued for its unique aesthetic qualities. Mother of pearl is formed primarily by oysters, abalones, and some other bivalve mollusks. The mollusk secretes a substance called calcium carbonate, which forms layers on the inner surface of the shell. As layers accumulate, nacre is formed. The intricate, repetitive structure of these layers gives nacre its iridescence, reflecting light in a way that creates a beautiful play of colors. The name \\"mother of pearl\\" stems from the fact that this material is the source of pearls. Pearls are formed when an irritant, such as a grain of sand, gets trapped inside the mollusk's shell. To protect itself from the irritant, the mollusk coats the foreign object with the same substance used to create its shell, which eventually forms a pearl. Thus, mother of pearl is considered the \\"mother\\" or origin of pearls. Mother of pearl has been used throughout history for various decorative and functional purposes. In ancient Egypt, it was incorporated into jewelry, furniture, and even sarcophagi. In Asia, it was popularly used for intricate inlays in furniture, lacquerware, and other decorative items. Mother of pearl continues to be highly sought after for its natural beauty, and it is often used in luxurious artisan creations such as jewelry, watch faces, and guitar inlays. In addition to its aesthetic value, mother of pearl has unique physical properties that make it ideal for various practical uses. It is strong and lightweight, making it suitable for use in advanced materials science applications, such as lightweight composites for aerospace constructions. The microstructure of nacre has also inspired researchers to develop biomimetic materials with similar mechanical properties, which could have potential in a variety of industries. In conclusion, the common name for nacre is mother of pearl, a lustrous and iridescent material produced by mollusks for the formation of their inner shell. This beautiful material has been cherished and utilized for thousands of years, both for its aesthetic qualities and its functional properties. From ancient artifacts to modern applications in the high-tech industries, mother of pearl continues to be a material of intrigue and fascination."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Options: - kitchen - supermarket - table - stomach - restaurant Answer:","completion":"The best place to make food, considering the options provided, is undoubtedly the kitchen. The kitchen is specifically designed and equipped for the purpose of preparing and cooking food. It usually contains all the necessary appliances, tools, and surfaces required to make a variety of dishes, and is the hub of culinary activity in most households and commercial spaces. Compared to the other options you have provided, the kitchen is the most logical choice. Let's take a look at why the other options are less suitable: - Supermarket: While a supermarket is a great place to purchase ingredients for preparing and cooking food, it is not intended for the actual process of making food. Although some supermarkets may house small food preparation stations or delis, their primary function is to sell groceries and other goods, meaning their facilities for making food are limited. - Table: A table is generally used for serving and consuming food after it has been prepared. While it is possible to do some minor food preparation tasks on a table, such as cutting bread or assembling a sandwich, the limited space and lack of appropriate tools and appliances make it an unsuitable choice for cooking or making most dishes. - Stomach: The stomach serves an entirely different purpose in relation to food; it is responsible for breaking down the food we consume through the digestive process. Food has already been prepared and consumed by the time it reaches the stomach, so it cannot be considered a place where we make food. - Restaurant: Although a restaurant is a place where food is made and served, it is not accessible to everyone as it is often considered a commercial establishment, and therefore, not everyone can go into a restaurant kitchen and make their own food. The primary purpose of restaurants is to serve customers with prepared dishes, and not to provide a space for everyone to make their own food. In summary, a kitchen is the most appropriate choice for making food among the options given.

Possible A: dead, construction site, under ground, egypt, cemetary Why is \\"cemetary\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Cemetery\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in the context of the question because it connects well with the themes and concepts mentioned in the question. There are several factors that make \\"cemetery\\" a sensible answer choice. 1. Relevance to the case: The question deals with a murder case. A cemetery is directly related to death, and it is a common final resting place for those who have lost their lives, including murder victims. 2. Connection to reopening the case: When the judge decides that the murder case can be reopened, it suggests that new information or evidence might have come to light. This could mean that there might be a need to exhume a body or look for additional evidence in a burial site. A cemetery would be a logical place to start this process, as it is where bodies are often interred, and new evidence might be discovered during the excavation. 3. Suitability for excavation: Of the possible answers given, a cemetery is a location where excavation is more likely to be carried out in the context of a murder investigation. Excavating other sites like a construction site, underground facility, or in Egypt may not be directly related to the case, could have legal implications, and might involve unrelated parties. Excavating a cemetery would be more focused on the matter at hand, with a higher likelihood of yielding pertinent evidence or information. 4. Commonness of events: Although it is not an everyday occurrence, the exhumation of a body for further investigation in a criminal case is not unheard of. In high-profile or complex murder cases, where new evidence emerges, it is feasible that the authorities may need to exhume a body to carry out forensic examinations. Given this context, it is more aligned with human understanding and common sense that a cemetery would be the site of excavation in a reopened murder case. By considering these factors, it becomes clear that \\"cemetery\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense because it is consistent with the concepts, themes, and actions presented in the question. It represents a logical and suitable location for the progression of a murder case and relates well to the circumstances mentioned in the question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: From the Zara cornflower blue dress she wore after announcing her engagement to the vibrant pink jeans she wore to play hockey in ahead of London's Olympics, whatever the Duchess of Cambridge wears generally turns to retail gold. Her wardrobe choices used to send high street sales soaring with shoppers desperate to emulate her impeccable style. But is the 32-year-old losing her touch? Seemingly so, if the latest research is anything to go by. According to a new survey women are more likely to copy reality TV stars such as Made In Chelsea's Binky Felstead, TOWIE's Lauren Pope and Jersey Shore's Snooki than the once-favoured royal. Scroll down for video. Are we over her? A new piece of research reveals that the 'Kate effect' isn't as strong as it once was and women are more influenced by reality TV stars when it comes to fashion. So is the Kate effect over? Apparently so, according to Jeetendr Sehdev, a celebrity branding expert and University of Southern California marketing professor writing for WWD. He found that movie stars, musicians, models and reality TV stars yield greater influence when it comes to fashion than the former Kate Middleton. According to his research, women in both the USA and the UK claim to be more influenced by reality TV stars, including the Kardashians, as well as Taylor Swift, Sienna Miller and Michelle Obama. Kate who? The survey found that Lauren Pope, left, from The Only Way is Essex, and Binky Felstead, right, from Made in Chelsea, scored higher as fashion influencers. First lady of fashion: According to his research, women in both the USA and the UK claim to be more influenced by the likes of Michelle Obama, left, and Taylor Swift, right. So influential is the First Lady that she has 11 times more selling power than the Duchess. Speaking about his results, Sehdev said: 'Her influence is not what it’s being made to be and, in the eyes of the modern woman in both the U.S. and the U.K., she’s not heralded in that way. 'Does she even deserve the title of style icon? The answer is no, because she doesn’t measure on the criteria of the style icon.' So why has the new mother fallen out of favour? While 68 per cent of those surveyed believe her style has a certain timelessness, Michelle Obama is seen to be fives time as daring in her dressing. Sehdev also believes that Kate's move from high street offerings such as Reiss and L.K. Bennett to designer garments such as Alexander McQueen means her style resonate less with the masses. 'Style icons today have to be enormously sexy and they have to have a great sense of style and fashion and flair and individuality and they also have to be dressing for themselves and not others,' Sehdev added. Her best fashion moments: From the Zara cornflower blue dress she wore after announcing her engagement, right, to the vibrant pink jeans she wore to play hockey in, left, whatever the Duchess of Cambridge touches turned to gold when the Kate effect was in full swing.

Step 1: Analyze the actions taken by Apple Farm Apple Farm started an agroforestry system and adopted other methods to protect their depleted soils. Agroforestry involves growing trees or shrubs in combination with crops or pastureland, which can offer various benefits, such as the prevention of soil erosion, maintaining soil fertility, and providing a diverse habitat for wildlife. While agroforestry doesn't explicitly mention the use of cover crops, some agroforestry practices can incorporate them to enhance soil health. Step 2: Analyze the actions taken by Pear Farm Pear Farm did not take any measures to address their depleted soils and experienced significant losses in the following years. Since no specific actions are mentioned, it's difficult to determine if Pear Farm used any cover crops or not. Step 3: Compare cover crop usage between the two farms Based on the information provided, Apple Farm actively implemented agroforestry practices and possibly used cover crops as part of their approach to improve their depleted soils. Conversely, Pear Farm did not take any specific actions to address their soil depletion. Given that Pear Farm did not implement any techniques to improve its soil health, it is safe to assume that Apple Farm likely used more cover crops, leaving Pear Farm with fewer.

Kate Anderson became an accidental car thief when picking up her daughter's car near an Ohio University building last week. Anderson spotted the Toyota Camry and used her daughter's key to unlock the car, start the engine and drive home-without realizing that the car wasn't her daughter's. When Charlie Vansant left class a short time later, he found only an empty parking spot. He first assumed the car had been _ , but when the police couldn't find a record of it, they took a theft report.

Anderson said she was able to find Vansant's name on paperwork in the glove compartment and look up his phone number on the website for the university.

As the country endured another sodden week, following the wettest spring and early summer period since records began, it emerged that the wet weather will continue for another seven to 10 days. Matt Dobson, forecaster at MeteoGroup, said the main culprit was the jet stream, a fast wind that blows round the planet and moves our surface pressure systems. Sales of a 'mood boosting' supplement have increased drastically because of the terrible Britain weather, figures suggest. The gloomy and dreary weather conditions have likely contributed to an overall decrease in mood and energy levels among the population. As a result, people are seeking various ways to lift their spirits, including turning to mood-enhancing supplements. These supplements often contain ingredients such as St. John's Wort, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids, which have been proven to help improve mood, cognitive function, and overall mental health. With the ongoing rain and lack of sunshine, it comes as no surprise that individuals are looking for alternative ways to brighten their days. In addition to supplements, people are also finding other methods to cope with the unfavorable weather. Indoor activities, exercise, and maintaining social connections can provide much-needed relief and help combat feelings of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or the \\"winter blues.\\" As the nation prepares for the Olympics, the pressure is on for the weather to improve and provide both athletes and spectators with a more enjoyable experience. However, as long as the jet stream continues to cause havoc on the British climate, the search for remedies to combat its effects on mental well-being will remain essential for many. In conclusion, the relentless downpours and dreary conditions resulting from the jet stream have prompted a drastic increase in the sales of mood-boosting supplements. As people search for ways to improve their mental state in the face of such adverse weather conditions, it is essential that everyone prepares for the possibilities of more torrential rains throughout the summer and potentially into the start of the Olympics.

Jan Brewer will likely veto politically-charged legislation that supporters say promotes religious freedom and opponents contend discriminates against gays and lesbians. Brewer did not signal her intention either way in an exclusive interview with CNN on Monday at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington. \\"I can assure you, as always, I will do the right thing for the state of Arizona,\\" she said. But some Arizona Republicans who know her well say they are confident those comments mean Brewer will almost surely reject the bill that is generating nationwide controversy. The Republican-led measure would allow Arizona business owners to deny service to gay and lesbian customers as long as they assert their religious beliefs. Brewer is scheduled to return to Arizona on Tuesday, and a source tells CNN those familiar with her thinking say she will likely spend at least one full business day in the state before acting. \\"I'm going to go home, and when I receive the bill, I'm going to read it and I'm going to be briefed on it. We have been following it. And I will make my decision in the near future,\\" Brewer told CNN. She has until Saturday to sign or veto the bill. If she does nothing, it automatically becomes law. Arizona GOP sources say Brewer considers herself a pro-business governor -- someone who above all else wants to protect and promote Arizona's economic interests. They say she knows full well there will be economic consequences for the state if it has a law on the books perceived to effectively codify discrimination. \\"I have a history of deliberating and having an open dialogue on bills that are controversial, to listen to both sides of those issues, and I welcome the input, and information that they can provide to me. And certainly I am pro-business, and that is what's turning our economy around, so I appreciate their input, as I appreciate the other side,\\" Brewer said. Business leaders in Arizona and around the country, including the chief executive of American Airlines, have urged Brewer publicly and privately to veto the bill. Approval also is likely to trigger lawsuits. The bill was pushed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a conservative group opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. The group argues the proposal protects people against increasingly activist federal courts. Brewer vetoed a similar bill last year, arguing that the state legislature should focus on more pressing issues, such as a Medicaid expansion plan she was promoting. Sources say she is concerned about this bill taking away from other issues she is now pressing, such as overhauling Arizona's child protective services system. Freedom or oppression? That's the question for Arizona's SB1062. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Arizona Gov.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Background: Jan Zizka z Trocnova a Kalicha (Czech pronunciation: ['jan 'ZISka] ( listen); German: Johann Ziska; English: John Zizka of Trocnov and the Chalice) was a Czech general, a contemporary and follower of Jan Hus, Hussite military leader, and later also a Radical Hussite who led the Taborites. Zizka is held to be one of the most renowned military leaders by many historians and today he is widely considered a Czech national hero. He was born in the small village of Trocnov (now part of Borovany) in the Kingdom of Bohemia into an aristocratic family. Context: Zizka helped develop tactics of using wagon forts, called vozova hradba in Czech or Wagenburg by the Germans, as mobile fortifications. When the Hussite army faced a numerically superior opponent they prepared carts for the battle by forming them into squares or circles. The carts were joined wheel to wheel by chains and positioned aslant, with their corners attached to each other, so that horses could be harnessed to them quickly, if necessary. In front of this wall of carts a ditch was dug by camp followers. The crew of each cart consisted of 16-22 soldiers: 4-8 crossbowmen, 2 handgunners, 6-8 soldiers equipped with pikes or flails (the flail was the Hussite \\"national weapon\\"), 2 shield carriers and 2 drivers. The Hussites' battle consisted of two stages, the first defensive, the second an offensive counterattack. In the first stage the army placed the carts near the enemy army and by means of artillery fire provoked the enemy into battle. The artillery would usually inflict heavy casualties at close range. In order to avoid more losses, the enemy knights finally attacked. Then the infantry hidden behind the carts used firearms and crossbows to ward off the attack, weakening the enemy. The shooters aimed first at the horses, depriving the cavalry of its main advantage. Many of the knights died as their horses were shot and they fell. As soon as the enemy's morale was lowered, the second stage, an offensive counterattack, began. The infantry and the cavalry burst out from behind the carts striking violently at the enemy, mostly from the flanks. While fighting on the flanks and being shelled from the carts the enemy was not able to put up much resistance. They were forced to withdraw, leaving behind dismounted knights in heavy armor who were unable to escape the battlefield. The enemy armies suffered heavy losses and the Hussites soon had the reputation of not taking captives. Question: \`How did that crew fight? Answer:","completion":"The crew of each wagon fort, consisting of 16-22 soldiers, fought using a combination of tactics and various types of weaponry. Their tactics involved a two-stage process: defensive and offensive counterattack. 1. Defensive stage: a. Positioned the carts near the enemy army. b. Artillery fire provoked the enemy into battle, inflicting heavy casualties at close range. c. Enemy knights charged, and infantry hidden behind the carts used firearms and crossbows to ward off the attack, often targeting horses first. d. Many enemy knights died as a result of their horses being shot, causing them to fall. 2. Offensive counterattack stage: a. Once the enemy's morale was lowered, the infantry and cavalry burst out from behind the carts. b. They struck violently at the enemy, mostly from the flanks, while the enemy was simultaneously shelled from the carts. c. Faced with attacks on multiple fronts, the enemy was unable to put up much resistance and was eventually forced to withdraw. The crew fought effectively by combining the use of wagon forts as mobile fortifications with a diverse array of weapons and tactics, ultimately leading to the heavy losses of their opponents and the Hussites' reputation for not taking captives."},{"prompt":"- The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes - The snowflakes fall to the ground.

In Hamburg, Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations, but he apparently never resided with his future co-conspirators. It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence.

Given the question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: Someone probably used more than one horse to make one of these? Options: - horseradish - farmyard - western movie - canada - race track The answer is:","completion":"\\"western movie\\" First, let's break down each option: - horseradish: It's a type of root used in cooking and has nothing to do with horses in terms of its creation. - farmyard: While horses are a common animal found in a farmyard, they are not necessary or exclusively used to 'create' one. - western movie: A genre of film often featuring cowboys and historical aspects of the American Wild West, these frequently feature horses as part of their narrative and production. - canada: As a country, Canada was not made by horses. - race track: While horses are a part of the racing activities conducted on a race track, they do not physically 'make' the race track. Upon examining each choice, a 'western movie' seems to best fit the question. Western movies often feature more than one horse during the film's production, both in front of the camera (for scenes involving horse riding, carriage pulling, etc.) and possibly behind-the-scenes as well (for off-camera transportation in particularly rustic or off-road filming locations). Therefore, 'western movie' is the most sensical answer because it involves the use of multiple horses in its making."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a text passage from a trivia quiz.

Couple picked Mia because 'they both liked the name', says spokesman. Zara gave birth to Mia last week but spent just six hours in hospital. The baby is 16th in line to the throne but does not hold a royal title. Article:","completion":"Title: Rugby Icon Mike Tindall Reveals Baby's Name on Twitter: A New Royal Steps Into the Sun In a modern and candid manifestation of celebrity birth announcements, Mike Tindall, a former England rugby star, has taken to social media to share his joyous news with the world. Via Twitter, Tindall has revealed the name of his newborn daughter: Mia. On this digital platform, where fans are usually updated about the latest sports news and insightful commentaries, Mike introduced his newest family member, blending personal joys with public revelation. As representative of a younger, digitally savvy generation, Tindall's choice to release the news via Twitter excitingly diverged from traditional birth announcements associated with the British Royal family. The couple made the decision to name their newborn Mia, a joint decision driven by mutual admiration for the name, as expressed by their spokesman. Primarily Italian and Spanish in origin, 'Mia' can mean 'mine' or 'my own,' symbolizing the deep personal connection the new parents have with their baby girl. While celebrity birth announcements are nothing new in our social media era, this particular event goes beyond the usual excitement. The rugby union legend and his wife, Zara, herself an accomplished equestrian and the daughter of Princess Anne, are closely associated with the royal household. Zara, an esteemed Olympian, is the eldest granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II, making their newborn not just the child of popular athletes but the latest addition to the long line of British royals. Mia was born last week, with Zara reportedly spending only six brief hours in the hospital post-delivery. This quick return to the comfort and privacy of the home environment reflects the couple's desire for an ordinary family life despite their extraordinary public persona. The new baby further strengthens the line of the British throne as she falls 16th in direct succession. However, unlike her royal cousins, she does not don a royal title. This intentional decision not to take a royal title is in line with her mother, Zara, who was also brought up without a title. Zara's parents, Anne and Captain Mark Phillips, rejected offers of titles, ensuring their children would not be bound by the same traditional protocol that comes with such privilege. Despite the ties with royalty, the Tindall’s seem to approach life and parenthood with a view for normalcy and the everyday joys of a regular family. The disclosure of the royal baby's name through Twitter depicts the evolving landscape of royal communications, demonstrating how the couple is embracing elements of modernity while still respecting royal tradition. The name 'Mia' may well become a hot choice amongst expectant parents around the world, as is usually seen with royal names. The charm undoubtedly lies in its simplicity and the deep affection invested in it by her famous and well-liked parents. In the meantime, as the world celebrates the arrival of Mia, the newborn will remain ensconced in the love of her family and the well wishes of millions worldwide. The future holds great promise for the toddler, who, despite being born into extraordinary circumstances, begins her journey amidst the same pure joy and jubilation experienced by all newborns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What happens before the season of sacrifice?\\" Context: \\"The term Carnival is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence. However, the Philippines, a predominantly Roman Catholic country, does not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after 1939, the last carnival in the country. In historically Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday. In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Before the season of sacrifice, various pre-Lenten celebrations and traditions take place in different regions and cultures all around the world. Primarily observed in countries with strong Christian influences, these celebrations serve as an opportunity for people to engage in festivities and enjoy the pleasures of life before the rigorous fasting and penitential observances of the Lenten season. In areas with a large Roman Catholic presence, the pre-Lenten season is marked by Carnival, which involves elaborate costume parades, music, dancing, and indulgence in food and drink. The Carnival season traditionally begins on the Feast of the Epiphany (January 6), and culminates with the Mardi Gras (Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday), the day before the first day of Lent (Ash Wednesday). However, in countries such as the Philippines, which is predominantly Roman Catholic, Carnival is no longer celebrated after the dissolution of the Manila Carnival in 1939. Instead, Filipinos observe their own unique way to prepare for the Lenten season, called \\"Pabasa\\" or \\"Pasyon\\", which is a recitation of the narrative of Christ's life, passion, and death. In historically Lutheran countries like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, the pre-Lenten celebration is known as Fastelavn. Traditionally held on the Sunday or Monday seven weeks before Easter, Fastelavn typically involves children dressing up in costumes, exchanging colorful cards known as \\"fastelavnskort,\\" and participating in fun activities, such as hitting a barrel filled with sweets and goodies (similar to a piñata) until it breaks open. In areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten festivities occur on Shrove Tuesday, which involves indulging in rich, fatty foods like pancakes before the fasting of Lent begins. It is often associated with penitential observances and reflection, preparing oneself spiritually for the coming season of sacrifice. In Eastern Orthodox nations, such as Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, the pre-Lenten season is called Maslenitsa or \\"Butter Week.\\" Celebrated during the week before Great Lent, Maslenitsa involves colorful festivities, folk music, games, and the consumption of traditional pancakes called \\"blini,\\" which symbolize the sun. As a fusion of pagan and Christian traditions, this celebration serves as a precursor to the stricter fasting period and religious observances that follow during Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season typically opens on November 11 (often at 11:11 a.m.)—a date that dates back to celebrations held before the Advent season or harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day. These festivities, also known as Fasching or Fastnacht, are marked by parades, costume parties, and other merrymaking activities before the somber tone of the Lenten season sets in. In conclusion, the time before the season of sacrifice is marked by various celebrations that differ according to cultural and religious backgrounds. These festivities allow people to engage in fun, merrymaking, and often indulgence before they embark on the solemn, reflective, and penitential observances of the Lenten period."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Ben chose the Select from the following. [I] city because it was lightly populated in traffic.. [II] suburb because it was lightly populated in traffic..","completion":"II] Ben chose the suburb because it was lightly populated in traffic. Growing up in the hustle and bustle of the city, Ben had been exposed to noisy streets, polluted air, and overcrowded roads for as long as he could remember. As an introvert, he craved the serenity of a peaceful environment. This desire led him to research new towns and areas to relocate to. In his research, he discovered a charming suburb only an hour's drive from the city where he worked. With vast green spaces, an excellent school district, and considerably less traffic, it seemed like the perfect escape from the metropolitan chaos. Once he had made up his mind to relocate there, Ben began searching for a suitable house. He sought the help of a local real estate agent who provided him a list of available properties. After viewing a few moderately sized houses surrounded by beautiful gardens and friendly neighbors, he settled on one that felt like it could become a true home. A two-story, three-bedroom house with an inviting front porch and a spacious backyard, perfect for gardening and hosting family barbecues. Ben cherished his weekends spent exploring the new area: bicycling along peaceful lanes framed by towering oak trees, stopping by the local farmers' market to pick up fresh produce, and even joining an amateur gardening group to connect with like-minded individuals. Being able to inhale the fresh air and enjoy the sight of children playing safely in their front yards brought immeasurable joy to Ben's heart. The most significant positive change, however, was the noticeable decline in traffic. With fewer cars populating the streets and less air pollution clouding the skies, Ben's overall quality of life improved. The shorter commute to work meant less stress and more free time to pursue his hobbies, like jogging along the scenic suburban trails and picking up landscape photography as a creative outlet. The tranquility of the area was soul-soothing and allowed him to recharge his batteries after work, away from the constant distractions of city living. Living in the suburb also offered a great opportunity for Ben to be more involved in his community. The tight-knit neighborhoods welcomed him with open arms, inviting him to participate in local events and helping him build lasting connections. From volunteering at the community library to organizing charity bake sales, Ben found a sense of belonging in his new surroundings. As the years passed, Ben's love for his suburban oasis continued to deepen. He eventually married and had children, and the suburb proved to be an excellent place for them to grow up. Access to excellent schools, sports clubs, and various extracurricular activities allowed his children to create lasting memories and enrich their lives. Of course, Ben never entirely gave up his connection to the city. His job still required him to commute, and he visited friends and family who remained there. But the relief of returning to the serene suburb after a long workday in the city reinforced his belief that he had made the right choice. In choosing a less congested life over the crowded city, Ben discovered greater happiness and rejuvenation in the calm and friendly suburb. It offered him tranquility, improved his well-being, and allowed him to enjoy his life in a way he had never been able to before. The suburb, once a distant unknown, became the sanctuary he never knew he needed, and a place where he could truly call home."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The field dimensions are within the range found optimal by FIFA: 110--120 yards (100--110 m) long by 70--80 yards (64--73 m) wide. These soccer field dimensions are wider than the regulation American football field width of 53 ⁄ yards (48.8 m), or the 65-yard (59 m) width of a Canadian football field. The playing surface typically consists of grass as opposed to artificial turf, as the latter is generally disfavored for soccer matches since players are more susceptible to injuries. However, some soccer specific stadiums, such as Portland's Providence Park and Creighton University's Morrison Stadium, do have artificial turf. Available choices: [A]. no.

Problem:OBJECTIVES We investigated the role of cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cachexia development in newly diagnosed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. METHODS : We evaluated 44 (M/F:41/3) NSCLC patients and 12 (M/F:10/2) age matched healthy smokers. NSCLC cases with a weight loss of > or =10% consisted the cachectic group (n:23, M/F:21/2) and the ones with <10% weight loss consisted the noncachectic group (n:21, M/F:19/2). RESULTS Body mass index (BMI) of cachectics was significantly lower than that of noncachectics (21.0 +/- 2.9 versus 24.5 +/- 3.6, P = 0.02) and controls (21.0 +/- 2.9 versus 25.5 +/- 2.6, P = 0.01). Serum TNF-alpha level did not differ between cachectic and noncachectics (37.3 +/- 39.1 and 51.6 +/- 84.2 pg/mL, respectively). However, it was significantly higher in NSCLC patients compared with controls (44.1 +/- 64.3 and 15.1 +/- 14.3 pg/mL, P = 0.03). Serum IL-6 level was not different between 3 groups (6.4 +/- 4.1, 8.9 +/- 16.3, and 4.1 +/- 3.5 pg/mL, respectively) but it correlated significantly with TNF-alpha (r = 0.4, P = 0.006) and BMI (r = -0.3, P = 0.03). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) correlated significantly with TNF-alpha (r = 0.4, P = 0.003) and BMI (r = -0.3, P = 0.03). Among 44 cases, survival of 12 and 17 patients was recorded in cachectics and noncachectics, with no statistical difference (12.2 +/- 3.7 and 11.2 +/- 1.0 months, respectively). CONCLUSIONS TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels did not differ significantly between cachectics and noncachectics. However, significant correlations between IL-6, BMI, and TNF-alpha suggested that these cytokines acted as cofactors in weight loss. Survival was neither influenced by BMI, nor the cytokine levels in the present study. The significant correlation of ESR with TNF-alpha suggested that ESR could provide valuable clue for considerable weight loss in the follow-up of NSCLC patients.

Here's a step-by-step approach: 1. Identify sentiment-bearing words or phrases in the review: - \\"Einfach nur geil!!!\\": This phrase means \\"simply awesome\\" in English, which indicates strong positive sentiment. - \\"Diesen Film muss mann einfach gesehen haben!\\": This translates to \\"This movie is a must-watch!\\", another positive sentiment. - \\"Der 1. Teil war schon lustig bis zum abwinken\\": This means \\"The first part was already funny to the max\\", suggesting positive sentiment. - \\"Aber jetzt der\\": This phrase means \\"But this one (referring to the second part)\\", indicating that the speaker is about to express an opinion about the second part of the film. Since the overall sentiment in the review is positive, this likely carries a positive sentiment as well. - \\"Und da \\"Red Bull\\" (auch bekannt aus Hausmeister Krause;Axel Stein) sowieso der beste ist\\": Translated to \\"And since 'Red Bull' (also known from Hausmeister Krause;Axel Stein) is the best anyway\\", indicating strong positive sentiment. - \\"muss man diesen Film einfach gesehen haben!!!\\": This phrase means \\"one has to see this movie\\", reinforcing a positive sentiment. 2. Evaluate the overall sentiment of the review: After identifying the sentiment-bearing words or phrases in the review, it is evident that all of them express positive sentiment. There are exclamations and strong adjectives used throughout the review, which indicate enthusiasm and positivity from the reviewer. 3. Classify the review: Considering all of the sentiment-bearing words and phrases identified in the text and their overall sentiment, we classify this review as \\"POS\\" (Positive)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: This article: After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\").

Nearly a year after Sept. 11, the Legal Aid Society-the lawyers for New York's poor and homeless-remains, well, homeless. The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\"? is inside the article: Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century. As a..., can you guess it ?

Smetana is considered a vital figure in the development of Czech nationalist music and the canon of Czech opera. However, despite his professional accomplishments, his personal life was filled with hardships, including a stressful marriage to Bettina and strained relationships with his children. The passage describing the event indicates the emotional turmoil within Smetana's family and details the impact of his declining mental and physical health on his loved ones when he was transferred to the asylum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Ace of Base was a Swedish pop group, originally consisting of Ulf \\"Buddha\\" Ekberg and three siblings: Jonas \\"Joker\\" Berggren, Malin \\"Linn\\" Berggren and Jenny Berggren. The group released four studio albums between 1992 and 2002, which sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, making it the third-most successful Swedish band of all time, after ABBA and Roxette. Happy Nation (reissued as The Sign) is one of the best-selling debut albums of all time, and was certified nine times platinum in the United States. Context: Ace of Base released its fourth studio album, Da Capo, on September 30, 2002, in Europe, and in Japan through Toshiba EMI with a different cover and three bonus tracks. The album had originally been planned for release in mid-2000, but was repeatedly postponed due to record company complications. The album received only a soft release in the United Kingdom and was not released in America or Australia, though a release was planned for the United States in 2003. The album is named for the musical term da capo, which translates as \\"back to the beginning\\". It was intended to be a return to the band's earliest sound. Although the album entered the album charts in many European countries, it was not as successful as previous releases. Only Jenny and Ulf went on a promotional tour of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Germany, Poland and Austria. Jonas didn't attend promotional activities because \\"it was better to be two then\\" because it led to \\"less questions\\" about Linn's lack of participation. Linn attended only one performance in Germany, which was her last public appearance. The first single release from the Da Capo album was \\"Beautiful Morning\\", which peaked at No.14 in Sweden and No. 38 in Germany, where it was followed by \\"The Juvenile\\"; this was used for a Christmas campaign by German TV channel RTL. \\"The Juvenile\\" was previously written for the GoldenEye James Bond movie in 1995. However, Arista, the band's American record label at the time, shelved the idea. In Scandinavia, Edel-Mega released the album's opening track, \\"Unspeakable\\", as the second single, but its poor chart performance ended the promotion of the album prematurely. Question: did it have any singles? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the Ace of Base album Da Capo had singles. The first single released from the album was \\"Beautiful Morning,\\" which did well on the charts in Sweden and Germany. Another single, \\"The Juvenile,\\" was used for a Christmas campaign by a German TV channel. In Scandinavia, the song \\"Unspeakable\\" was released as a single, but it didn't perform as well on the charts."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: - caps is 1 45 16 15 59 29 61 - nationalyears is 2011 -- - ntupdate is 26 march 2011 - birth date is 28 december 1985 - clubs is sion ii yverdon-sport chiasso lausanne-sport nyon Étoile carouge - nationalcaps is 1 - currentclub is Étoile carouge - height is 1.80 - nationalgoals is 0 - nationalteam is guinea-bissau - birth place is portugal - position is midfielder - years is 2005 2011 2011 -- 2012 2012 -- -- 2007 2007 2007 -- 2008 2008 -- - clubnumber is 10 - pcupdate is 9 january 2012 - image is abdul carrupt.jpg - goals is 0 28 3 1 10 4 22 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

These settings would involve customizing aspects of the fields such as visibility, validation rules, or appearance. 3. Agricultural field: If \\"Field Settings\\" pertain to the configurations for an agricultural field, the hypothesis would also seem reasonable. These settings could include crop rotation, planting techniques, or irrigation systems which affect the agricultural field. Considering these different interpretations, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis could also be true.

Jose Mourinho spent long periods of last season bemoaning his lack of a 'real striker' - but this pre season he is putting in the hours to get exactly what he wants. At Chelsea's Waldarena training base in Austria, the Chelsea boss has been spending a lot of time with his new £32million hitman Diego Costa, working to ensure that the 25-year-old knows what his new manager expects of him. Mourinho's man-management skills have long been lauded as the best around. Back in his first spell at Stamford Bridge in 2004, he told Frank Lampard he was the best player in the world - and the prolific midfielder went on to guide the Blues to their first title in 50 years. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Diego Costa wax Xabi Alonso's leg sitting on the bench. Special ones: Jose Mourinho lets new signing Diego Costa know exactly what to do on the training field. Powerhouse: Costa will pose a handful for Premier League defences next season when on runs like this one. Rivals: Fernando Torres and new signing Costa will likely fight in out for one place up front at Stamford Bridge. This is how you do it: Mourinho put in a lot of time with his new striker to help him hit the ground running. Not-so-hot-shot: Cesar Azpilicueta aims a shot which Cech saves - the full back has just one goal for Chelsea. New boys galore: Cesc Fabregas gets away from Filipe Luis with youngster Izzy Brown approaching. First goal: Petr Cech, back in training with the first team, tries to get to a Luis shot across the goal. Now, Mourinho looks to be giving Costa the same treatment in the hope the addition of a proven goalscorer can help Chelsea go two marks better in the Premier League and the Champions League. In the second session of their Austrian training camp, Mourinho was often spotted having a word in Costa's ear, pointing out where he wanted to be and explaining his tactics. He wants the former Atletico forward to hit the ground running - and not to become the latest of Chelsea's scrapheap of failed big money striker purchases. And Costa, who had a difficult World Cup as Spain were knocked out in the group stage, looked to be pleased with how things are going since joining up with Chelsea's squad - smiling and posing for selfies with fans. Elsewhere, Petr Cech was back with the first team, fielding shots from new boy Filipe Luis among others as Chelsea prepare for their third pre season game on Wednesday against RZ Pellets. Let me take a selfie: Costa and Fabregas both pose for photos with Chelsea's fans at their Austria base. Back in town: Gary Cahill escapes the attentions of Lewis Baker and Nemanja Matic to play a pass. Relief: Mo Salah, fresh from the news he is not required for military service, takes possession of the ball. Not-so-hot-shot: Cesar Azpilicueta aims a shot which Cech saves - the full back has just one goal for Chelsea. Doing well: Mourinho's gesture appears to show his appreciation for the players' work in Austria. Taking it seriously: Skipper John Terry calls for the ball during a game organised by Mourinho. Utility man: Branislav Ivanovic, who played up front against Wimbledon at the weekend, tackles Dominic Solanke. Familiar territory: Ivanovic tries to get a diving header past Cech at the Waldarena. Mr Nice Guy: Costa signs autographs at the Waldarena in Austria and is joined by former Atletico team mate Filipe Luis. Get into the groove: Cech will have been relieved to make his return with Thibaut Courtois threatening his place. Youth vs new: Nathaniel Chalobah comes up against Fabregas in a midfield duel. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article discuss how Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been working closely with new signing Diego Costa during the team's pre-season training camp in Austria.

Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub.

Plato (; Greek: Platon Platon, pronounced [pla.to:n] in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 - 348/347 BC) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. Others believe that the oldest extant manuscript dates to around AD 895, 1100 years after Plato's death. Although Socrates influenced Plato directly as related in the dialogues, the influence of Pythagoras upon Plato also appears to have significant discussion in the philosophical literature. Pythagoras, or in a broader sense, the Pythagoreans, allegedly exercised an important influence on the work of Plato. According to R. M. Hare, this influence consists of three points: (1) The platonic Republic might be related to the idea of \\"a tightly organized community of like-minded thinkers\\", like the one established by Pythagoras in Croton. (2) There is evidence that Plato possibly took from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and, generally speaking, abstract thinking is a secure basis for philosophical thinking as well as \\"for substantial theses in science and morals\\". (3) Plato and Pythagoras shared a \\"mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world\\". It is probable that both were influenced by Orphism. Pythagoras held that all things are number, and the cosmos comes from numerical principles. The physical world of becoming is an imitation of the mathematical world of being. This ideas were very influential in Heraclitus, Parmenides and Plato. Aristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans, and Cicero repeats this claim: \\"They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean\\" (Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia). George Karamanolis notes that Numenius accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the two authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded Plato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he considered to be the source of all true philosophy--including Plato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many philosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed on only orally. The precise relationship between Plato and Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars. Plato makes it clear in his Apology of Socrates that he was a devoted young follower of Socrates. In that dialogue, Socrates is presented as mentioning Plato by name as one of those youths close enough to him to have been corrupted, if he were in fact guilty of corrupting the youth, and questioning why their fathers and brothers did not step forward to testify against him if he was indeed guilty of such a crime (33d-34a). Later, Plato is mentioned along with Crito, Critobolus, and Apollodorus as offering to pay a fine of 30 minas on Socrates' behalf, in lieu of the death penalty proposed by Meletus (38b). In the Phaedo, the title character lists those who were in attendance at the prison on Socrates' last day, explaining Plato's absence by saying, \\"Plato was ill\\". (Phaedo 59b) Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues. In the Second Letter, it says, \\"no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new\\" (341c); if the Letter is Plato's, the final qualification seems to call into question the dialogues' historical fidelity. In any case, Xenophon and Aristophanes seem to present a somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints. Some have called attention to the problem of taking Plato's Socrates to be his mouthpiece, given Socrates' reputation for irony and the dramatic nature of the dialogue form. Aristotle attributes a different doctrine with respect to Forms to Plato and Socrates (Metaphysics 987b1-11). Aristotle suggests that Socrates' idea of forms can be discovered through investigation of the natural world, unlike Plato's Forms that exist beyond and outside the ordinary range of human understanding. Mythos and logos are terms that evolved along classical Greece history. In the times of Homer and Hesiod (8th century BC) they were quite synonyms, and contained the meaning of tale or history. Later came historians like Herodotus and Thucydides, as well as philosophers as Parmenides and other Presocratics that introduced a distinction between both terms, and mythos became more a nonverifiable account, and logos a rational account. Plato, being a disciple of Socrates, and a strong partisan of philosophy based on logos, it seems that should have avoided the use of myth-telling. Instead he made an abundant use of it. This fact has produced analytical and interpretative work, in order to clarify the reasons and purposes for that use. Plato, in general, distinguished between three types of myth. First there were the false myths, like those based on stories of gods subject to passions and sufferings, because reason teaches that God is perfect. Then came the myths based on true reasoning, and therefore also true. Finally there were those non verifiable because beyond of human reason, but containing some truth in them. Regarding the subjects of Plato's myths they are of two types, those dealing with the origin of the universe, and those about morals and the origin and fate of the soul. It is generally agreed that the main purpose for Plato in using myths was didactic. He considered that only a few people were capable or interested in following a reasoned philosophical discourse, but men in general are attracted by stories and tales. Consequently then, he used the myth to convey the conclusions of the philosophical reasoning. Some of Plato's myths were based in traditional ones, others were modifications of them, and finally he also invented altogether new myths.","completion":"This text is about Plato, a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens. Born around 428/427 or 424/423 BC, he is considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, particularly in the Western tradition. Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years, making his philosophies one of the most enduring in human history. In the text, the influence of Socrates and Pythagoras on Plato's work is addressed. Despite the complexity of their relationships, both thinkers had significant impacts on Plato's ideas, shaping his approach to philosophy, mathematics, and the concept of the soul. The text also discusses how Plato's relationship with Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars, as Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues, and Socrates' reputation for irony complicates the process of determining which ideas can be attributed to him. Furthermore, the text mentions how the concepts of mythos (myth) and logos (reason) evolved in ancient Greece and how Plato incorporated myths in his work. He distinguished between three types of myths - false myths, myths based on true reasoning, and non-verifiable myths containing some truth. Plato's usage of myth was primarily didactic, as he believed that most people were more drawn to stories and tales rather than philosophical discourse. Thus, he employed myths to convey the conclusions resulting from his philosophical reasoning. Some of the myths he used were based on traditional ones, others were modifications of pre-existing myths, and some were entirely new creations. In summary, this text discusses the life and work of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, emphasizing his contributions to the development of Western philosophy, his relationships with other philosophical figures like Socrates and Pythagoras, and his unique approach to incorporating myths in his work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the following context: In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine.

He emerged as the paramount leader of the Indian independence movement under the tutelage of Mahatma Gandhi and ruled India from its establishment as an independent nation in 1947 until his death in 1964. He is considered to be the architect of the modern Indian nation-state: a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. He was also known as Pandit Nehru due to his roots with the Kashmiri Pandit community while many Indian children knew him as \\"Uncle Nehru\\" (\\"Chacha\\" Nehru). - India held general elections to the 5th Lok Sabha in March 1971 . This was the fifth election since independence in 1947 . The 27 Indian states and union territories were represented by 518 constituencies , each with a single seat . Under the leadership of Indira Gandhi , the Indian National Congress ( R ) led a campaign which focussed on reducing poverty and won a landslide victory , overcoming a split in the party and regaining many of the seats lost in the previous election . During her previous term , there had been internal divisions in the Indian National Congress between Indira Gandhi and the party establishment , especially Morarji Desai . In 1969 , she was expelled from the party , causing a split . Most of the Congress MPs and grassroots support joined Gandhi 's Indian National Congress ( R ) faction , which was recognized by the Election Commission as being the successor to the previous party . 31 MPs who opposed Gandhi became the Indian National Congress ( Organization ) party . Despite the split , the Ruling faction gained votes and seats to win a strong majority , whereas the Organization faction lost half of their seats . On 12 June 1975 , the Allahabad High Court invalidated the result in Gandhi 's constituency on the grounds of electoral malpractices . Instead of resigning , Indira Gandhi called a state of emergency , suspending democracy and outlawed political opposition . After democracy was restored in 1977 , the opposition Congress faction formed a coalition of parties called the Janata Party , which inflicted the Congress ' first electoral defeat . - Indian National Congress (R) was a split in Indian National Congress, created by Indira Gandhi in 1967 when a united opposition, under the banner of Samyukt Vidhayak Dal, won control over several states in the Hindi belt. Indira Gandhi, the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, and Congress president, was then challenged by the majority of the party leadership. Initially this party was known as Congress (R), but it soon came to be generally known as the \\"New Congress\\". The letter 'R' stands for 'Requisition'. The official party became the Indian National Congress (Organisation) (INC(O)) led by Kamaraj. It was informally called the \\"Old Congress\\" and retained the party symbol of a pair of bullocks carrying a yoke. Mrs. Gandhi's breakaway faction were given a new symbol of a cow with suckling calf by the Election Commission as the party election symbol. - The Lok Sabha (House of the People) is the Lower house of India's bicameral Parliament, with the Upper house being the Rajya Sabha. Members of the Lok Sabha are elected by adult universal suffrage and a first-past-the-post system to represent their respective constituencies, and they hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved by the President on the advice of the council of ministers. The house meets in the Lok Sabha Chambers of the Sansad Bhavan in New Delhi. - Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi (Nehru; 19 November 1917 31 October 1984) was an Indian politician and central figure of the Indian National Congress party, and to date the only female Prime Minister of India. Indira Gandhi was the daughter of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. She served as Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977 and then again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984, making her the second-longest-serving Prime Minister of India after her father. Gandhi served as her father's personal assistant and hostess during his tenure as prime minister between 1947 and 1964. She was elected Congress President in 1959. Upon her father's death in 1964, Gandhi refused to enter the Congress party leadership contest and instead chose to become a cabinet minister in the government led by Lal Bahadur Shastri. In the Congress Party's parliamentary leadership election held in early 1966, upon the death of Shastri, she defeated her rival, Morarji Desai, to become leader, and thus succeeded Shastri as Prime Minister of India. - Morarji Desai Nishan-e-Pakistan (29 February 1896 10 April 1995) was an Indian independence activist and the Prime Minister of India from 1977 to 1979. He was also the first Prime Minister to head India's first non-Congress Government. He held many important posts in the Government of India such as: Chief Minister of Bombay State, Home Minister, Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India. On the international scene, Desai holds international fame for his peace activism and made efforts to initiate peace between two rival South Asian states, Pakistan and India. After India's first nuclear explosion in 1974, Desai helped restore friendly relations with China and Pakistan, and vowed to avoid armed conflict such as Indo-Pakistani war of 1971. Domestically, he played a crucial role in the Indian nuclear program after it was targeted by major nuclear powers after conducting a surprise test in 1974. Morarji Desai closed down much of India's premier intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), and reduced its budget and operations. Desai remains the only Indian national to be conferred with Pakistan's highest civilian award, \\"Nishan-e-Pakistan\\", which was conferred on him by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1990 in a colorful ceremony. Later, his policies promoted social, health and administrative reforms in the country. It is rumored that he was a mole of CIA in Indira Gandhi led cabinet. He also revealed the R&AW is well aware of Pakistan's Nuclear activity in Kahuta to the Pakistani general Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in a telephonic conversation. - The Prime Minister of India (Hindi: , \\"Bhrat k Pradhnamantr\\") is the Head of Government and leader of the executive branch of the Government of India. The Prime Minister is also the chief adviser to the President of India and head of the Council of Ministers. He or she can be a member of any of the two houses of Parliament (the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha), but has to be the leader of the political party, having a majority in the Lok Sabha. - The Rajya Sabha or \\"Council of States\\" is the upper house of the Parliament of India. Membership of Rajya Sabha is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of 250 members, and current laws have provision for 245 members.

She stays in a budget hotel and spends time in a bar during her time off. The murder in Texas took place before Ramirez's first known killing. Kit initially speaks with Ramirez by phone through glass; he refuses to reveal anything until they meet in a visitation room.

He remains uncooperative because guards are in the room, but suggests that they can have privacy if she says she's his lawyer. Even then he remains uncooperative and insulting, demanding that she reveal personal details about herself to make herself interesting enough that she deserves to know more about him.

ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. What did the friars record on their parchment scrolls? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. terms of surrender B. names of prizoners to die C. not enough information D. something religious. Answer:","completion":"B. names of prisoners to die The friars were recording the names of each person about to die on their parchment scrolls according to the narrative provided. This meticulous documentation forms a significant part of the Inquisition's power. These records take note of those who held on to their Cathar faith despite the ultimatum of converting to the Catholic religion or facing death. Far from a simple list, these documents were grim symbols of the Church's power to determine life and death based on religious belief. The texts would forever bear the names of the brave, the faithful, and the stubborn, who chose to adhere to their faith rather than avoid death. They embody the horrifyingly organized, cold, bureaucratic side of religious persecution, where every doomed soul is accounted for and their names minutely recorded. The narrative portrays a chilling scenario of faith, sacrifice, and the ruthless might of the Inquisition. These scrolls of death, these lists of the condemned, were the stark reminders of the price the Cathars paid for holding their ground against the Catholic Church. Thus, these parchments were far more than sheets of dead animal skin with ink markings; they were narratives of steadfast faith and brutal persecution, indelible testaments to a dark chapter in religious history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What tune is the caretaker whistling ? Movie title: The Ruins Movie plot: Two young American couples â Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) and Amy (Jena Malone), and Eric (Shawn Ashmore) and Stacy (Laura Ramsey) â enjoy their vacation in Mexico. They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias. The cell phone is heard again from deep in the shaft so Stacy and Amy descend again. In a small, vine-covered room, the...

That has halted all but the most essential operations and marred the one-year anniversary of President Trump's inauguration in a striking display of Washington dysfunction. Last-minute negotiations crumbled as Senate Democrats blocked a four-week stopgap extension in a late-night vote, causing the fourth government shutdown in a quarter century. Behind the scenes, however, leading Republicans and Democrats were trying to work out a compromise to avert a lengthy shutdown. Congress scheduled an unusual Saturday session to begin considering a three-week version of the short-term spending measure, reports the AP. The AP separately tracks the path to the shutdown: It was shortly after 7:30pm Thursday when the Republican-led House passed a 30-day spending plan. With less than 29 hours until the shutdown deadline, attention quickly shifted to the Senate, where 60 votes were needed. In a sign of the trouble to come, the Senate couldn't even agree on when to adjourn for the night. When lawmakers did return Friday morning, a shutdown suddenly seemed more likely than ever. Expand this summary.","completion":"At midnight on Friday, the federal government shut down as Senate Democrats blocked a four-week stopgap extension in a late-night vote, thus halting all but the most essential operations and marking the one-year anniversary of President Trump's inauguration with significant political discord in Washington. This latest shutdown marks the fourth government shutdown in the last 25 years, and it puts a spotlight on the dysfunction within the current political landscape. In the lead-up to the shutdown, the Republican-led House managed to pass a 30-day spending plan at around 7:30pm on Thursday, leaving just under 29 hours until the shutdown deadline. The focus then shifted to the Senate, where a total of 60 votes were required to pass the plan. A sign of the impending trouble, the Senate was unable to agree on when to adjourn for the night. When lawmakers returned on Friday morning, the likelihood of a shutdown had become even more apparent. One of the significant factors behind this political impasse is the inability of Democrats and Republicans to agree on key issues such as immigration, military and nondefense spending levels, and border security. The discord is exacerbated by the fact that both parties need each other's support to pass any legislation in the Senate, with Republicans holding only 51 out of 100 seats. Despite the shutdown, important services such as Social Security, Medicare, and mail deliveries will continue uninterrupted. However, federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, National Parks, and NASA will be significantly affected. Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of federal workers will be on furlough without pay until the government reopens. Behind the scenes, key Republicans and Democrats have been working to find a compromise to avert a lengthy shutdown. Congress scheduled an unusual Saturday session to begin considering a three-week version of the short-term spending measure, as reported by the Associated Press (AP). However, even if a short-term resolution is reached, the longer-term challenges and disagreements between the parties will remain, raising concerns for future government funding debates and discussions. In conclusion, the federal government shutdown at midnight on Friday demonstrates the ongoing dysfunction in Washington. The discord between Democrats and Republicans, largely due to differing opinions on key issues, led to the failure to pass a stopgap extension that would have kept the government open. Although crucial services such as Social Security and Medicare will continue, many federal agencies and workers are adversely affected by the shutdown. While leading Republicans and Democrats are attempting to find a compromise to resolve the situation in the short-term, the underlying divisions on key issues remain and are expected to persist in future government funding deliberations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro \\"Matz\\" Matsumoto in Japan. According to its creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. Ruby was conceived on February 24, 1993. In a 1999 post to the \\"ruby-talk\\" mailing list, Ruby author Yukihiro Matsumoto describes some of his early ideas about the language: Matsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simple Lisp language at its core, with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl. The name \\"Ruby\\" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language. Initially two names were proposed: \\"Coral\\" and \\"Ruby\\". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka. Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name \\"Ruby\\" – it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues. The first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domestic newsgroups on December 21, 1995. Subsequently, three more versions of Ruby were released in two days. The release coincided with the launch of the Japanese-language \\"ruby-list\\" mailing list, which was the first mailing list for the new language. 1.

While it is true that Jay Kahn is a Democratic member of the New Hampshire Senate representing the 10th district, one cannot definitively ascertain whether or not he will choose to live in the 10th district after retirement. It is important to consider that personal choices and circumstances may change significantly over time, especially as individuals transition from a professional to a retired lifestyle. There is always the possibility that Jay Kahn would decide to stay in the 10th district after retirement, as he may have grown attached to the region he represents and formed strong connections with its residents. Additionally, he may be proud of the work he accomplished while in office and feel a sense of responsibility towards the area. In this situation, if he chooses to stay, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that he may continue to contribute to the community in a more informal capacity, given his knowledge of local issues and relationships with community members. On the other hand, it is equally plausible that Jay Kahn will choose to move elsewhere after retiring from the New Hampshire Senate. His retirement plans might include relocating to a different region or state altogether for various reasons. For example, he might choose to live closer to family members or friends, move to a location with a more desirable climate, or pursue various personal hobbies or interests that could be better accommodated in a different area. Moreover, it is worth noting that people may prioritize different factors in their retirement decisions, including factors unrelated to their previous work or affiliations. In conclusion, while Jay Kahn's career as a Democratic member of the New Hampshire Senate for the 10th district could potentially be an influential factor in his retirement plans, it is ultimately impossible to definitively predict his choice based on the context provided. Therefore, the hypothesis that Jay Kahn will live in the 10th district after retirement cannot be confirmed nor denied with certainty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

His work displays a nostalgia for American folk culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and satire of contemporary American culture. Crumb is a prolific artist and contributed to many of the seminal works of the underground comix movement in the 1960s, including being a founder of the first successful underground comix publication, Zap Comix, contributing to all 16 issues. He was additionally contributing to the East Village Other and many other publications, including a variety of one-off and anthology comics. Crumb's father gave him 40 when he left home after high school. His first job, in 1962, was drawing novelty greeting cards for American Greetings in Cleveland, Ohio. He stayed with the company for four years, producing hundreds of cards for the company's Hi-Brow line; his superiors had him draw in a cuter style that was to leave a footprint on his work throughout his career. In Cleveland he met a group of young bohemians such as Buzzy Linhart, Liz Johnston, and Harvey Pekar. Dissatisfied with greeting card work, he tried to sell cartoons to comic book companies, who showed little interest in his work. In 1965, cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman printed some of Crumb's work in the humor magazine he edited, Help!. Crumb moved to New York, intending to work with Kurtzman, but Help! ceased publication shortly after. Crumb briefly illustrated bubblegum cards for Topps before returning to Cleveland and American Greetings. Crumb married Dana Morgan in 1964. Nearly destitute, the couple traveled in Europe, during which Crumb continued to produce work for Kurtzman and American Greetings, and Dana stole food. The relationship was unstable as Crumb frequently went his own way, and he was not close to his son Jesse (b. 1965). In 1965 and 1966 Crumb had a number of Fritz the Cat strips published in the men's magazine Cavalier. Fritz had appeared in Crumb's work as early as the late 1950s; he was to become a hipster, scam artist, and bohemian until Crumb abandoned the character in 1969. Crumb was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with his job and marriage when in June 1965 he began taking LSD, a psychedelic drug that was then still legal. He had both good and bad trips. One bad trip left him in a muddled state for half a year, during which for a time he left Dana; the state ended when the two took a strong dose of the drug together in April 1966. Crumb created a number of his best-known characters during his years of LSD use, including Mr. Natural, Angelfood McSpade, and the Snoid. Was Fritz a character he developed?","completion":"Yes, Fritz the Cat was a character developed by Robert Crumb. Fritz first appeared in Crumb's work as early as the late 1950s. The character later evolved into a hipster, scam artist, and bohemian figure featured in a series of comic strips. Between 1965 and 1966, a number of Fritz the Cat comic strips were published in the men's magazine Cavalier. Fritz the Cat gained significant popularity and was an important part of Crumb's body of work until he decided to abandon the character in 1969. Fritz the Cat is known for its satirical and provocative content, often reflecting the social and cultural issues of the time. The character played a crucial role in establishing Crumb's reputation as a groundbreaking and influential artist in the underground comix movement. In addition to Fritz the Cat, Crumb is also known for creating other memorable characters like Mr. Natural, Angelfood McSpade, and the Snoid, many of which were developed during his years of LSD use. Despite the controversies surrounding his work, Crumb's distinct drawing style and unique storytelling have left a lasting impact on both the comic and counterculture scenes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Peter Baynes, Chan's architect ,has achieved a clever piece of design, according to architectural experts. The Chan mini-house was built on what was once a path down the side of a big Victarian house. Not an inch of space is wasted. When you step in through the front door, you're standing in the shower, on Britain' s only self-cleansing doormat . A door opens on to an equally tiny toilet with washbasin. Two steps further in comes the kitchen, complete with full-sized cooker and fridge, and washer/ drier. A worktop folds down from the wall. Another step and you're into the dining/ office area. Four people can sit here for dinner, says Chan as he sets the table-top into place. He even has a fold-down drawing-board for when he's working at home. The bed is hidden under a cover board right at the back. \\"I don't even have to make the bed,\\" Chan says.\\" I just put the cover down. \\" Chan's business suits hang neatly on the wall over the bed. Daylight comes in through the skylight. The house feels like a very small boat and Chan admits he toyed with the idea of naming it the \\"boat-house\\". \\"It cost around PS4,700 to build last year. Now it's been valued at PS30,000. It proves that good design doesn't need to cost more. It just needs a lot of care.\\" says Chan. Question: What is the purpose of this writing? Yes or no, is the answer \\"To introduce to readers a cleverly-designed flat\\"?

Build a movie plot around this: Who does Duane quarrel with Sonny over? Jacy","completion":"Title: Unraveling Hearts Genre: Coming-of-Age Romantic-Drama Setting: The small, tight-knit coastal town of Havenport during the late 1970s. Plot: Act 1: Sonny Morris (22 years old) and Duane Sullivan (23 years old) have been best friends since childhood, growing up together in the picturesque coastal town of Havenport. They spent their days surfing, fishing, and playing beach volleyball, a pair of inseparable friends who faced the common trials of life. Enters Jacy Parker (21 years old), a beautiful and free-spirited young woman who has returned to her hometown, Havenport, after two years spent traveling and volunteering abroad. Upon her return, Jacy reconnects with her childhood friends, Sonny and Duane, and starts working at her parents' beachside café. Not only does Jacy captivate the town, but she also captures the hearts of both Sonny and Duane. Little do they know, Jacy is yet to face her entire journey of self-discovery and coming to terms with her past, an unresolved family tragedy. Act 2: Tension builds as Sonny and Duane, once best friends, find themselves quarreling over Jacy. Jacy, who appreciates both of them for unique reasons, appears to be torn between them, causing her to confront her own emotional challenges. This love triangle creates a rift throughout the tight-knit town, forcing friends and family to take sides. One night, when Havenport hosts its annual beach bonfire party, the battle for Jacy's affections reaches its boiling point. Unbeknownst to Duane and Sonny, Jacy overhears their heated argument about her, taking things out of context. Upset and confused, Jacy flees from the party and wanders along the beach. Duane and Sonny then set aside their differences, putting Jacy's well-being first. Act 3: Sonny and Duane find Jacy on a secluded stretch of sand in the moonlight, the night sea mirroring her turbulent emotions. As they approach her, Jacy's complex feelings towards her past, her family, and her feelings for Sonny and Duane come pouring out in an emotional confession. This cathartic moment pushes all three to confront their emotions and communicate honestly with each other. As dawn approaches, the trio comes to terms with the fact that friendship should come before romantic relationships. They realize that their bond goes beyond fleeting attractions, promising each other that their friendship will prevail over any emotional turbulence or setbacks. In the end, Jacy makes her own decision to focus on her personal growth and heal from her family tragedy before embarking on any romantic pursuits. Epilogue: A few years down the line, the love triangle may have faded away, but the friendship between Sonny, Duane, and Jacy remains strong. They each partake in their own personal journeys, staying in touch and providing unwavering support regardless of the choices they make. Sonny eventually pursues his dream of becoming a marine biologist and lands a job at a notable coastal research facility. Duane starts his own surfing school in Havenport, which not only becomes a thriving business but also a central hub for the town's youth, giving them direction and purpose. Jacy follows her family's footsteps, taking over her parents' café, turning it into a renowned breakfast and lunch destination that showcases locally sourced and sustainable ingredients. As the town of Havenport continues to flourish, so does the friendship between Sonny, Duane, and Jacy, proving that sometimes, love takes forms other than romance and lasts a lifetime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the keywords in the sentence: To understand the sentiment of the sentence, I will first identify the keywords that may indicate its overall sentiment. In this case, the keywords are \\"inspiring,\\" \\"Hallmark card,\\" and \\"ultimately.\\" 2. Analyze the keywords: Next, I will analyze the meaning of these keywords in the context of the sentence: a. \\"inspiring\\" - This word generally has a positive connotation, as it suggests that something is motivating or uplifting. b. \\"Hallmark card\\" - Hallmark cards are generally intended to convey positive emotions like love, appreciation, or congratulations. They are often associated with sentimental vibes, but can sometimes be seen as generic or predictable in nature. c. \\"ultimately\\" - This word implies that the sentence is making a conclusive statement about the film's overall impact or message. 3. Evaluate the sentiment: Based on the combination of these keywords within the sentence, I will evaluate the sentiment: a. The sentence states that the film is as inspiring as a Hallmark card, which suggests that the film does possess some level of emotional or motivational impact. This can be perceived as somewhat positive. b. However, it is important to note that the comparison with a Hallmark card may also imply that the inspiring aspect of the film is somewhat predictable or lacks depth. This may or may not carry a mild negative connotation, depending on how the reader interprets the comparison. 4.

The most reasonable action for Jordan to perform subsequent to obtaining and winding the hose around Jesse's way would be to water the garden. To elaborate further, the interaction between Jordan and Jesse may involve a sequence of tasks that need to be completed in the garden. They may be working together to provide optimal results in their gardening pursuits. These tasks might include fertilizing, pruning, planting, and finally, watering. Jordan may have completed the other tasks and the next step would be to ensure that the plants receive adequate water. Watering the garden is a crucial portion of any gardening routine. It provides plants with hydration, enabling them to thrive and experience healthy growth. Proper watering techniques also contribute to the successful outcome of the plants in the garden. Jordan, being knowledgeable about the importance of hydration for plants, would prioritize this task and aim to water the garden effectively. The other possible answers mentioned - \\"was usually in the way\\" and \\"liked winding\\" - do not seem to be relevant in this situation.

Snooping refers to the act of secretly observing or investigating someone or gathering information about them without their knowledge or consent. This act may involve going through someone's belongings, listening in on conversations, or monitoring their digital communications. The first question, \\"What is snooping?\\", aims to define and clarify the concept of snooping. It is an inquiry about the meaning and characteristics of snooping as an action or behavior. In this question, the focus is on understanding the term and the nature of the act. On the other hand, the second question, \\"Do you snoop, or have you snooped on your child?\\", is more of a personal inquiry directed at the person being asked the question. This question seeks to find out if the person has ever engaged in snooping, specifically with regard to their child. Here, the focus is on the respondent's past actions and experiences in the context of snooping. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Eventually , Pedro ended with many other children in the care of a man called Sebastian . Pedro eventually ended up in the care of a man named Sebastian with many other children . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Both sentences convey the same core meaning, describing that Pedro, along with many other children, ended up being cared for by a man named Sebastian. The sentences have employed different sentence structures and word arrangements to achieve the same overarching message, but their core meaning remains the same. In the first sentence, 'Eventually, Pedro ended with many other children in the care of a man called Sebastian,' the key information is presented more linearly. The sentence starts with \\"eventually,\\" denoting that the event took place over time. It then describes Pedro's situation as \\"ended with many other children in the care,\\" emphasizing that Pedro was with a group of children looked after by Sebastian. In the second sentence, 'Pedro eventually ended up in the care of a man named Sebastian with many other children,' the adverb \\"eventually\\" is placed after Pedro, creating a sense of finality as to where Pedro ended up. In this sentence structure, the focus is shifted more towards Pedro's destination, followed by Sebastian's name as the caretaker. The fact that Pedro was accompanied by other children is mentioned at the end, but it still retains the same overall meaning that Pedro was not alone in Sebastian's care. In both sentences, the idea of Pedro being a part of a group of children under Sebastian's care is present, and the use of different words to describe Sebastian (\\"called\\" in the first sentence and \\"named\\" in the second) also adds a sense of variation. Despite the slight differences in structure, both sentences ultimately convey the same essential idea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Information: - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States.

Gather necessary materials: To begin, gather the required tools and materials, including the wood piece, hand saw, measuring tape, pencil, and a workbench or stable surface to hold the wood in place. 2. Mark the wood: With the measuring tape and pencil, measure and mark the desired length on the wood where you plan to make the cut. 3. Secure the wood: Place the wood on a workbench or other stable surface to prevent it from moving while cutting. If available, use clamps to further secure the wood in place. 4. Choose the correct saw: Choose a hand saw suitable for the type of wood and project. For example, use a fine-toothed saw for cutting plywood and a coarse-toothed saw for cutting thicker lumber. 5. Position the saw: Hold the hand saw with a firm grip and position its blade on the marked line, aligning it with the intended cutting path. 6. Start cutting: Begin to cut the wood by making a few slow and controlled back and forth strokes, using the thumb of your non-dominant hand to guide the saw blade, maintaining a steady pressure. 7. Continue cutting: As the initial groove forms, increase the speed of your strokes, making sure to keep the saw blade aligned with the marked line. Maintain an even and consistent sawing motion. 8. Complete the cut: Continue sawing until the piece of wood is completely cut. Be careful not to allow the wood to bind on the saw blade, as this may cause it to get stuck or produce an irregular cut. 9. Inspect the cut: Check the cut edge for smoothness and accuracy. If necessary, you can smooth the edge with sandpaper or a wood file.

Divide by the coefficient of x on both sides of the equation. 3. Simplify the expression to determine the value of x. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution: Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. Add the two numbers on the right side of the equation: 27678 + 28909 = 56587. The equation now becomes: 797*x = 56587. Step 2: Divide by the coefficient of x on both sides of the equation. To isolate x, you need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is 797. x = (56587) / (797) Step 3: Simplify the expression to determine the value of x. Now, divide 56587 by 797 to get the value of x. x ≈ 70.998, which can be rounded to 71 (if you need an integer solution).

Available options: (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"Yes, these questions are essentially asking the same thing. They both revolve around the concept of trends coming and going. While the first question focuses on how trends come and go, the second is primarily asking for confirmation about the cyclical nature of trends. Therefore, the answer is (2). yes. Now, let us delve into the topic of trends, specifically how they come and go. A trend refers to a pattern of change or development which gains popularity or becomes a cultural phenomenon within a particular time frame. Trends affect various aspects of our lives, including fashion, technology, arts, entertainment, and even linguistics. The life cycle of a trend comprises several stages, including emergence, growth, maturity, and decline. It is essential to understand that the cycle of trends is inevitable, and this process affects all aspects of our society. 1. Emergence: This stage marks the birth of a trend. It begins with the adoption of a particular style, behavior, or idea by a group or segment of society. In many instances, trends emerge from innovative ideas or inspiration from existing cultural elements. Early adopters and influencers, including celebrities and social media personalities, often play a significant role in promoting new trends. 2. Growth: Following the emergence stage, the trend gradually gains traction and becomes more widespread. During the growth phase, the public becomes more aware of the trend, leading to increased adoption by a broader audience. Media outlets, advertisements, and word of mouth play a significant role in driving the growth of a trend. 3. Maturity: At this stage, the trend reaches its peak in popularity. A significant percentage of the target population has embraced the trend, and it becomes a significant part of mainstream culture. The maturity stage often coincides with mass production and accessibility of products or services associated with the trend. 4. Decline: As the novelty of the trend starts to wane, public interest begins to decline. The oversaturation of the market, the emergence of new or competing trends, or a shift in societal norms may contribute to the decreasing popularity of the trend. This phase signifies the beginning of the end for the trend, with fewer people identifying with or participating in it. 5. Rebirth: In some cases, trends experience a resurgence after a period of decline. This rebirth may occur due to nostalgia, reinterpretation, or adaptation for a new audience. Resurgence can happen in cyclical patterns, such as fashion trends or the revival of classic films and television shows. The life cycle of trends demonstrates how trends come and go, consistently shaping societal norms and preferences. The influence of various factors, including technological advancements, economic factors, cultural shifts, and personal tastes, contributes to the complexity and unpredictability of trends. An understanding of the nature of trends can help businesses, organizations, and individuals adapt to changing environments and stay ahead of the curve."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice. A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of Jaws). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Navy diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter. Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could \\"pass the ketchup.\\" Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason.

In \\"Risky Business,\\" we witness Joel's transformation from a naive and conscientious high school student, worried about his future and college applications, into a young entrepreneur who finds himself in the midst of a wild and scandalous adventure. Upon meeting a young sex worker named Lana, played by Rebecca De Mornay, they devise a plan to turn Joel's luxurious suburban home into a temporary brothel, all in the name of financial profit and indulgence in adult pleasures. The film is often remembered for its iconic scenes and memorable moments, such as the one in which Tom Cruise performs an exuberant dance routine in his underwear to the song \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" by Bob Seger. However, beneath its comedic surface, \\"Risky Business\\" also explores themes of existential freedom and the consequences of our choices, as well as the growing pains associated with adolescence and the transition into adulthood. Upon its release, the movie received critical acclaim, especially for Cruise's engaging performance, and has gone on to become a cult classic.

Just six after Japan celebrated the birth of its first panda bear in 24 years the newborn cub has died. The young bear is thought to have developed pneumonia and was discovered on its back lying on its mother's chest at Ueno Zoo in Tokyo. It was the first time the zoo's natural breeding programme had led to a birth, and heartwarming photos of proud mother Shin Shin cuddling her new baby had been shown around the world. Scroll down for video. Tragic: Just six after Japan celebrated the birth of its first panda bear in 24 years the newborn cub has been found dead. Heartbroken: It was the first time the zoo's natural breeding programme had been successful, and heartwarming photos of proud mother Shin Shin cuddling her new baby had been shown around the world. The baby had been kept in an incubator earlier this week, but had been returned to its mother on Tuesday. Keepers tried to massaged the panda's heart after it was found at the zoo, but the cub was declared dead an hour later. Experts say pandas often struggle to conceive naturally, particularly when they are on public display. The birth was captured on night. vision webcam and a video showing Shin Shin giving birth and holding the. tiny baby to her chest was released by the zoo. The cub was the first panda to be born after being conceived naturally in Japanese history. The task is extremely difficult task as female pandas are only in heat for 72 hours over the entire year and can only become pregnant during a 24 hour slot. In the wild female pandas normally have a cub every two or three years. Love and care: Shin Shin cuddles her newly born baby holding the cub close to her chest. The unnamed cub was too young to have gained the characteristic black. marks and its size is not living up to the name of Giant Panda. The baby panda was still unnamed when it died, but suggestions for names had caused a stir even before it was born. Shin Shin's pregnancy was only announced by Japanese governor Shintaro Ishihara last month. He said the bear would be called Sen Sen or Kaku Kaku – a wordplay on the disputed Senkaku Islands which are part of Japan but are claimed by both Taiwan and China. The giant panda is threatened by loss of habitat, poaching and a low reproduction rate. Females in the wild normally have a cub once every two to three years. Only about 1,600 pandas live in the wild, mostly in China's southwestern Sichuan province. Around 300 live in captivity mostly in Chinese breeding centres and zoos but also in foreign zoos around the world. China’s policy on panda export is very strict in order to protect their national symbol. A panda is never sold to a foreign country, but is instead on loan for a yearly fee of up to £650,000. There is also a clause that any cubs born during the loan belong to the People's Republic of China and have to be returned within two years. He got a quick response from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei regarding the islands, known to the Chinese as the Diaoyu. Speaking at a press conference in the capital the spokesman said: ‘Ishihara’s scheme to undermine China-Japan relations is a clumsy performance. It will only tarnish the image of Japan and Tokyo,’ ‘No matter what names the Japanese side gives, it cannot change the fact that the two pandas belong to China. ‘Likewise, what names Japan gives to the Diaoyu Island and the adjacent isles, it cannot change the fact that these islands belong to China.’ The zoo's panda team, comprised of five. workers and four veterinarians, will continue using two cameras to. observe the pair 24 hours a day for about a week, and have been joined. by a breeding expert from Sichuan, China, where Shin Shin grew up. Visitors to the zoo eager to see the. baby will be disappointed as Ueno Zoo, which is the oldest in Japan, has. expressed wishes to keep the cub and mother away from the public for. another six months. Shin Shin and her mate, Ri Ri, are on loan from China for 10 years. Under the terms of the agreement between Japan and China, the cub will be sent back in two years. Sad: Experts say pandas often struggle to conceive naturally, particularly when they are on public display. VIDEO: Staff from the UENO Zoo in Tokyo are visibly upset about the death of the panda... Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses the tragic death of a newborn panda cub at Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, just six days after its much-celebrated birth. The cub, which was the first naturally conceived panda in Japan's history, was found lying lifelessly on its mother's chest, likely having developed pneumonia. Ueno Zoo staff placed the cub back with its mother on Tuesday after keeping it in an incubator, but sadly, an hour-long attempt to resuscitate the panda by massaging its heart was unsuccessful. The birth of the panda cub was a significant achievement, as female pandas are only in heat for 72 hours each year, with a mere 24-hour window for successful conception. The birth and first moments of the cub were captured on a night vision webcam and then shared with the public. However, the unnamed cub was too young to have developed the characteristic black and white markings of a panda. The giant panda faces various threats, including habitat loss, poaching, and a low reproduction rate. Approximately 1,600 pandas live in the wild, with the majority being in China's Sichuan province, and around 300 live in captivity across Chinese breeding centers and zoos worldwide. The Chinese government exercises strict export policies for pandas, only permitting loans for a yearly fee and with the stipulation that any cubs born during the loan must be returned within two years. Unfortunately for eager visitors, Ueno Zoo plans to keep the mother and her cub away from public view for at least six months. The cub, if it had survived, would have been sent back to China two years after its birth under the terms of the loan agreement between the two countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Generate a 2-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.midisheetmusic. The answer is:","completion":"Title: Decent Concept, But Needs Improvement Review: I recently came across the app 'MidiSheetMusic' (com.midisheetmusic) and decided to give it a try as a fellow musician interested in making my sheet music more accessible on-the-go. Although the idea behind the app is commendable, my experience has been less than satisfactory, leading me to offer a 2-star rating. Upon first opening the app, it appeared promising, with a clean interface and options to import MIDI files and convert them into sheet music. The import function worked fairly well, and I appreciated how the app allowed me to browse and select MIDI files with ease. However, the app's issues began to surface as soon as I opened a MIDI file. The app claims to support multiple instrument tracks, which is essential for my ensemble pieces. However, I found that it had difficulty recognizing certain instruments in a track, which led to inaccuracies in transcribing and made my sheet music virtually unusable for certain musician friends. Additionally, the app regularly crashed when attempting to transcribe more complex pieces containing multiple instruments. Another significant issue I encountered was the app's poor rendering of sheet music. The app fails to adhere to standard musical notation conventions, leading to oddly-sized staves, inconsistent note spacing, and incorrect note lengths. These inconsistencies made it difficult to read and follow the music, which is quite frustrating for musicians of any level. A few additional features that would have been appreciated are the ability to edit sheet music within the app and export to a more popular and universal file format like PDF. The editing tools are virtually non-existent, so it's impossible to correct transcription errors or make minor tweaks to the sheet music. The app's inability to export the music in a usable format severely limits its functionality. Despite these shortcomings, the concept of the app is fantastic. The idea of having a mobile app to convert MIDI files into sheet music is undeniably appealing. If the developers could address the issues with transcription accuracy, enhance the sheet music rendering, and add robust editing tools and additional export formats, it has the potential to become an indispensable tool for musicians. In conclusion, while I cannot confidently recommend MidiSheetMusic in its current state, I believe that with improvements and a commitment to addressing user concerns, it could eventually develop into a valuable resource. Until then, I hope the developers take this feedback into consideration as they continue to work on the app."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Post-Katrina, Andy and Stan are now partners. They work with corrupt detectives Pepe and Barney, who are caught up in the murder of an undercover narcotics agent. Investigating the escalating police corruption in New Orleans is FBI Agent Brown. Brown brings up his thoughts to Police Captain Friendly who insists he is doing his best to solve the problems in his department. Meanwhile, police therapist Nina Ferraro tries to help the detectives with their struggles, with little avail. She is particularly interested in Andy, whose father, also a detective, was murdered in the line of duty. Things are complicated further with Agent Brown's investigation into Andy and his crew. Brown tells Andy that he has an informant who is leaking out the details, and Andy, disbelieving at first, begins to resign himself to the fact that one of his men is betraying him.

Debris from a comet's tail pierces the ship, waking the crew and killing the captain. The ship is knocked into the atmosphere of a nearby planet, and docking pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) tries to control the descent, but the rear-heavy craft will not stabilize. She begins jettisoning aft sections sequentially, and navigator Greg Owens (Simon Burke) realizes she intends to jettison the passenger cabin as well, saying, \\"I'm not gonna die for them.\\" He stops her by blocking the airlock, but in the sliding crash landing he is impaled by a metal shaft.Carolyn apologizes to Owens, whom she assumes is dead, but he screams after she uncovers him. She orders a passenger to fetch painkillers from the medical kit, but they are missing. With Owens in terrible pain, Carolyn orders everyone out of the ship, and alone attends to him as he dies.The planet is a barren and hot desert-scape lit by three suns, promising everlasting daylight.

A:","completion":"The creatures that the survivors of the crashed \\"Hunter-Gratzner\\" vessel encounter in the 2000 movie \\"Pitch Black\\" are referred to as bio-raptors. These bio-raptors are a nocturnal species native to the dark world of the planet M6-117, a barren and hot desert-scape lit by three suns. This unique lifeform thrives under conditions of total darkness and is incapable of venturing out during the periods of daylight. The three suns of the planet effectively create a condition of perpetual daylight, which drives these creatures to stay underground for their survival. A key feature of these bio-raptors is that they possess a highly acute sense of hearing, but are otherwise blind. They navigate their environment and locate their prey using a form of echolocation, which works effectively in the deep underground caves and tunnels, but not in well-lit open spaces. Thus, the bio-raptors have adapted to live underground as a survival strategy. Furthermore, in daylight, they are not only blind but also physically vulnerable. Their bodies are not built to withstand the fierce heat and radiation from the triple suns above ground, so they hide in the underground cavities during the day and only come out when darkness falls. The movie's plot thickens when the survivors find out that a total eclipse is imminent, which would plunge the planet into total darkness. This triggers the emergence of the bio-raptors from their underground lairs. The subsequent struggle for survival by the ship’s crash survivors against the onslaught of the bio-raptors constitutes the heart of the movie's narrative. Ultimately, the bio-raptors in Pitch Black stay underground due to their specific adaptations and survival strategies linked to their inherent biological limitations and the unique environmental features of their harsh and unforgiving planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a recent article in The Guardian newspaper noted, \\"There's more to understanding a joke in a foreign language than understanding vocabulary and grammar.\\" Being able to understand local jokes is often seen as an incredible ice-breaker for a language learner eager to form friendships with native speakers. \\"I always felt that humor was a ceiling that I could never break through,\\" Hannah Ashley, a public relations account manager in London, who once studied Spanish in Madrid. Told The Guardian, \\"I could never speak to people on the same level as I would speak to a native English speaker. I almost came across as quite a boring person because all I could talk about was facts.\\" In fact, most of the time, jokes are only funny for people who share a cultural background or understand humor in the same way. Chinese-American comedian Joe Wong found this out first-hand. He had achieved huge success in the US, but when he returned to China in 2008 for his first live show in Beijing, he discovered that people didn't think his. Chinese jokes were as funny as his English ones. In Australia, meanwhile many foreigners find understanding jokes about sports to be the biggest headache. \\"The hardest jokes are related to rugby because I know nothing about rugby,\\" said Melody Cao, who was once a student in Australia. \\"When I heard jokes I didn't get, I just laughed along.\\" In the other two major English-speaking countries, the sense of humor is also different. British comedian Simon Pegg believes that while Britons use irony-basically, saying something they don't mean to make a joke-every day, people in the US don't see the point of using it so often. \\"British jokes tend to be more subtle and dark, while American jokes are more obvious with their meanings, a bit like Americans themselves,\\" he wrote in The Guardian. The writer quoted the sentence, \\"There's more to understanding a joke in a foreign language than under standing vocabulary and grammar.\\" to show that _ . A) making jokes can help you make friends with native speakers B) local jokes can help you to understand the local culture better. C) understanding jokes requires a good knowledge of vocabulary and grammar. D) to understand its jokes, you'd better lean the culture.","completion":"D) To understand jokes in a foreign language, it's better to learn the culture. The quote mentioned in The Guardian suggests that just knowing vocabulary and grammar isn't enough for understanding jokes in a foreign language. Humor often relies on cultural references, shared experiences, and local manners of expression. As the examples provided indicate, different countries and regions have their own unique forms of humor, which can sometimes only be understood or appreciated by those who are familiar with that particular culture. Understanding the culture behind jokes can help language learners connect better with native speakers and grasp the nuances of humor in that language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After his mother died, his family moved in with his grandmother, who died when Kulwicki was in seventh grade. A year later, his only brother died of a hemophilia-related illness. Kulwicki attended Pius XI High School, a Roman Catholic high school in Milwaukee, and received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1977. Kulwicki died in an airplane crash on Thursday April 1, 1993. He was returning from an appearance at the Knoxville Hooters in a Hooters corporate plane on a short flight across Tennessee before the Sunday spring race at Bristol. The plane slowed and crashed just before final approach at Tri-Cities Regional Airport near Blountville. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the crash to the pilot's failure to use the airplane's anti-ice system to clear ice from the engine inlet system. Kulwicki was buried at St. Adalbert's Cemetery in Milwaukee; the funeral was attended by NASCAR President Bill France, Jr. and numerous drivers. Kulwicki's racecar transporter was driven from the rainy track later that Friday morning while other teams and the media watched it travel slowly around the track with a black wreath on its grille. In 2008, Kyle Petty described the slow laps as \\"the saddest thing I've ever seen at a racetrack... We just sat and cried.\\" Kulwicki had competed in five NASCAR races that season with two Top 5 finishes, and was ranked ninth in points at his death. In his career, he had won five NASCAR Winston Cup races, 24 pole positions, 75 Top 10 finishes, and one championship in 207 races. His car was driven by road course specialist Tommy Kendall on road courses and by Jimmy Hensley at the other tracks. It was raced for most of the 1993 season until the team was sold to Geoff Bodine, who operated it as Geoff Bodine Racing. Kulwicki had been selected to compete in the 1993 International Race of Champions (IROC) series as the reigning Winston Cup champion. He competed in two IROC races before his death, finishing ninth at Daytona and eleventh at Darlington. Dale Earnhardt raced for Kulwicki in the final two IROC races, and the prize money for those races and their fifth place combined points finish was given to the Winston Cup Racing Wives Auxiliary, Brenner Children's Hospital and St. Thomas Aquinas Church charities.

Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"less effect. In the event of a big fire, the amount of available oxygen in the surrounding environment will be significantly reduced as the fire will consume a large quantity of it. This means that there will be less oxygen available for the cells in the body to obtain through breathing. Due to the decreased oxygen availability, it becomes more difficult for the cells to obtain adequate oxygen required for the process mentioned above. Therefore, the second effect mentioned – the creation of carbon dioxide – may also be affected as the cells won't be able to produce as much energy through the oxidation of glucose without enough oxygen.

Yen was born in Guangzhou, China. His mother, Bow-sim Mark, is a Fu Style Wudangquan (internal martial arts) and Tai Chi grandmaster, while his father, Klyster Yen (Zhen Yun Long ), is a newspaper editor. When he was two years old, his family moved to Hong Kong and then to Boston when he was 11. His younger sister, Chris Yen, is also a martial artist and actress, and appeared in the 2007 film Adventures of Johnny Tao: Rock Around the Dragon. Yen describes himself as a mixed martial artist. He learned Tai Chi from a young age under his mother's tutelage. He then wanted to learn Taekwondo in his teenage years, earning a 6th Dan in the process. At the time, the Beijing Wushu Team had a scout in the United States and invited Yen over to Beijing, China, where he began training at the Beijing Sports Institute, the same facility where champion-turned-actor Jet Li trained; this is where the two of them crossed paths for the first time. Upon his return to the United States, Yen won gold medals in various wushu competitions. Yen later went on to discover and seek knowledge on other martial arts styles; he would later obtain black and purple belts from judo and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, respectively, and went on to study the art of Parkour, Wrestling, Muay Thai, Kickboxing and Boxing under various trainers. His exposure to mixed martial arts (MMA) was heightened when he went back to the United States from 2000 to 2003. While making his Hollywood debut, he also took time off to learn the various martial arts forms. Yen's progress was evident when he returned to Asia, where he implemented his newfound knowledge of MMA, showcased in films such as SPL: Sha Po Lang (2005), Flash Point (2007), and Special ID (2013). Near the end of 2007, Yen added a new martial arts system to his arsenal. He was offered the role of Wing Chun grandmaster and mentor of film star Bruce Lee, Ip Man, in a 2008 film named after the grandmaster. He worked hard and studied Wing Chun under Ip Man's eldest son, Ip Chun, for 9 months before tackling the role. Ip Chun has since praised Yen for his effort, his skills as a martial artist, and his ability to grasp the full concept of Wing Chun much faster than anyone else he has taught. Yen believes that combining many martial arts together will produce the most effective and harmonious style. Yen has said, \\"When you watch my films, you're feeling my heart.\\" He believes in practical combat, and in his opinion, MMA is the most authentic type of practical combat. He has mentioned that he would have competed in the Ultimate Fighting Championship if he did not have a recurring shoulder injury.","completion":"This text is about Yen, a mixed martial artist, and actor, known for his various accomplishments and skills in martial arts and for his roles in films such as SPL: Sha Po Lang, Flash Point, and Special ID.

So why don't people worry as much about oil prices changing? Well, there are a few reasons. One is that there are a lot of new ways to make oil, like using the sun, wind, and even giant fans called wind turbines. Also, in the past few years, we have better cars and engines that don't need as much oil. Because we're using less oil, we don't worry as much when the prices change. Now, let's look at the special picture called a chart that shows how much the prices have changed. Imagine a line that goes a little bit up and down as you move from left to right. This is what the chart looks like, and it's telling us that as years go by, the ups and downs in oil prices don't make people as worried as they used to. What does this mean for you, and other people in the United States? Well, it means that even if oil prices change, we can still keep driving our cars, buses, and trucks without getting too worried. We have found new ways to save energy, which is good for the Earth! So next time you hear about oil prices on the news or from your parents, you don't have to worry as much.

Please answer the following question: Information: - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of... - The National Peasants' Party (\\"Partidul Naional rnesc\\" or \\"PN\\") was a Romanian political party, formed in 1926 through the fusion of the Romanian National Party from Transylvania and the Peasants' Party from the prewar kingdom. It was in power for most of the time between 1928 and 1933 with longtime leader Iuliu Maniu as prime minister. A moderately conservative party, with some left-wing corporatist views (supporting, for instance, voluntary cooperative farming), it remained staunchly pro-monarchy. - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU. - The Second Spanish Republic (in Spanish: \\"Segunda República Española\\") was the republican regime that existed in Spain from 1931 to 1939, preceded by the Restoration and followed by Francoist Spain after the Spanish Civil War. - The Spanish Civil War, widely known in Spain simply as The Civil War or The War, took place from 1936 to 1939 and was fought between the Republicans, who were loyal to the democratic, left-leaning and a relatively urban Second Spanish Republic in an alliance of convenience with the Anarchists, versus the Nationalists, a falangist, Carlist and a largely aristocratic conservative group led by General Francisco Franco. Although the war is often portrayed as a struggle between democracy and fascism, some historians consider it more accurately described as a struggle between leftist revolution and rightist counterrevolution. Ultimately, the Nationalists won, and Franco then ruled Spain for the next 36 years, from April 1939 until his death in November 1975. - Ion I.

I am looking for jobs in Qatar, so I would like to know how to get Grade A certification in Architecture.\\" What is the impression of lower grade students in getting jobs? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question seeks information about the meaning of 'Architect Grade A' and the process of obtaining Grade A certification in Architecture in Qatar. The second question is about the perception of lower-grade architecture students in the job market. To address the first question: 'Architect Grade A' refers to a classification system used in some countries to evaluate and categorize the professional competence of architects. In Qatar, a Grade A Architect is a highly qualified professional who has demonstrated a high level of proficiency, expertise, and experience in the field of architecture. To become a Grade A certified architect in Qatar, here is a general outline of the steps you need to follow: 1. Education: Obtain a bachelor's or master's degree in architecture from a recognized institution. It is crucial to note that the specific academic requirements may vary depending on the local regulatory body's standards in Qatar. 2. Professional Experience: Gain relevant work experience in architecture through internships, work placements, or full-time employment. Usually, several years of practical experience are required before one can apply for Grade A certification. 3. Licensing Exam: Prepare and successfully pass the local licensing examination, often administered by a regulatory body like the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), to ensure that candidates meet Qatar's professional and technical standards. 4. Continuing Professional Development (CPD): Engage in ongoing learning and professional development courses to stay up-to-date with industry trends, regulations, and advancements in the field of architecture. 5. Application Process: Submit an application for Grade A certification to the relevant regulatory body, including your education and experience credentials, along with any other required documentation. Now, to address the second question: Lower grade architecture students or professionals may face certain challenges when entering the job market, especially when compared to their Grade A counterparts. The perception of lower-grade architects can vary, but some common themes include: 1. Limited job opportunities: Graduates with lower grades or less experience may find fewer job openings available to them, as firms often favor more experienced and highly-graded professionals. 2. Lower salaries and benefits: The remuneration package offered to lower-grade architects is likely to be less competitive than what their Grade A counterparts receive. 3. Slower career growth: Lower grade architects may experience slower career progression and may need to put in considerable effort and time to prove their competency and stand out from their more highly-graded peers. 4. Perception issues: Unfortunately, lower-grade architects may sometimes be perceived as less competent or skilled compared to their higher-grade counterparts, even if this is not necessarily the case. Overcoming this perception may require demonstrating strong work ethics, dedication, and a commitment to professional growth. It is essential for lower-grade architecture professionals to focus on developing their skills, gaining practical experience, and participating in continuing education courses to enhance their employability and increase their chances of career success in the competitive job market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: David works for the government as a statistician. He had to produce a report for the coming annual meeting. This year he is thinking about a report with some lifestyle suggestions for middle adulthood population. To make it easier to understand the needs of middle adulthood population he would compare it with a group who are in their twenties. He labeled the first group as group A; and the latter group as group B. Would group B have faster or slower reaction time than group A? Hint: Middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood. Answer:","completion":"To answer the question of whether group B (people in their twenties) would have faster or slower reaction time than group A (middle adulthood population), let's consider the information given and think step-by-step. 1. Middle adulthood population is defined as people from mid-30s to mid-60s. We know that during this stage of life, physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair, start to appear. Furthermore, vision, strength, and reaction time begin to decline. 2. Group B consists of people in their twenties. This group is younger than the middle adulthood population and has not yet experienced the significant age-related decline in physical abilities. 3. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during the stage of middle adulthood. While these diseases do not directly impact reaction time, poor health can contribute to an overall decline in physical performance, including reaction time. Based on this information, we can conclude that group B (people in their twenties) would likely have a faster reaction time than group A (middle adulthood population), as the younger individuals have not yet experienced the age-related decline in physical abilities, including reaction time, which typically occurs during middle adulthood."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Context: Maximilian's death in 1519 brought the Imperial election to the forefront of European politics. Pope Leo X, threatened by the presence of Spanish troops a mere forty miles from the Vatican, supported the French candidacy. The prince-electors themselves, with the exception of Frederick of Saxony, who refused to countenance the campaigning, promised their support to both candidates at once. Before his death, Maximilian had already promised sums of 500,000 florins to the Electors in exchange for their votes, but Francis offered up to three million, and Charles retaliated by borrowing vast sums from the Fuggers. The final outcome, however, was not determined by the exorbitant bribes, which included Leo promising to make the Archbishop of Mainz his permanent legate. The general outrage of the populace at the idea of a French Emperor gave the Electors pause, and when Charles put an army in the field near Frankfurt, where they were meeting, the Electors obligingly voted for him. He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 23 October 1520, by which point he already controlled both the Spanish crown and the hereditary Burgundian lands in the Low Countries. Cardinal Wolsey, hoping to increase Henry VIII's influence on the continent, offered the services of England as a mediator for the various disputes between Francis and Charles. Henry and Francis staged an extravagant meeting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Immediately afterwards, Wolsey entertained Charles in Calais. Following the meetings, Wolsey, concerned mainly with improving his own stature in preparation for the next papal conclave, proceeded to stage a hollow arbitration conference at Calais, which lasted until April 1522 to no practical effect.

The Pyramid of Neferirkare (in ancient Egyptian the Ba of Neferirkare) was built for the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai – referred to as Neferirkare – in the 25th century BC. It was the tallest structure located on the highest site at the necropolis of Abusir – found between Giza and Saqqara – and still towers over the necropolis today. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir papyri. The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom. Pyramids of the era were smaller and becoming more standardized, though intricate relief decoration also proliferated. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid: a design that had been antiquated after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). This was then encased in a second step pyramid with alterations intended to convert it into a true pyramid; however, the pharaoh's death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: After you return their shot, return to the middle of the court, so if they hit it to your left or right, you have more time to react and run to their shot, and return it back. Stay on your toes, and slightly move left and right ,so your energy and momentum is still active and you can be ready to run for the next move. This stance means that your feet should be even with your shoulders and parallel and your toes should be pointed toward the net. Keep your knees bent slightly and your racket in your hand with your arm across the front of your body. Don't stand as if you were just normally standing up, or your body will be far too stiff to move well. Be prepared to run up to the net, run cross court, back up all the way to the back service line, or to reach the shuttle from any position. The element of surprise is important here, too, so watch out for your opponent's tricks. The overhead smash is the most powerful shot in the game because it allows you to hit the shuttle as hard and fast as you can, making it as difficult as possible for your opponent to return your shot. Look for opportunities to hit this shot when the shuttle is being returned high in the air. Don't hit the shuttle right back to your opponent every time, or you'll just be making it easier for him or her to hit the shuttle right back. Your goal should be to move your opponent or opponents up and down the court or back and forth across the court so they get winded and tired and don't have the opportunity to properly return the shuttle. Don't just aim to hit the shuttle back and hope that your opponent messes up; have an idea of where you're going to hit it, how you're going to hit it, and why you're going to hit it a certain way. If you just blindly swing at the shuttle, you won't get very far. If you want to win, then you have to make your opponent play your game and make him as uncomfortable as possible. If your opponent has a weak backhand (as most beginners tend to have), hit the shuttle repeatedly toward his backhand. If he's slow on his feet, move him around. If he loves to play near the net, hit your shots long and hard. If your opponent loves the smash shot, don't hit the shuttle in the air. Be attuned to your opponent's strengths and weaknesses so you can win as easily as possible. It's important to observe your opponent closely. Whether you're starting a game or just rallying for fun, be on the lookout for your opponent's strengths and weaknesses as early as possible.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the location where Richard II began his procession? , can you please find it? When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in St John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup, Henry IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed.Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York. The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton. With the help of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (nicknamed \\"the Kingmaker\\")... A:","completion":"The full name of the location where Richard II began his procession was the Tower of London. This historically significant structure served as the starting point for his journey to Westminster Abbey for his coronation in 1377. The Tower of London was not only an important part of the royal procession, but also played a key role in the life and reign of Richard II. It served as the king's refuge during times of civil unrest, was the site of his imprisonment, and was central to many other key events during the course of Richard's rule and the broader historical context of the time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Underground, molten rock (magma) is generated.\\" Here is the justification for this step: This process describes a volcanic eruption, which in its simplest form has about five steps. 1. Generation of magma in the Earth’s crust: Magma is generated by partial melting of rocks in the Earth's mantle and its crust. The heat necessary to melt the rocks is primarily from the Earth’s core. 2. The magma accumulates in a magma chamber: The magma slowly pushes its way up, creating immense pressure. 3. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: Under the pressure, the gases in the magma expand and push the magma up. 4. The magma cools: When the magma reaches the surface, it's called lava, and cools off to form igneous rocks. 5. With enough time the pressure builds up greatly: As more and more magma pushes up, and as more gas builds up, the pressure can lead to a tremendous explosion. 6. The resulting volcano may explode: The accumulated pressure can cause the volcano to erupt. Therefore, if we look at this sequence, we can see that we have steps 2 to 6 in the question.

According to the 2000 edition of a popular physical anthropology textbook, forensic anthropologists are overwhelmingly in support of the idea of the basic biological reality of human races. Forensic physical anthropologist and professor George W. Gill has said that the idea that race is only skin deep \\"is simply not true, as any experienced forensic anthropologist will affirm\\" and \\"Many morphological features tend to follow geographic boundaries coinciding often with climatic zones. This is not surprising since the selective forces of climate are probably the primary forces of nature that have shaped human races with regard not only to skin color and hair form but also the underlying bony structures of the nose, cheekbones, etc. (For example, more prominent noses humidify air better.)\\" While he can see good arguments for both sides, the complete denial of the opposing evidence \\"seems to stem largely from socio-political motivation and not science at all\\".

This year was momentous for her due to the publication of her first novel, \\"Jane Eyre.\\" Not only did this event mark the beginning of Charlotte Bronte's career as an esteemed author, but it also impacted the literary world significantly. Born in 1816, Charlotte Bronte was the third of six children in her family. She was raised in a rural English parsonage and educated largely by her father, Patrick Bronte, and her aunt, Elizabeth Branwell. Charlotte's mother, Maria, had passed away when she was very young, leaving her father to care for the children alongside her aunt. At the age of 20, Charlotte served as a governess for several years, an experience that would later inform her novel \\"Jane Eyre.\\" In 1846, Charlotte, along with her sisters Emily and Anne, published a collection of poetry under the gender-neutral pseudonyms, Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. The collection, titled \\"Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell,\\" did not reach commercial success but helped the sisters test the waters of the literary world. However, this marked the beginning of their courageous journey as women writers in a male-dominated field. In 1847, Charlotte started to attract the attention of publishers and submitted her manuscript for \\"The Professor\\" to various firms. Sadly, it was rejected several times, but in that same year, another publisher, Smith, Elder & Co. took an interest in her and requested another novel from Charlotte. This led to the submission and eventual publication of \\"Jane Eyre.\\" \\"Jane Eyre\\" is largely considered to be semi-autobiographical, drawing on incidents and environments from Charlotte Bronte's life. For instance, the boarding school that the protagonist, Jane Eyre, attends parallels Charlotte’s experience at the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge, a harsh and disciplinary institution. Additionally, during her time as a governess, Charlotte was deeply in love with a married man, her employer – a situation she embeds in her novel through Jane's relationship with Mr. Rochester. Published on October 16, 1847, \\"Jane Eyre\\" became an instant success. It was quickly hailed as a literary masterpiece, garnering positive reviews and praise from George Henry Lewes, William Makepeace Thackeray, and Elizabeth Gaskell. Gaskell would later become a close friend of Charlotte and write her biography, \\"The Life of Charlotte Bronte,\\" in 1857. In 1847, Charlotte's sisters Emily and Anne also published their novels, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" and \\"Agnes Grey,\\" under their respective pseudonyms. Sadly, both Emily and Anne would pass away within three years of the publishing, leaving Charlotte as the only surviving author among the sisters. 1847 was indeed a turning point in Charlotte Bronte's life, as it thrust her and her sisters into the limelight, transforming them from three unknown Yorkshire spinsters into literary giants of their era. Charlotte would go on to write additional novels, like \\"Shirley\\" (1849) and \\"Villette\\" (1853), further cementing her status as a respected and influential author of the 19th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS and later DVD. It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers (e.g., Timex Sinclair 1000) and video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s. In the 2010s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays, especially LED-backlit LCDs, largely replaced cathode ray tubes and other displays. - NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s.

It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation. - Live television is a television production broadcast in real-time, as events happen, in the present. Shows broadcast live include newscasts, morning shows, awards shows, sports programs, and, occasionally, episodes of television series. Live television was more common until the late 1950s, when videotape technology was invented. Because of the prohibitive cost, adoption was slow, and some television show remained live until the 1970s, such as soap operas. To prevent unforeseen issues, live television programs may be delayed, which allows censors to edit the program. Some programs may be broadcast live in certain time zones and delayed in others. - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound.

Other types of acts include magic, animal and circus acts, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio to television. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from its early days (late 1940s) into the 1980s. - Lorne Michaels (born Lorne Lipowitz; November 17, 1944) is a Canadian-American television producer, writer, comedian, and actor, best known for creating and producing \\"Saturday Night Live\\", and producing the \\"Late Night\\" series (since 1993), and \\"The Tonight Show\\" (since 2014). - The Colbert Report is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News' \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\". \\"The Colbert Report\\" is a spin-off of Comedy Central's \\"The Daily Show\\", where he acted as a correspondent for the program for several years while developing the character. - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show currently broadcast from the Rockefeller Center in New York City (and previously from various studios in the Los Angeles region) and airing on NBC since 1954. It is the world's longest-running talk show, and the longest running, regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows \\"Today\\" and \\"Meet the Press\\". - A late-night talk show is a genre of talk show popular in the US, structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances.

Many late night talk shows feature a house band which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during commercial breaks and occasionally will back up a guest artist. - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden. - A cold open (also called a teaser) in a television program or movie is the technique of jumping directly into a story at the beginning or opening of the show before the title sequence or opening credits are shown. On television, this is often done on the theory that involving the audience in the plot as soon as possible will reduce the likelihood of their switching away from a show during the opening commercial. A cold open may summarize events in previous episodes or storylines that will be revisited during the current episode. - The Daily Show is an American news satire and late-night talk show television program hosted by Trevor Noah. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. Describing itself as a fake news program, \\"The Daily Show\\" draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor as well. - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\". - In theatre (especially in the illusionistic Western tradition), breaking character occurs when an actor ceases to maintain the illusion that they are identical with the character they are portraying.

Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices. - Duncan \\"Dick\\" Ebersol (born July 28, 1947) is an American television executive and a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports & Olympics. He had previously been the chairman of NBC Sports, producing large scale television events such as the Olympic Games and National Football League broadcasts. - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center. The network is part of the Big Three television networks.

It is the show's longest-running recurring sketch, having been on since the show's first broadcast, and is typically presented in the middle of the show immediately after the first musical performance. One or two of the players are cast in the role of news anchor, presenting gag news items based on and acting as hosts for occasional editorials, commentaries, or other performances by other cast members or guests. Chevy Chase has credited Weekend Update, which he started as anchor in 1975, for paving the way for comedic news shows like \\"The Daily Show\\" and \\"The Colbert Report\\". - Cornelius Crane \\"Chevy\\" Chase (born October 8, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, writer and producer. Born into a prominent New York family, he worked a plethora of strange jobs before moving into comedy and began acting with \\"National Lampoon\\".

Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.

Some writers work from an oral tradition. - Meet the Press is a weekly American television news/interview program that is broadcast on NBC. It is the longest-running program in U.S. television history, though its current format bears little resemblance to the one it debuted with on November 6, 1947. Like similar shows that have followed it, \\"Meet the Press\\" specializes in interviews with national leaders on issues of politics, economics, foreign policy and other public affairs, along with panel discussions that provide opinions and analysis. It originates from NBC's Washington, D.C. studios. - Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color.

Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - Rockefeller Center is a large complex consisting of 19 highrise commercial buildings covering between 48th and 51st Streets in New York City.

The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection. - Bye Bye Braverman is a 1968 American comedy film directed by Sidney Lumet. The screenplay by Herbert Sargent was adapted from the 1964 novel \\"To an Early Grave\\" by Wallace Markfield. - A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh.

The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\", properly beginning the show. - Screenwriting, also called scriptwriting, is the art and craft of writing scripts for mass media such as feature films, television productions or video games. It is frequently a freelance profession. - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.

Alcantara committed his crimes in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, and there's a legendary rivalry between New York Yankees fans and the Boston Red Sox fans who live in New England. Alcantara, assuming the Rhode Island jury that convicted him was full of Red Sox fans, appealed his five-year sentence on the basis that (among other things) his Yankees cap was mentioned multiple times during the trial and must have prejudiced the jury. However, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has rejected that claim, USA Today reports. His conviction was upheld, per Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly. Expand this summary.","completion":"David Alcantara's conviction for bank fraud and conspiracy to counterfeit currency has been upheld by the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, despite his attempt to blame the outcome on his choice of headwear—a New York Yankees baseball cap. Alcantara committed his crimes in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, three states that make up part of New England, where the legendary sporting rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox runs deep. He assumed that wearing a Yankees cap would prejudice a Rhode Island jury composed largely of Red Sox fans, and so used this as the basis for appealing his five-year sentence. Throughout the trial, the Yankees cap was mentioned multiple times, further fueling Alcantara's belief that it played a role in his conviction. However, it's important to note that the evidence against him and the severity of his crimes far outweighed any potential influence his cap might have had on the jury. Alcantara was convicted for committing serious financial crimes in multiple states. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ultimately rejected Alcantara's claim that his cap played a role in his conviction, as reported by USA Today and Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly. This decision highlights the fact that legal outcomes are based on the evidence presented and the severity of the crimes committed by the defendant, not on the personal preferences or biases of jury members. Moreover, the court's decision to uphold the conviction signals the justice system's focus on ensuring fair trial procedures. The court must have been confident enough that Alcantara was provided a fair trial, which is a crucial aspect of the legal system in the United States. In conclusion, David Alcantara's attempt to blame his conviction on his New York Yankees baseball cap, while interesting from a cultural perspective, ultimately proved futile. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit maintained that his five-year sentence was a result of the evidence presented against him, combined with the severity of his crimes, and not swayed by his choice of headwear during the trial. This decision showcases the dedication to delivering fair and just trials without personal biases in the United States' legal system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Make sure you have all of these before visiting an institution to avoid repeated visits. Government identification. A state-issued driver's license or passport is usually required. School or work ID's are not sufficient here. Your social security number. It is best to have this number memorized. If you don't know it by heart and have to write it down, be sure not to lose it and destroy it after you're done. Also don't put your name or any other information on the paper it's written on, just in case you do lose it. You should also check with the specific bank before you visit to see if they require any other proof or documentation. This will avoid repeated trips to open your account. Whichever account you decide to open, it will probably have a minimum account balance. If you don't meet that minimum you'll be charged a fee. You're often given a day or so to make a deposit and bring the account up to the minimum before you're charged. You can take care of this right when you open the account if you bring the minimum amount with you. When you have your documents together, visit the branch and speak to a representative. Usually tellers don't handle opening accounts, so you'll probably be referred to one of the bank managers or financial consultants. He or she will speak with you about the account you're opening and counsel you on what options are best. Plan to ask the representative any questions you might have. Explain your financial and banking situation to the representative. With this information at hand, the representative can assess your needs and may be able to recommend options you didn't think of before. If you've investigated the kinds of checking accounts the institution offers, mention them. The representative will be able to talk you through the pros and cons of each account. Ask about any fees associated with the account, as well as the minimum balance required. Ask if you can manage your banking online or over the phone. Most banks offer these services. They are much more convenient than having to visit the branch every time you need to handle your account.

Answer the following question: - Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried through your body - At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon dioxide - Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas back to the lungs where it is removed from the blood stream and then exhaled - Your lungs and respiratory system automatically perform this vital process, called gas exchange - What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the gas exchange process is the inhalation of oxygen-rich air into the lungs. During inhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, causing the chest cavity to expand and draw air into the lungs, filling the alveoli with oxygen-rich air. This process allows the oxygen to be readily available for the next steps of gas exchange, where it will eventually be absorbed into the bloodstream and carried throughout the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What was the last name of the person who painted an enormous panoramic painting? Answer the above question based on the context below: The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.The imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north.","completion":"The last name of the person who painted the enormous panoramic painting is Zeduan.

Multi-select: Knowing that \\"as the amount of available water decreases , tree-growth rings will become narrower\\", how would one answer \\"As a result of decreased water, what will happen to tree rings?\\" Select from the following. [a]. Lose shape [b]. Become narrow [c]. Become wider [d]. Disappear Completely...A:","completion":"As a result of decreased water, tree rings will [b]. Become narrow. Water is a critical resource for the growth and development of trees. Trees depend on water for various processes, including photosynthesis, nutrient transportation, and structural support. When water is plentiful, trees can grow and develop at an optimal rate, resulting in wider growth rings. However, when the amount of available water decreases, the impact on tree growth is significant. The statement \\"as the amount of available water decreases, tree-growth rings will become narrower\\" is an accurate reflection of the relationship between water availability and tree ring development. Here's a detailed explanation of why tree rings become narrower with decreased water availability: 1. Reduced growth rate: When there is less water available, trees are not able to photosynthesize and produce food at their maximum capacity. As a result, their overall growth rate decreases. This reduced growth rate is reflected in the size of the growth rings, with narrower rings corresponding to seasons of limited water availability. 2. Decreased nutrient transportation: Water also plays a critical role in the transportation of nutrients within trees. Without sufficient water, trees cannot transport nutrients effectively, leading to a lack of resources for growth and development. The slowed development causes the growth rings to become narrower. 3. Stress response: A lack of available water can also put trees under significant stress. In response to water stress, trees may divert their limited resources to vital functions such as survival and reproduction, rather than growth. This conservatory measure results in narrower growth rings for the stressed trees. 4. Secondary effects: The impact of limited water availability can extend beyond the immediate water shortage. For example, drought stress can render trees more susceptible to pests and diseases, further hindering growth and contributing to narrower tree rings. In conclusion, when water availability decreases, tree growth rings become narrower because of reduced growth rates, decreased nutrient transportation, stress responses, and secondary effects related to water stress. This phenomenon can be observed in multiple tree species, making it a valuable tool for studying historical climate patterns and understanding the effects of droughts on ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For example: \\"(Winken, Blinken, & Nod, 1992).\\" Put a comma after the year, then write \\"p.\\" if the information appears on a single page or \\"pp.\\" if it appears on multiple pages or a range of pages. Finish with the page number, then add a period after the closing parentheses. For instance: \\"(Simpson, 1988, p. 76).\\" Alternatively: \\"(Simpson, 1988, p. 76; Cleaver, 1992, pp. 103-119).\\" Sometimes your writing flows better if you name the author of the work in your text directly in your sentence. When you do this, you don't need to follow up with a parenthetical citation. If you have the author's name in the text of the sentence, simply put the date of publication (or writing) in parentheses after the author's name. If there is more than 1 author, use the word \\"and\\" rather than an ampersand if their names appear in the text. For example: \\"According to Simpson (1988), dogs don't dream. However, the work of Winken, Blinken, and Nod (1992) provides evidence that they do.\\"","completion":"This article explains the proper format for in-text citations, including author names, publication years, and page numbers, with examples and variations for different writing styles and multi-author sources."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Q: Context: The FAS/FASLG system has been proposed to play a key role in germ cell apoptosis. To elucidate the role of the genetic variants of cell death pathway genes in male infertility, we genotyped the polymorphisms of FAS, FASLG and caspase-8 (CASP8) genes and evaluated their effects on sperm apoptosis and semen quality in infertile men.', 'The genotypes of FAS, FASLG and CASP8 were determined in 620 infertile men. Sperm apoptosis rates were measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Tdt)-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay, and the semen quality analysis was performed using computer assisted sperm analysis.', 'We found that polymorphisms of FAS-670A/G (rs1800682: A>G) and CASP8-652 6N ins/del (rs3834129: -/CTTACT) were associated with sperm apoptosis and semen quality. Individuals with FAS-670GG showed low apoptosis rate and decreased sperm concentration, compared with the FAS-670AA genotype. Similarly, in comparison with the CASP8-652 6N ins/ins genotype, the CASP8-652 6N (ins/del+del/del) genotypes also showed significantly decreased sperm apoptosis rate and poor sperm motility. Other polymorphisms investigated did not appear to affect sperm apoptosis and semen quality. Answer: This study showed for the first time that functional variants of FAS and CASP8 might contribute to the dysfunctional apoptotic mechanism in germ cells, which could result in poor semen quality of ejaculated sperm.

The premise states that in 1976, Beatty faced pleas, presumably from supporters or political allies, to enter the primary race and challenge Jimmy Carter. The use of the word \\"resisted\\" indicates that Beatty did not give in to these requests, and therefore did not participate in a late primary challenge against Jimmy Carter. It is important to analyze the context and wording of the premise to accurately determine the truth of a hypothesis. In this case, the key phrases \\"resisted pleas\\" and \\"late primary challenge\\" are essential to understanding the situation. By resisting the pleas, Beatty chose not to enter the primary race at a later stage, even though there were supporters who wanted him to do so. This confirms the hypothesis and highlights the importance of careful reading and understanding of a given statement.

After she awakens from one, she looks at her dream journal, which includes drawings detailing characters and events from the first film; during this, she recalls a vision that picks up immediately where the first film ended: after the Tall Man's minions attacked Mike through his bedroom mirror, Reggie heard the commotion and ran upstairs to his aid. He tried to get a shotgun, but was attacked by Lurkers and had to flee, although he managed to surreptitiously snuff the pilot lights on the stove. Once upstairs, he dodged the Tall Man and rescued Mike, and the two dove out of the bedroom window to escape as the gas fumes reached the living room fireplace and destroyed the house. Following this, Liz pleads for Mike to find her, as she fears that when her grandfather dies, the Tall Man will take him.Having been institutionalized as delusional since the first film, Mike feels he can no longer ignore Liz's dream pleas, and fakes his recovery to obtain a doctor's release. At night, he returns to Morningside Cemetery to exhume bodies and is interrupted by Reggie who tells him that the attack at the beginning of the film never occurred. Mike reveals that the coffins he dug up are empty and urges Reggie to help him hunt the Tall Man down. En route to Reggie's house, Mike receives a vision of an impending gas explosion, and frantically tries to warn Reggie seconds before his house is consumed in an explosion, killing his wife Celeste, daughter Bonnie, and Aunt Marta.

Now, let's examine the differences: 1. In the first sentence, the phrase \\"pay attention to\\" is used, whereas, in the second sentence, \\"take into account\\" is used. Both phrases essentially convey the same idea: that the court should be aware of and factor in the legal opinions from other world courts. However, \\"take into account\\" suggests a slightly more formal or direct consideration of those opinions. 2. When referring to the European Court of Human Rights, the first sentence uses \\"such as,\\" which implies that the European Court of Human Rights is an example of other world courts whose opinions might be taken into consideration. In the second sentence, the word \\"like\\" is used, which also implies a similar meaning, but with a slightly less formal tone.

The problem we have to solve is 19 - 36 = 5*c - 67. Firstly, let's simplify the left side of the equation (the part before the \\"=\\"). 19 minus 36 gives us -17. So now, our equation looks like -17 = 5*c - 67. Then let's go to the right side of equals sign (the \\"=\\"). We will get rid of the \\"-67\\" next to the 5*c. We can do this by adding 67 to both sides of the equation. So, when we add 67 to -17 on the left, we get 50. On the right, 5*c - 67 + 67 simplifies to 5*c because -67 and +67 cancel out each other, like when two friends who are playing tag become 'it' and then aren't 'it' anymore. So now the equation looks like 50 = 5*c. Lastly, to find out what 'c' is, we will divide both sides of the equation by 5 (since 'c' is being multiplied by 5 on the right side). When we divide 50 by 5, we get 10. And then on the right side, when we divide 5*c by 5, we are left with just 'c', since 5 divided by 5 equals 1 and anything multiplied by 1 remains the same. Just like if you have one apple, it's still an apple, right? So, your final answer is c = 10.

Summarize this article: A HEARTBREAKING letter written by a dying young woman is going viral after she passed away last week. On the 4th of January Holly Butcher lost her battle with Ewing’s sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that affects mostly young people, at the age of 27. Before she died, the Grafton woman penned a letter which she asked her family to post on her Facebook account once she was gone. The message includes Holly’s moving insights as a 27-year-old woman forced to confront her mortality, despite not having done so many things she’d hoped and planned to do. “It’s a strange thing to realise and accept your mortality at 26 years young,” she reflected. “It’s just one of those things you ignore. The days tick by and you just expect they will keep on coming; until the unexpected happens. “That’s the thing about life,” she noted. “It is fragile, precious and unpredictable and each day is a gift, not a given right,” she said, adding “I’m 27 now. I don’t want to go.” After spending time reflecting on how she would live her life if she could overcome the disease, Holly decided to share her advice with those who get to keep on living. In just a few days it’s had almost 8,000 shares and more than 10,000 reactions. As a reminder to not sweat the small stuff, Holly assured you won’t be worrying about most of the things you complain about now when you’re on your death bed. “You might have got caught in bad traffic today, or had a bad sleep because your beautiful babies kept you awake, or your hairdresser cut your hair too short. Your new fake nails might have got a chip, your boobs are too small, or you have cellulite on your arse and your belly is wobbling. “Let all that s*** go,” she urged. “I swear you will not be thinking of those things when it is your turn to go. “I’m watching my body waste away right before my eyes with nothing I can do about it and all I wish for now is that I could have just one more birthday or Christmas with my family, or just one more day with my partner and dog. Just one more.” Holly wrote that we should be more mindful with money, and spend it on things that make other people happy rather than more stuff for ourselves. “It is a weird thing having money to spend at the end, when you’re dying. It’s not a time you go out and buy material things that you usually would, like a new dress. “It makes you think how silly it is that we think it is worth spending so much money on new clothes and ‘things’ in our lives,” she said. “Buy your friend something kind instead of another dress, beauty product or jewellery for that next wedding ... take them out for a meal, or better yet, cook them a meal. Shout their coffee. Give or buy them a plant, a massage or a candle and tell them you love them when you give it to them.” Lateness is something that irritates a lot of people, and Holly insightfully summed up why that is — because it shows disrespect for the other person and their time, which is limited. “Value other people’s time. Don’t keep them waiting because you are s*** at being on time. Get ready earlier if you are one of those people and appreciate that your friends want to share their time with you, not sit by themselves, waiting on a mate. You will gain respect too.” She also came to the realisation that documenting your life for social media dilutes the power of the moment while you’re actually living it. “Try just enjoying and being in moments rather than capturing them through the screen of your phone. Life isn’t meant to be lived through a screen nor is it about getting the perfect photo ... enjoy the bloody moment, people! Stop trying to capture it for everyone else.” Holly’s final point might be the most important. Receiving blood donations allowed her to live for an extra year, and she urged everyone to donate blood regularly. “Blood donation (more bags than I could keep up with counting) helped keep me alive for an extra year — a year I will be forever grateful that I got to spend here on earth with my family, friends and dog. A year I had some of the greatest times of my life.” Donate blood and save three lives — visit the Australian Red Cross Blood Service at www.donateblood.com.au for more information. ||||| A heartbreaking but inspiring letter from a dying Australian woman has gone viral after her death. Holly Butcher, 27, died from Ewing’s sarcoma and left behind a letter which she asked her family to post on her Facebook account after her death, according to News.com.au. Butcher wrote about enjoying life to the fullest and talked frankly about her mortality as well as the things she wished she had more time to do, like raise her own family. “It’s a strange thing to realise and accept your mortality at 26 years young,” she wrote. “It’s just one of those things you ignore. The days tick by and you just expect they will keep on coming; until the unexpected happens.” “That’s the thing about life,” she continued. “It is fragile, precious and unpredictable and each day is a gift, not a given right. I’m 27 now. I don’t want to go.” Holly Butcher Holly Butcher/Facebook Butcher explained she led a healthy life, but that her disease had left her to realize there were more important aspects of living a healthy lifestyle, such as being healthy emotionally and mentally. “Be grateful for each day you don’t have pain and even the days where you are unwell with man flu, a sore back or a sprained ankle, accept it is s— but be thankful it isn’t life threatening and will go away,” she wrote. “Whinge less, people! .. And help each other more.” She confessed it was “a weird thing having money to spend at the end.. when you’re dying. It’s not a time you go out and buy material things that you usually would, like a new dress. It makes you think how silly it is that we think it is worth spending so much money on new clothes and ‘things’ in our lives.” She offered a reminder to not spend time thinking about small issues, but to focus on experiencing moments with family and friends. Holly Butcher/Facebook “You might have got caught in bad traffic today, or had a bad sleep because your beautiful babies kept you awake, or your hairdresser cut your hair too short,” she wrote. “Your new fake nails might have got a chip, your boobs are too small, or you have cellulite on your arse and your belly is wobbling.” “Let all that s— go,” she urged. “I swear you will not be thinking of those things when it is your turn to go.” “I’m watching my body waste away right before my eyes with nothing I can do about it and all I wish for now is that I could have just one more birthday or Christmas with my family, or just one more day with my partner and dog. Just one more.” Butcher also encouraged readers to donate more blood, revealing that it extended her life by one year. “Oh and one last thing, if you can, do a good deed for humanity (and myself) and start regularly donating blood. It will make you feel good with the added bonus of saving lives,” she wrote. “I feel like it is something that is so overlooked considering every donation can save 3 lives! That is a massive impact each person can have and the process really is so simple.” She added, “Blood donation (more bags than I could keep up with counting) helped keep me alive for an extra year – a year I will be forever grateful that I got to spend it here on Earth with my family, friends and dog. A year I had some of the greatest times of my life.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"A heartfelt letter written by Holly Butcher, a 27-year-old Australian woman who recently passed away from a rare form of cancer called Ewing's sarcoma, has gone viral on social media.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Every pet owner loves his pet. There is no argument here. But when we asked our readers whether they would clone (, )their beloved animals, the responses were split almost down the middle. Of the 228 readers who answered it, 108 would clone, 111 would not and nine weighed each side without offering an opinion. Clearly, from readers' response, this is an issue that reaches deeply into both the joy and _ . It speaks, as well, to people's widely differing expectations over the developing scientific procedure. Most of the respondents who favored the idea strongly believed it would produce at least a close copy of the original; many felt the process would actually return an exact copy. Those on the other side, however, held little hope a clone could never truly recreate a pet, many simply didn't wish to go against the natural law of life and death. Both sides expressed equal love for their animals. More than a few respondents owned \\"the best dog/cat in the world\\". They thought of their pets as their \\"best friend\\", \\"a member of the family,\\"\\"the light of my life.\\" They told moving stories of pets' heroism, intelligence and selfless devotion. Then the loss is so disturbing---and the cloning so attractive. \\"People become very close to their animals, and the loss can be just as hard to bear as when a friend or family member dies,\\" says Gary Kowalski, author of Goodbye, Friend: Healing Wisdom for Anyone Who Has Ever Lost a Pet. \\"For me, cloning feels like an attempt to turn death away...It's understandable. Death is always painful. It's difficult to deal with. It's hard to accept.\\" But would cloning reduce the blow? This question seemed to be at the heart of this problem. Question: What is the key question at the heart of the problem of cloning pets? - Can cloning make the pain one suffers less when a pet dies? - Can pet owners afford the cost of cloning? - Does cloning go against the law of nature? - How reliably does cloning produce an exact copy of one's pet? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Can cloning make the pain one suffers less when a pet dies?\\" This is the key question at the heart of the debate regarding pet cloning as per the article. The piece presents multiple perspectives but centralizes the discussion around the emotional impact of losing a pet and whether cloning could potentially alleviate that pain. The affordability of cloning, the ethical implications, and the reliability of the process are other pertinent issues raised, but the article focalizes primarily on the emotional consequences and potential benefits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: antique sword for the following movie plot: The film begins with Detective Havenhurst driving with his partner Detective Vargas. They receive a call and drive to the scene of a murder. As they push their way through the crowd at the crime scene, they see Brad McCullam leaving with a coffee cup. Inside the house, the detectives find the body of Mrs. McCullam, Brad's mother, who has just been stabbed with an antique sword. At the scene are the neighbors and chief witnesses, Mrs. and Miss Roberts. The detectives soon realize that they had just seen the murderer leaving the scene. The Robertses tell the detectives that Brad was disturbed, and had changed when he went to Peru recently. In a flashback we see Brad in Peru preparing for a kayak trip on a raging river. Back to the present time, the police have learned that Brad has taken two hostages in the house across the street. The police surround the house, and Brad's fiancÃ©e Ingrid arrives. Ingrid talks to Havenhurst about Brad's trip to Peru, saying that Brad's friends all drowned on their kayak trip, which Brad had decided at the last minute not to take part in; he later claimed that the voice of God had told him to stay behind. Several more flashbacks follow of Brad and Ingrid in Brad's bedroom, talking with Mrs. McCullam, looking at nearby houses, having dinner. Back in the present, Brad demands pizza for himself and the hostages, along with a car for transportation to Mexico. In another flashback, we see Brad in rehearsals for a Greek tragedy directed by Lee Meyers. As the pizza is delivered to Brad, Lee arrives at the scene of the crime. Lee talks with Havenhurst about Brad, and we flash back to Lee and Brad visiting Uncle Ted's ostrich farm. Brad convinces Uncle Ted to give him the antique sword which would be used in the crime. Brad uses the sword in more rehearsals for the play, in which he plays the part of a man who kills his mother, who is played by his fiancÃ©e Ingrid. Brad becomes disruptive and is eventually kicked out of the production, but still travels to Calgary with Lee and his mother...

Peter Souleo Wright organized \\"The Button Show\\" at Rush Arts Gallery in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Eleven artists used the small, ordinary objects to create sculptures, portraits and wearable art. Some of the works are political, some are personal and others are just fun. Wright said each artist reimagines and repurposes the buttons to make art. \\"What I tried to do with this show,\\" he said , \\"was to look at artists who were promoting that level of craft.\\" He said he wanted the button art to be comparable to a painting \\"because of the amount of detail and precision in the work\\". Artist Beau McCall produced \\"A Harlem Hangover\\". It looks like a wine bottle that fell over on a table. A stream of connected red buttons hang over the side, like wine flowing down. Similar red buttons form a small pool on the floor. McCall layers buttons of different shapes and sizes to create the bottle. The stitching that holds them together is also part of the artistic design. For San Francisco-based artist Lisa Kokin, buttons are highly personal. After her father died in 2001, she created a portrait of him using only buttons. That memorial to her father led to other button portraits, including those of activists Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez. Others use buttons for details. Artist Amalia Amaki of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, placed them on and around old photographs. Los Angeles artist Camilla Taylor attached buttons to three large sculptures that look like headless animals with long , narrow legs. \\"The Button Show\\" ends at March 12.

Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead.

Read this: In 1887, the British Empire celebrated Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to \\"Munshi\\": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, \\"the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.\\" Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Yes, I have a few questions to further enhance my understanding: 1.

To do this, add 2 to both sides of the equation: -3*c - 2 + 2 = -5 + 2 Step 3: Simplify both sides: -3*c = -3 Step 4: Now, to solve for c, you want to eliminate the -3 coefficient in front of the variable c. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by -3: (-3*c) / (-3) = (-3) / (-3) Step 5: Simplify both sides: c = 1 So, the solution to the equation -3*c - 2 = -5 is c = 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The intention behind this solution may be to increase competition in the airline industry, allowing smaller, low-fare airlines to gain a foothold and offer consumers more diverse options. On the other hand, Sentence 2 proposes a solution that involves taking slots at airports away from small airlines, implying that these slots will be taken from small airlines and given to larger airlines or other entities.

Article: Some people in Manchester, Britain, will soon be paying for goods and services with so-called \\"smart\\" credit cards. These cards are more secure than the traditional magnetic-strip version and can be used to travel on buses, check bank accounts and do shopping. The Manchester project is one of the biggest smart card schemes in the world. Every time people use the cards on a bus or train, the fare is deducted (reduced) from the value of the card. When they have no credit left, the cards can be recharged at a local shop. A smart card looks just like a normal plastic card but it has a silicon chip in it. It is possible for the same silicon chip to perform a number of different functions, so one plastic card in your pocket could do a large number of different jobs. The card has much more memory space than a magnetic-strip card, so many more things can be recorded on it.There are two types of smart cards. One is the contact card which is used in the same way as a magnetic-strip card. Information is transferred by running the card through a narrow opening in an electronic reader. In the slot, electronic probes make contact with the magnetic-strip or silicon ship and read the information. The other type is the contactless smart card where the electronic reader communicates with the card by short-range radio waves. This makes the card quicker and more convenient to use because it does not have to leave your wallet. It is also more reliable as it is not easily influenced by scratches or dirt. However, the biggest advantage that smart cards have over magnetic-strip cards is that they are more secure. They are much more difficult to make than conventional cards and they have to be made by specially trained manufacturers. In addition, they have a large number of extra security features on them and if a smart card gets lost or stolen a quick phone-call to the distributor ensures that its individual number is made invalid and unreadable. This can be done more quickly than with a magnetic-strip card. Question: \\" The cards can be recharged\\" means that _ . Options: A: the card can be put into a new charge of electricity B: the cards can be changed into new ones C: the cards can be put to use again D: the cards can be recycled Answer:","completion":"C: the cards can be put to use again"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let it simmer for 30 minutes in enough water to cover the strips. Strain the juice through a colander and store it in another pot. Let it cool. Explain that the red cabbage juice is called an “indicator.” This means that it will help you figure out if a substance is an acid or a base. Take some of the juice and pour it into several clear cups. Put the rest to the side for now. It doesn't matter how much you pour in each cup. A few ounces will be fine, and should leave you enough experiment with several substances. Use as many cups as you have substances to test. For instance, if you want to test milk, tomato juice, and soy sauce, use three cups. Take a spoonful of baking soda and pour it into one of the glasses. Have a kid stir until the soda begins to dissolve. The solution will turn from red to blue or purplish. Explain the indicator solution changes this color because baking soda is a base. Take some ordinary white vinegar and pour it into the same glass as the baking soda. Ask a kid to stir the solution. It will turn red again before your eyes! Explain this is because the acidic vinegar changes the pH of the solution by neutralizing the base (baking soda). Practice stirring different substances into cups of the solution. Drinks like cola, lemon juice, or milk work well. Before you try each substance, ask the kids if they think the solution will turn bluish (meaning it’s a base) or a deeper red (meaning it’s an acid). To help the kids decide, ask them to think about whether or not the substance tastes sour (acid) or bitter (base). Summary:","completion":"This article provides a detailed explanation of an experiment that can be conducted to help understand acids and bases using red cabbage juice as an indicator. The author begins by guiding the reader through the process of making red cabbage juice indicator from a head of red cabbage, as the juice changes color when mixed with substances depending on their acidity or basicity. The experiment involves pouring the cabbage juice into several clear cups to test various substances like milk, tomato juice, soy sauce, baking soda, and ordinary white vinegar, depending on the number of substances one wishes to test. The author demonstrates the experiment using baking soda, which when mixed with the red cabbage juice, turns from red to blue or purplish, indicating that baking soda is a base. By adding white vinegar to the same glass and stirring, the solution turns red again, signifying that the acidic vinegar has neutralized the base (baking soda). The experiment can be extended to other substances like cola, lemon juice, or milk. Before adding each substance, children can be asked to guess if the solution will turn bluish (for a base) or deeper red (for an acid), based on whether the substance tastes sour (acid) or bitter (base).

Information: - Outlaw country is a subgenre of American country music, most popular during the 1970s and early-1980s, sometimes referred to as the outlaw movement or simply outlaw music. The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like honky tonk and rockabilly and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and popular structures of the Nashville sound developed by record producers like Chet Atkins. - The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music, replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with \\"smooth strings and choruses\\", \\"sophisticated background vocals\\" and \\"smooth tempos\\". It was an attempt \\"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock 'n' roll.\\" - Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album \\"Shotgun Willie\\" (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" (1975) and \\"Stardust\\" (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana. - Shotgun Willie is a 1973 album by Willie Nelson. The recording marks a change of style for Nelson, who later stated that the album \\"cleared his throat\\". When Nelson refused to sign an early extension of his contract with RCA in 1972, the label decided not to release any further recordings. Nelson hired Neil Reshen as his manager, and while Reshen negotiated with RCA, Nelson moved to Austin, Texas, where the ongoing hippie music scene at the Armadillo World Headquarters renewed his musical style. In Nashville, Nelson met producer Jerry Wexler, vice president of Atlantic Records, who was interested in his music. Reshen solved the problems with RCA and signed Nelson with Atlantic Records as their first country music artist. - Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson. After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the \\"Tale of the Red Headed Stranger\\", a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added. - Island in the Sea is a 1987 album by country singer Willie Nelson . Its title track was a minor hit . The album also includes the song \`\` Nobody There But Me '' , featuring Bruce Hornsby and the Range , released as the second single .

Added a comma after \\"me\\" – This is done to set off the parenthetical expression \\"since I am in San Francisco\\" and to indicate a brief pause in the sentence. A parenthetical expression provides additional information in a sentence but is not essential to the meaning of the sentence. Commas are used to separate these expressions from the rest of the sentence. 2. Added a comma after \\"Francisco\\" – This comma is used to separate the parenthetical expression \\"since I am in San Francisco\\" from the main part of the sentence. Just like the first comma, this one indicates a brief pause and sets off the expression. 3. Capitalized the \\"t\\" in \\"The\\" – This corrects a minor capitalization error. The word \\"the\\" should not be capitalized within a sentence unless it is part of a proper noun or it is the first word in the sentence. 4.

During this step, a person inhales air through the mouth or nose, and it enters the respiratory system. This is the crucial starting point that sets off the entire chain of events required to deliver oxygen to the body's tissues and cells. Here is the complete process, including the missing step: 1. Inhalation or breathing in: Air is drawn into the mouth or nose, initiating the respiratory process. 2. Air is transported to the lungs: The inhaled air passes through the trachea and bronchi, reaching the lungs. 3. Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs: The air continues to move through the finer branches of the bronchi, called bronchioles, and finally reaches the tiny alveoli. 4. In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries: The walls of the alveoli are extremely thin, allowing oxygen to diffuse across them and enter the bloodstream. 5. The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood: This facilitates the transfer of oxygen from the alveoli to the bloodstream. 6. The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells: Hemoglobin in red blood cells binds to the oxygen molecules. 7. The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme: This is a crucial part of the transport process. 8. Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach various tissues: Oxygenated blood is pumped by the heart and travels through the circulatory system. 9. Within small capillaries, the heme releases the oxygen: This delivers it to the surrounding tissues. 10. The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue: This enables cells to use this vital element for energy production and other essential cellular processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. HuffPost Illustration/Reuters Alex Jones may soon learn that maligning the parents of dead children comes with serious consequences. Alex Jones has spent years claiming the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School ― where a shooter killed 20 small children and six adults ― was faked. He has claimed the parents of these dead children are liars and “crisis actors.” Now, those parents are coming after him. In a pair of lawsuits filed late Monday, the parents of two children who died in the December 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, say Jones’ repeated lies and conspiratorial ravings have led to death threats. The suits join at least two other recent cases accusing the Infowars host of defamation. I lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with a bullet hole through his head. Neil Heslin, father of a 6-year-old boy killed during the Sandy Hook shooting. Neil Heslin, the father of a 6-year-old boy killed in the shooting, and Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, who lost their own little boy, filed the suits in Austin, Texas, where Jones’ conspiracy-minded media outlet is based. Each suit is seeking more than 1 million in damages from Jones, Infowars and a related company, Free Speech Systems LLC. Infowars reporter Owen Shroyer is also named in one of the suits. “Even after these folks had to experience this trauma, for the next five years they were tormented by Alex Jones with vicious lies about them,” Mark Bankston, the lawyer handling the cases for the parents, told HuffPost. “And these lies were meant to convince his audience that the Sandy Hook parents are frauds and have perpetrated a sinister lie on the American people.” Bankston, of the Houston law firm Farrar & Ball, is also involved in another defamation suit against Jones, representing a man whom Infowars incorrectly identified as the Parkland, Florida, school shooter. Infowars, Jones and Shroyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Heslin’s suit focuses on what it calls a “heartless and vile” claim of Shroyer’s: that the father lied in an interview with NBC News’ Megyn Kelly about holding his dead son’s body. “I lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with a bullet hole through his head,” Heslin told Kelly in the June 2017 segment profiling Jones. Alex Wong via Getty Images Neil Heslin testifies during a Senate hearing on assault weapons in February 2013. Days after the segment aired, Shroyer told Infowars viewers that Heslin could not have held his son because victims were identified through photographs, not in person. “That’s not something you would just misspeak on,” Shroyer said during the June 26, 2017, broadcast, which Jones himself plugged a month later. But that claim is “manifestly false,” Heslin’s suit says: The children’s bodies were eventually turned over to their parents for their funerals. In the other suit filed Tuesday, Pozner and De La Rosa ― whose son was the youngest victim in the shooting ― are also targeting Jones for calling them liars. During an April 2017 broadcast on Infowars, Jones discussed an interview De La Rosa gave to CNN’s Anderson Cooper shortly after the tragedy, and claimed the entire thing was faked. “So here are these holier than thou people, when we question CNN, who is supposedly at the site of Sandy Hook, and they got in one shot leaves blowing, and the flowers that are around it, and you see the leaves blowing, and they go [gestures]. They glitch,” Jones said, according to a transcript quoted in the lawsuit. “They’re recycling a green-screen behind them.” Anyone ... who spends 15 minutes talking to one of these parents will understand immediately how vile this lie was. Mark Bankston, lawyer for the Sandy Hook parents suing Jones. This was a lie Jones has been repeating for years. “Folks, we’ve got video of Anderson Cooper with clear blue-screen out there,” Jones said in 2014. “He’s not there in the town square. We got people clearly coming up and laughing and then doing the fake crying. We’ve clearly got people where it’s actors playing different parts for different people, the building bulldozed, covering up everything.” It’s been five years since the shooting, the lawsuit says, and “Mr. Jones continues to push this sick lie about Mrs. De La Rosa and her interview.” Infowars’ practice of disseminating outright lies has led to serious consequences for the families of the Sandy Hook victims, the lawsuit says. In June 2017, Florida woman Lucy Richards, then 57, was sentenced to five months in prison for sending threats to Pozner. “You gonna die,” Richards told Pozner in one recorded voicemail message. “Death is coming to you real soon.” As part of her sentence, Richards will no longer be allowed to access Infowars, according to the lawsuit. As of Tuesday morning, Infowars still had blatantly false stories posted on its website claiming the mass shooting was a hoax. “FBI SAYS NO ONE KILLED AT SANDY HOOK,” screams one headline. Mike Segar / Reuters A memorial for the Sandy Hook victims, shown days after the December 2012 shooting. Bankston told HuffPost he has never before seen cases involving the kind of “mental anguish” these parents are experiencing. “I think as a father, it’s a very surreal experience,” Bankston said. “Anyone, parents or not, who spends 15 minutes talking to one of these parents will understand immediately how vile this lie was, and how genuine their pain is.” The defamation lawsuits could have devastating consequences for Jones and Infowars, especially because these are not the only ones against him. In March, the man who recorded the deadly car attack at last year’s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, sued Jones for calling him a “deep state shill” and a “CIA asset” who helped organize the attack ― he’s not, and he didn’t. And then there’s the lawsuit Bankston filed earlier this month. He’s suing on behalf of the 24-year-old man whom Infowars falsely identified as the gunman who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February. For the Sandy Hook parents, they just want the lies to stop. Even when Jones made an assurance he’d stop talking about it, that too was a lie. During a November 2016 broadcast, Jones said that if “children were lost at Sandy Hook, my heart goes out to each and every one of those parents.” But he didn’t stop there: “The only problem is, I’ve watched a lot of soap operas, and I’ve seen actors before. And I know when I’m watching a movie and when I’m watching something real.” The broadcast was titled “Alex Jones Final Statement on Sandy Hook.” ||||| Three parents whose children were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 filed a defamation lawsuit on Tuesday against Alex Jones, the right-wing conspiracy theorist who has long claimed the shooting was “completely fake” and a “giant hoax” perpetrated by opponents of the Second Amendment. Mr. Jones, the popular radio show host who also operates the conspiracy theory website Infowars, has questioned for years whether 20 children and six adults died in the school massacre in Newtown, Conn. To bolster his false claims, he often cites news reports and video clips from the hours after the shooting that turned out to be incomplete or based on wrong information. Soon after they buried their children, many Sandy Hook parents started to come under fierce attack by conspiracy theorists who have said they are actors in an elaborate scheme to enact stricter gun control laws. The fringe theories still thrive in small forums online but have reached a far greater audience through Mr. Jones, the most vocal propagator. The two lawsuits filed on Tuesday represent the first civil action taken by parents accusing Mr. Jones of defamation. One was filed by Leonard Pozner and his former wife, Veronique De La Rosa, and the other was filed by Neil Heslin. Their sons, Noah Pozner and Jesse Heslin, both 6, were killed at Sandy Hook. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist who claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was fake, is being sued by the parents of two children who died in the tragedy.

Article: The low sitting bridge will divide the long vertical line of your nose more evenly, so the bottom portion of your nose--the portion that the eye naturally catches--will seem smaller. A wide bridge creates a stronger, more visible divide. Larger frames are generally a better option than smaller ones. The large frames can compete with the size of your nose and help balance it out, but smaller frames can draw more attention to the size of your nose. The other option is to go for contacts. Since glasses sit at the top of your nose, they do draw some attention to that area of your face. Getting contacts avoids this issue completely. Your ears and nose share the same horizontal space on your face. Short, dainty earrings can draw attention to this horizontal space, which could also draw attention to your nose. Larger earrings that extend below the ear enlarge the sides of this horizontal space, making the nose at the center of this space appear smaller by comparison. If you do not want to wear long earrings, at least choose short earrings that cover the earlobes completely. This will draw more attention to the sides of this horizontal space, which can help draw attention off your nose. Rounded earrings that occupy both horizontal and vertical space are better than earrings that only add a vertical dimension. Earrings that emphasize straight, vertical lines will also emphasize the straight, vertical line of the nose. Both men and women should look for hat styles that have a rounded or down-turned brim at the front of the face. A brim that hangs down over the front of the face can visually build out the forehead. As a result, the nose appears shorter and more proportionate. Avoid \\"tricorne\\" styles, which meet at a point above the forehead. Hats that have a larger brim in the front than in the back may build out the forehead better than those with an even brim all around. Make sure that the crown does not pinch in too tightly toward the front of the face. Ideally, this crown should also be of medium height to maintain better visual balance, and it should not taper in much toward the top. Consider choosing a hat with a wide, colorful band above the brim. This band can draw the eye up and away from the nose.

A 'lorry load' of evidence relating to an investigation into alleged police corruption over the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry was systematically shredded over two days, it was reported today. THE mass shredding of files from a major Scotland Yard corruption inquiry was yesterday branded ‘an out and out disgrace’ by a murder victim’s brother. Alastair Morgan, whose private eye brother Daniel was killed by an axeman in a plot allegedly involving police officers, hit out following reports that a ‘lorry load’ of documents from a top-secret corruption probe had been destroyed over two days. The latest revelations deepened the Metropolitan Police ‘shredding scandal’ and prompted new claims of a cover-up at the force. The large-scale destruction of corruption files was a key finding of a review of the Stephen Lawrence case, published earlier this month, which suggested possible links between an allegedly corrupt officer involved in the Lawrence case – former Detective Sergeant John Davidson – and the investigation into the Morgan murder. Married father-of-two Daniel Morgan, 37, was found with an axe in his head in a south-east London pub car park in 1987. His murder remains unsolved, despite five investigations. An independent judge-led panel of experts is now reviewing the police handling of the murder, amid claims corrupt officers prevented convictions. Mr Morgan’s family say he was on the verge of exposing police corruption when he was killed. His brother Alastair added: ‘We need a supervised outside investigation into the shredding of the Met’s corruption files. 'This is not a mistake.’ Inquiry: The Bishop of Stepney, Sir William MacPherson, Tom Cook and Dr. Richard Stone - at the preliminary hearing of the Stephen Lawrence public inquiry in 1997. Following publication earlier this. month of the review by Mark Ellison QC, it is now feared corrupt. officers who thwarted justice in the Morgan case could also have. shielded those who murdered Stephen in a racist attack in Eltham,. south-east London, in 1993. Buried. in the review is a reference to a police intelligence report, dated. April 28, 2004, concerning Operation Abelard, the investigation into. Daniel Morgan’s murder. The report had ‘specific emphasis’ on Davidson, and stated that he was attached to the initial Morgan investigation in 1987. It. said: ‘DS Davidson has been investigated by this command. (Anti-Corruption Command) in the past and is known to associate with. some of the subjects of not only Operation Abelard but also several. other Directorate of Professional Standards investigations.’ Mr. Ellison’s report found evidence to suspect that Davidson had acted. corruptly in the Lawrence case, and that material had been withheld from. the subsequent 1998 Macpherson Inquiry into the police’s handling of. the black teenager’s murder. The. material that was shredded in 2003 was from a wider, top-secret. investigation into possible police corruption that began in 1993 and. came to be known as Operation Othona. The. Ellison report said it needed to see the Othona files to investigate. possible links with the Lawrence case, and to establish what was known. about police corruption at the time of the Macpherson Inquiry. The latest revelations deepened the Scotland Yard's ¿shredding scandal¿ and prompted new claims of a cover-up at the force. It. is alleged that when Stephen was murdered, Davidson was having a. corrupt relationship with Clifford Norris, the gangster father of one of. his killers, David Norris. The ex-detective denies this. Some. computer files relating to the Othona operation were found on a hard. drive in a cardboard box in the Met Police’s professional standards. department in November 2013. But. paper copies of the intelligence were missing. The Ellison review was. told there had been a ‘mass shredding’ of them in 2003. One source told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there had been a ‘lorry load’ of documents, photographs and videos. In. a message on Twitter yesterday, Alastair Morgan made clear he does not. accept an innocent explanation for the mass shredding. He. told senior officers: ‘Don’t take the public for fools gentlemen. The. shredding of the Othona files is an out and out disgrace.’ Yesterday. Davidson, 65, said: ‘I am not corrupt. I would like to speak but I. can’t basically. I am paying a lot of money to my solicitor and he’s. told me to talk to nobody. That includes the Press.’ Scotland. Yard said: ‘The Met was informed by a former employee on February 4,. 2014 that in 2003, two staff were tasked to shred a quantity of. documents that related to corruption inquiries. The information supplied by the witness was scant but the Met felt it necessary to pass it on to Mr Ellison’s review. ‘Met. officers now intend to meet the witness to clarify their account. At. this time the Met has little detail on the circumstances that led to the. shredding.’ Highlights:","completion":"1.

Write a title for this article: Washington (CNN) -- For Joe Biden, an evenly divided Senate would be a BFD. If Tuesday's midterm elections result in a Senate split, the vice president will suddenly find himself in one of his favorite places: the spotlight. Biden would become a crucial player in the Senate, providing the tie-breaking vote on key bills and keeping the chamber in Democratic hands for the twilight years of President Barack Obama's administration. For a politician who spent 36 years in the Senate and has run into trouble conforming to the constraints of being Obama's No. 2, a divide could be a welcome twist to a career that has often confounded expectations. \\"Clearly, he is a creature of the Senate,\\" said Ted Kaufman, Biden's former chief of staff who filled in as Delaware senator when his boss became vice president. \\"I can't think of a better person to be in that position. I know he would relish it.\\" It's rare for an election to result in an even split in the 100-seat Senate, turning control over to the vice president's party. The last time that happened was after the 2000 election, when Dick Cheney's role as a tiebreaker solidified a GOP majority. That only continued for a few months before a moderate Republican switched parties and gave Democrats full control of the Senate. READ: Six times Biden aimed for the truth and caused a headache This year, the GOP needs to post a net gain of six seats to control the chamber and Republicans appear to be on track to do that. But their efforts are being muddied by the enduring strength of Democratic candidates in Kentucky and Georgia, who are within striking distance of claiming Republican seats -- raising the potential of a split Senate. And even if one party wins a slim majority, Biden could find himself on standby for much of the next two years. Deaths or absences among members -- and the possibility that several independents could switch parties and scramble the Senate's partisan math -- will raise the odds that Biden may be called upon. Biden's role would mostly be limited to casting tie-breaking votes -- not delving into the nitty gritty of legislating. And, of course, tie-breaking votes might be rare in a Senate where most bills now require 60 votes to proceed. But any additional time in the Senate would play to Biden's strengths. Few men in history have adored the clubby chamber as much as Biden and he relishes opportunities to cut deals. \\"The United States Senate has been my life — and that is not hyperbole,\\" Biden said in his farewell address, summing up a career of melodramatic confirmation hearings, personal tragedy, health scares and failed presidential campaigns. \\"It literally has been my life.\\" Given his affinity for the Senate, it must gall Biden that he is among only 12 of 47 vice presidents not to have cast one of the 244 tie breaking votes, according to Senate historians. Still, as vice president, he has played a crucial role in getting the administration and Senate Republicans out of jams, orchestrating agreements to raise the debt ceiling and avert the fiscal cliff. An expanded role in the Senate could also come in handy for Biden if he decides to launch a long-shot bid for the White House in 2016. Of course, there are potential downsides. If he decides to run for president, he could be forced to take uncomfortable votes that wouldn't play well on the campaign trail. And a larger gig in the Senate could only provide another venue for his legendary slip-ups, which provide endless fodder for the media and plenty of headaches for the White House. He has been on a roll lately — recently apologizing to key Middle Eastern allies for blaming them for the rise of ISIS. READ: Biden apologizes to Turkey, UAE In October, Biden quipped that the vice presidency was a \\"b—ch of a job, weeks after angering Jewish groups by using the term \\"Shylocks\\" and calling Asia the \\"Orient.\\" Once, in Delaware, he joked you couldn't go to a 7-Eleven unless you had a \\"slight Indian accent.\\" In a private meeting with black clergy in South Carolina, Biden referred to himself as \\"the only white boy on the east side of Wilmington\\" as he recalled his days as a Delaware public defender. Touring global hot spots on Air Force Two, Biden sometimes baffles foreign leaders with his break-the-ice line : \\"if I had hair like yours I'd be president by now.\\" He chatted up grandmas at a Senate swearing in ceremony and told Heidi Heitkamp's family to \\"spread your legs, you're gonna be frisked.\\" And in his most famous faux pas, Biden was caught at the White House on a hot mic telling Obama that passing health care reform was a \\"big f——g deal. Biden's tongue has sometimes irked the West Wing. In 2012, for instance, he trashed Obama's plans to roll out his backing for gay marriage by committing the cardinal vice presidential sin on \\"Meet the Press\\" of getting ahead of the boss. But White House insiders say Obama values Biden's loyalty and owes him one for steadying the re-election campaign after his own first disastrous debate with Mitt Romney. Vice presidential scholar Joel Goldstein said Biden's influence can be measured in how often Obama reaches into his inner circle for staffers, notably Tom Donilon, Jay Carney and new Ebola czar Ron Klain. \\"On the one hand, people have this perception of him as an undisciplined guy because he says things that are viewed as gaffes. But on the other hand to have functioned in the way that he has shows a tremendous amount of discipline.\\" Biden has been in on every big national security decision, masterminded the withdrawal from Iraq, been a skeptic on military force, managed stimulus spending and gets hours of face time with the president. He has grabbed important national security portfolios including China and mentoring Ukraine's new government. But former secretary of defense Robert Gates wrote that though it was impossible not to like Biden, he had been \\"wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.\\" Despite his outsized persona, Biden would likely be welcomed back to the Senate warmly even with his eccentricities, according to veteran journalist Jules Witcover, who wrote the vice president's biography.

Here is a goal: How to I prepare my tools to make whipped cream? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Options are: (a). When making whipped cream, chill your whisk and your mixing bowl so the cream doesn't melt. (b). When making whipped cream, warm up your whisk and your mixing bowl so the cream doesn't melt.","completion":"The ideal way to accomplish this goal is by following option (a). When making whipped cream, it is recommended to chill your whisk and your mixing bowl so the cream doesn't melt. Justification: Whipped cream is made by incorporating air into cream with a fat content of at least 30%. Chilling the cream helps keep the fat solid which in turn helps keep the air bubbles intact. Thus, the colder the tools and cream are, the better they'll produce firm, longer-lasting whipped cream. Here is how you can prepare your tools for making whipped cream: 1. Choose a large mixing bowl and a whisk. 2. To chill the bowl and the whisk: Place them in the refrigerator (not the freezer) for at least 20-30 minutes before you plan to make the whipped cream. 3. Ensure the cream is also chilled because as mentioned before, cold cream whips up better. 4. After chilling, you can remove the tools from the fridge when you're ready to make the whipped cream. On the other hand, warming up your whisk and mixing bowl (option b) is not recommended because it can cause the cream to get too warm, which could prevent the fat from trapping the air bubbles effectively, leading to a less voluminous and less stable whipped cream."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Morse, elevated to fame and fortune by his invention of the telegraph, styled himself “an American who knows no North nor South nor East nor West, but who feels that everyone within the United States is his fellow countryman.” Lean, restless and pulsating with energy, the “Lightning Man” cherished the Union. Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded. Yet the acute phase of North-South sectionalism coincided with the arrival of the telegraph, which rocketed information ahead at speeds that seemed miraculous. Was this merely a coincidence? Or could the telegraph somehow have made Americans more distrustful of one another, and placed the country on the high road toward civil war? War between the United States and Mexico created the angry irritant that ultimately tore the Union apart — the question of slavery in the territories. An enormous region was about to come under America control — all of today’s California, Nevada and Utah, most of Arizona, plus parts of three other future states. Free soil advocates demanded that any lands seized from Mexico be declared off limits to slavery. But many white Southerners insisted they should have the right to take slaves wherever they pleased. In 1846 and 1847, as fighting took place in Mexico, a war of words raged in Washington — and it did not cease when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended military hostilities in early 1848. Although the climate of the newly acquired southwest was too arid for plantation slavery, nothing could still the contest between those who would prohibit it there and those who would protect it. One observer noted astutely that the two factions each wielded one side of “a pair of shears, neither of which could cut until joined together.” But with each side pulling its blade, the shears threatened to sever the Union. Abraham Lincoln’s election as president in November 1860 ultimately brought matters to a head. He and the Republican Party were pledged to prevent slavery’s further expansion. And many white Southerners considered that an intolerable affront. Notwithstanding his New England origins, Morse was well-disposed toward white Southerners. In his earlier career as a painter, he had traveled South to do commissioned portraits. He found no fault there. He regarded slavery as a benefit to everyone involved — it allowed “a weak and degraded race” to labor productively, protected and guided by Christian masters. And he held abolitionists in particular contempt — “a more wretched, disgusting, hypocritical crew, have not appeared on the face of the earth since the times of Robespierre.” Morse’s telegraph, first successfully demonstrated in May 1844, became a booming business during the next four years. By the summer of 1846, just as American forces headed south into Mexico, the poles and wires were in place to inaugurate the first telegraphic connection between New York and Washington. Almost immediately afterwards, the line between New York and Boston opened. By September, New York was linked to Buffalo and soon to points west. Work then began on a Southern line from Washington to New Orleans, via Richmond, Charleston and Mobile. By 1848, when the Mexican War concluded, the telegraph linked North and South more closely than ever before. Telegraphy transformed journalism. Newspaper publishers quickly grasped the new technology’s potential. The magical words “By Magnetic Telegraph” alerted readers to events that had just taken place hundreds of miles away. Steam-powered rotary presses — another new invention — enabled publishers to rapidly print newspapers in great quantities, and with far lower per unit costs. So mid-century Americans bought and read more newspapers than any other people on the face of the earth. The telegraph and newspapers combined to exert a uniquely powerful influence on American culture. No other part of the world was so affected. By 1860, there were 50,000 miles of telegraph in the United States, all built during the previous 16 years. Some 3,725 American newspapers were published daily or weekly. Fewer than 200 million newspaper copies were printed in 1840, but almost 900 million in 1860. New York City became the nerve center of American journalism — led by the New York Herald, the New York Tribune and the New York Times, founded in 1851. Even in many small and medium-sized localities, rival newspapers, each typically with a strongly partisan orientation, took hold. These startling advances in communications were closely tied to huge improvements in overland transport. Railroads — yet another new technology — vaulted forward in the late 1840s and 1850s. Railroad mileage jumped from fewer than 3,000 miles in 1840, mostly in the East, to over 36,000 miles that stretched West and South by 1860, across all settled parts of the Union. Bigger, faster, more powerful trains sped both passengers and freight to their destinations. The telegraph proved to be an essential mechanism for coordinating these far-flung operations. “Antebellum futurologists” expected that improved communications and transport would knit the Union together. They anticipated that Americans would become “more and more one people, thinking and acting alike,” writes Samuel F. B. Morse’s biographer, Kenneth Silverman. Prominent among the optimists was Morse himself. His famous motto — “What hath God wrought!” — fused personal success with national greatness. Instead, of course, national unity unraveled as antagonistic North-South stereotypes hardened during the 1850s. The dominant modern narrative of mid-19th century American history suggests that North and South began to see each other more clearly — and that each discovered how genuinely different the other had become. While a fast-changing North embraced progress and improvement, the South remained wedded to an archaic, retrogressive labor system. Under the circumstances, Northern and Southern outlooks and values necessarily diverged. There are powerful reasons why this image of a modern North and a static South is attractive — it so neatly seems to explain the bloodbath that soon followed. It says that two incompatible regions could not peacefully remain together. And the stereotypes at first glance make sense — nobody could mistake Massachusetts for Mississippi. Explore multimedia from the series and navigate through past posts, as well as photos and articles from the Times archive. But there were other reasons why each section viewed its counterpart in such a harsh light. Partisan managers during the 1850s had motive to play up North-South differences. Republicans warned that a “slave power conspiracy” stood poised to rob free white Northerners of access to the fertile West, while Southern Democrats depicted Republicans as dangerous radicals whose success would lead to a violent abolitionist invasion of the slave states. As Elizabeth Varon recently wrote here, North-South acrimony also included deliberately offensive gendered insults — its Northern critics saw a white South filled with lustful sadists, whereas some Southerners satirized Northern men as effeminate weaklings. By any reasonable standard, all of these images were overblown. And they especially distorted the border regions — the Upper South and the Lower North. Southern Illinois and Indiana actually had much in common with Kentucky and Missouri. And few whites living in the Upper South wanted their states to become more like the Deep South. New communications technologies must have played a key role in transforming exaggerated stereotypes into compelling realities, and persuading Northerners and Southerners that they were more different from each other than they actually were. “It was surely no accident,” Edward L. Ayers has written, “that a long-brewing sectional animosity boiled over when railroads, telegraphs, and newspapers proliferated in the 1840s and 1850s.” Both North and South, “rival editors wrenched the most inflammatory words out of context, underlining their danger, amplifying their threat.” The “frantic rush in every direction” that accompanied new railroads sharpened anxieties about the future of the territories. Even though North and South “shared a great deal,” part of what they shared was popular politics and a print media that depicted the opposite section in sinister terms. The possibility just sketched here — that his brainchild may somehow have fueled the fire — is one that Samuel F. B. Morse could not have accepted. Horrified by the course of events in early 1861 as the Union fractured and war threatened, he and some friends organized an “American Society for Promoting National Unity.” But it was too little and too late. The “Lightning Man” may have unleashed forces that neither he nor anyone else could control. Follow Disunion at twitter.com/NYTcivilwar or join us on Facebook.

Pick your answer from: + None of the above choices . + He was tired and wanted to go to bed . + He wanted peace and quiet . + He disliked the narrator 's singing .","completion":"Based on the context provided in the text, it appears that the most likely reason the child cut the lullaby short is because he was tired and wanted to go to bed. In the given passage, the narrator shares an anecdote about a child who enjoys listening to songs with echoed words, such as in the Bob Marley classic \\"Three Little Birds.\\" It is mentioned that the child finds this repetition endearing. However, on this particular night, the child only allows the narrator to sing the lullaby \\"Hi Lili\\" once before requesting to go to bed. This behavior of cutting lullaby time short is noted to have occurred for the second time. Given the available answer choices, the most plausible explanation for why the child cut short lullaby time is that he was tired and wanted to go to bed. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the child specifically asks to go to bed, suggesting that he is ready to sleep rather than desiring peace and quiet or disliking the narrator's singing. Additionally, the child is depicted as being fond of songs with echoed words, which intimates a generally appreciative attitude toward music rather than a distaste for the narrator's vocal performance. In summary, the most likely reason the child cut the lullaby short is that he was tired and wanted to go to bed, as he specifically asked for it and had previously shown an affinity for songs with echoed words. This interpretation aligns with the text's details and the child's demonstrated preferences, ruling out the other answer choices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer based on context: In April 1758, the British concluded the Anglo-Prussian Convention with Frederick in which they committed to pay him an annual subsidy of £670,000. Britain also dispatched 9,000 troops to reinforce Ferdinand's Hanoverian army, the first British troop commitment on the continent and a reversal in the policy of Pitt. Ferdinand had succeeded in driving the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of Emden in March 1758 before crossing the Rhine with his own forces, which caused alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand's victory over the French at the Battle of Krefeld and the brief occupation of Düsseldorf, he was compelled by the successful manoeuvering of larger French forces to withdraw across the Rhine. By this point Frederick was increasingly concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder in Brandenburg-Neumark, at the Battle of Zorndorf , a Prussian army of 35,000 men under Frederick on 25 August 1758, fought a Russian army of 43,000 commanded by Count William Fermor. Both sides suffered heavy casualties - the Prussians 12,800, the Russians 18,000 - but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. The American historian Daniel Marston described Zorndorf as a \\"draw\\" as both sides were too exhausted and had taken such losses that neither wished to fight another battle with the other.

Please remove spaces between words.","completion":"January2,1976,was theopening oftheinvestigationoftheSanctityoftheVirtues. The opening of the investigation of the Sanctity of the Virtues on January 2, 1976, marked an important milestone in the course of the Catholic Church's recognition of individuals who displayed exemplary lives of holiness and dedication to their faith. The process of recognizing a person as a saint is a thorough and meticulous one, and it involves several stages. The Sanctity of the Virtues investigation is the initial part of the canonization process, examining whether the candidate in question had practiced the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity in a heroic manner, as well as the cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, temperance, and fortitude. In a broader sense, the virtues refer to the positive moral qualities that guide an individual's actions and decisions. The careful analysis of these virtues in a person's life is necessary because it helps ascertain if the person led a life of profound holiness and could potentially serve as a moral example and role model to others. The cause for canonization, which includes the Sanctity of the Virtues, comprises a series of steps that start with the initiation of the investigation at the local level. The bishop, as the ecclesiastical authority, is responsible for gathering information about the proposed candidate, which includes testimonies, written accounts of their life, and other relevant documents. Once the documents are compiled and organized, they form the \\"positio,\\" a comprehensive summary of the cause. Upon completion of the local procedures, the cause is then forwarded to the Vatican, specifically to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. A team of theologians, historians, and other experts thoroughly analyze the positio, evaluating not only the sanctity of the life of the person in question but also the presence of any miracles attributed to their intersession following their death. After confirming the sanctity of the virtues and the presence of approved miracles, the Pope may proclaim the candidate to be a Blessed, and eventually, with additional miracles, canonize them as a Saint. The whole process can take many years or even centuries, and some causes are known to have lasted for an extended period before reaching a successful conclusion. In summary, the investigation of the Sanctity of the Virtues on January 2, 1976, proved significant in the ecclesiastical journey of recognizing a person's holiness and dedication to their faith. This process is a crucial part of the Catholic Church's careful and time-consuming efforts to identify individuals who can serve as moral examples for the broader Christian community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was fun, loving, kind, great with me, everything she had been looking for. They dated for.. a few months I think? Maybe a year. Then they got married and we moved to Texas. They were married for 5 years and she was just as miserable those 5 years. He was mean, he lied about everything, he was addicted to porn and stole from his job. He was controlling and wouldn’t let anyone else handle money. It was a rough house to grow up in and hard on my mom as she tried to keep me from the abuse. Eventually he cheated on her with one of her best friends and she kicked him out. I didn’t even notice he was gone for a week because he was so absent in my life. He apologized, turned into the man she first met and they tried again. He again cheated on her and she left him again, that time for good. They ended up finalizing the divorce a year later. I remember her telling me that she confronted him about his change of character and he had told her “Everyone puts on an act at first.” As if it was a normal thing. He had depression and I believe he wanted everyone to be just as miserable as he was.

Background: Sebastian Newbold Coe, Baron Coe, (born 29 September 1956), often referred to as Seb Coe or Lord Coe, is a British politician and former track and field athlete. As a middle-distance runner, Coe won four Olympic medals, including the 1500 metres gold medal at the Olympic Games in 1980 and 1984. He set eight outdoor and three indoor world records in middle-distance track events - including, in 1979, setting three world records in the space of 41 days - and the world record he set in the 800 metres in 1981 remained unbroken until 1997. Coe's rivalries with fellow Britons Steve Ovett and Steve Cram dominated middle-distance racing for much of the 1980s. Context: When London announced its bid to hold the 2012 Olympics, Coe became an ambassador for the effort and a member of the board of the bid company. With the May 2004 resignation of chairman Barbara Cassani, Coe became the chairman for the latter phase of the bid. As Coe was a well-known personality in Olympic sport, it was felt he was better suited to the diplomatic finesse needed to secure the IOC's backing. Coe's presentation at the critical IOC meeting in July 2005 was viewed by commentators as being particularly effective, against tough competition from Paris and Madrid, and the London bid won the IOC's blessing on 6 July. In September 2008 Coe controversially told reporters \\"Fuck 'em\\" when asked about the opposition to the creation of a footballing Team GB from Scottish and Welsh supporters as reported in The London Paper. Coe attended the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver to see how the city coped with the challenges of hosting. Lord Coe noted the Games had \\"gradually recovered from its tumultuous start\\" and queried that he \\"never thought the British would find rivals in their preoccupation with the weather which is almost elevated to an Olympic event\\" as he credited VANOC for meeting unforeseen challenges such as the unseasonably warm weather of Cypress Mountain. Coe added \\"Rarely have I seen a host city so passionate and so ready to embrace the Games\\". Coe was instrumental in asking Queen Elizabeth II to star in Happy and Glorious a short film featuring James Bond which formed part of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. The director of the ceremony, Danny Boyle first pitched the idea to Coe, who loved it so much that he took it to Edward Young, Deputy Private Secretary to the Queen. A friend of Coe's from their days of advising William Hague, Young \\"listened sagely, laughed, and promised to ask the Boss\\". Word soon came back to Coe that she would love to take part. Coe has said that London 2012 is not only about five weeks of summer sport but about encouraging more people to take up sport at all levels of competition. Coe is the Patron of the British Dragon Boat Racing Association (BDA). Question: What was his job? Answer:","completion":"Sebastian Newbold Coe, or Seb Coe, held multiple positions throughout his career. Initially, he was a track and field athlete, specializing in middle-distance running. Later, he became a British politician. During London's bid for the 2012 Olympics, Coe served as an ambassador and later became the chairman of the bid company, leading the efforts to secure the IOC's backing for London as the host city.

As a young woman who was always interested in style, I got lucky in interning with a fashion company in Tokyo, last summer. I worked as an assistant in the Business Planning Department, helping with marketing for the 2007 Spring/Summer collections. Fashion is a beautiful industry. But against my expectation, it also has lots of ordinary work. Every day, I would do sample testing, prepare the brochure for future launches, and meet with customers and visitors. Japanese companies had a traditional work style. We had a meeting every morning at 9 o'clock. Every Monday, all employees, including those in other parts ofprefix = st1 /Japan, would take part in a conference call. Every afternoon, after finishing work, each of us would say goodbye to every manager in the company, which took more than five minutes. All of this kept me fresh. And the strict work atmosphere caused me to work harder. At the end of last August, the company's 2007 Spring/Summer collection started with a big show and was very successful. Lots of customers showed an interest in our products, including a businessman from Hong Kong. He went to our company for more details on the products, but he couldn't speak Japanese and none of the staff spoke good English. Just when the situation seemed helpless, I offered to give it a try. I was a Japanese major, but I had also practiced my English often. My translation job was praised by both the customer and my boss. And the guest made a big purchase. The two-month internship taught me a lot about business. And the pay - 150,000 yen, or over 10,000 yuan a month- was enough to cover my daily living costs inTokyo. Moreover, the experience made me stand out. Every interviewer I've spoken with showed an interest and discussed my internship with me.

Answer the question...who put the chapters and verses in the bible??","completion":"To answer the question of who put the chapters and verses in the Bible, I will divide my response into two parts: chapters and verses. 1. Chapters: The division of the Bible into chapters can be credited to Stephen Langton, an Archbishop of Canterbury. Langton introduced chapter divisions around 1227 AD to make it easier to reference specific passages in the scriptures. This categorization allowed for a more systematic study of the texts and facilitated public readings. 2. Verses: The person responsible for dividing the Bible into verses is Robert Estienne, also known as Robert Stephanus. He was a French printer and classical scholar who introduced this system during the 16th century. Specifically, he applied the verse divisions in his printed editions of the Bible: the Latin Vulgate in 1551 and the Greek New Testament in 1555. Just like with chapters, the division into verses provided easier referencing and improved overall navigation throughout the texts. In conclusion, the Bible is divided into chapters and verses, with Stephen Langton responsible for the formation of chapters and Robert Estienne for the distinction of verses. Both contributions have significantly impacted the way people study and reference the Bible today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Why do you think this is? What could have caused these features? There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Where did glaciers go? Where can you see them today? Glaciers are masses of flowing ice. Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are glaciers and what affect do they have on land?\\" is \\"A large river that erodes soil\\"? Pick your answer from: a). no b). yes","completion":"a). no Glaciers are not large rivers that erode soil. They are masses of flowing ice formed from compacted snow that accumulate over time. Glaciers significantly influence landscapes through processes like erosion, transportation, and deposition of rocks and sediments, which help in shaping and modifying the land over time. In the context provided, the central part of Illinois is relatively flat because glaciers moved across this area during the last ice age. The massive ice sheet, around a mile thick, smoothed out the surface as it slowly advanced and retreated, depositing materials it had eroded and carried along the way. This created the flat landscape you can observe today. As you move further south to the rolling hills of southern Illinois, the landscape there was less influenced by the glaciers, allowing the natural topography to remain more varied and hilly. Glaciers still exist today, primarily found in colder regions such as Greenland, Antarctica, and high mountain ranges like the Himalayas and the Alps.

Step 3: Evaluate the logical connection between premise and hypothesis In order to determine if the premise supports the hypothesis, we must examine whether the writhing motion described in the premise could be an indication of Derry being zapped. Step 4: Compare writhing motion to the zapping hypothesis Writhing could be a reaction caused by multiple factors, such as feeling pain, discomfort, or experiencing sensory overload from being connected to the circuitry mesh. One possible cause of the writhing could be electric shock (being zapped), which can cause involuntary muscle contractions and discomfort. Step 5: Assess if the premise implies the hypothesis Since the writhing motion could be caused by multiple factors and not exclusively by electric shocks, it is not possible to definitively conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is true as well. While the hypothesis is plausible, there are other possible explanations for Derry's writhing motion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of war materiel during the Second World War, such as the Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power the Spitfire, Hurricane, Mosquito and the Lancaster. The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316 workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000 engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact of bomb damage on production. The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built more than 800 Percival Proctor aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby Barton Aerodrome. Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for Churchill tanks, munitions, Bailey bridges, and much else. ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce penicillin in quantity.As an important industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of December 1940. On the night of 23 December 1940, the Metropolitan-Vickers aircraft factory in Mosley Road was badly damaged, with the loss of the first 13 MV-built Avro Manchester bombers in final assembly. The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended.In the December 1940 air raids, stray bombs aiming for Trafford Park landed on Old Trafford football stadium, the nearby home of Manchester United, but this air raid only resulted in minor damage and matches were soon being played at the stadium again. On 11 March 1941, however, stray bombs aimed at Trafford Park fell onto Old Trafford for a second time, causing serious damage to the stadium. It was comprehensively rebuilt after the war and re-opened in 1949, until which time Manchester United played their home games at Maine Road, the stadium of Manchester City in Moss Side.At the outbreak of war in...

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Urban Legends: Final Cut Context: Amy Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison) is unsure about her thesis. But after a conversation with security guard Reese Wilson (Loretta Devine) about her experience with a series of murders that had happened on the campus she had previously worked in, she decides to make a film about a serial killer murdering in the fashion of urban legends. Meanwhile, a student named Lisa (Jacinda Barrett) feels dazed and prepares to leave the bar, when someone abducts her. She wakes up in a bathtub filled with ice and discovers that her kidney was removed. Attacked by her abductor, she tries to flee through the window and is decapitated in the process. Lisa is not missed as she was about to go on a trip. The next day, Amy is preparing the shooting of her thesis film but is deserted by the assigned camera man, Toby Belcher (Anson Mount), who accuses Amy of stealing his thesis idea. Shooting begins with another camera man, Simon. When Sandra (Jessica Cauffiel), Amy's actress friend who played a victim in a scene, returns to an empty studio after forgetting her keys, she is attacked and slashed to death with a straight razor by the same killer who killed Lisa. Her friends witness her death when the material is smuggled into a sequence of takes of the scene, but discount it as another piece of acting, wondering who shot it. As there is no body and Sandra was about to go on a trip, her disappearance goes unnoticed. Travis (Matthew Davis) is found to have committed suicide at the campus tower. At the funeral, Amy is offered help by Graham (Joey Lawrence), a student from a prosperous Hollywood background. She refuses, wishing to make it on her own. This offends Graham, who thinks it hypocritical, as Amy grew up in Hollywood as the daughter of a famous documentary film maker before moving to Chicago. After she has detected the assault on Simon on the tapes, she is confronted by the killer. During the ensuing chase, she loses the tapes and cannot prove her claims to a skeptical Reese.

She hits a bad bump driving home drunk on a dark road. Later, hearing noises in the garage, she finds a bleeding man, mangled and impaled on her jeep's bumper. Not calling 911, she tries to help, but he suddenly attacks. Panicked, she hits him with a golf club. After that, she buries his body in a shallow grave in the woods off Clover Rd. The next day, Mary covers up the crime (before parents return from a weekend trip); she scrubs off the blood but doesn't get the dent fixed (a suspicious cop at the auto shop scares her off, then she detours for her grandmas parrots at airport cargo). Mary starts coming apart. Irrational, she crashes on a tree to camouflage the small dent with a bigger dent. Later the news reveals the missing man is kindergarten teacher Timothy Emser (Kevin Corrigan), bipolar and unstable when he vanished. Strange things occur in Mary's house, making her feel toyed with by someone unseen; she descends into paranoia. It transpires that Rick (Christopher Shand), her boyfriend, gets involved in the cover up and goes to retrieve incriminatory evidence (a blanket) off the corpse, but is killed, replaced in Emser's grave.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: The throttle body is the point that your intake meets the engine and the air is funneled into the intake manifold. In many applications, installing a throttle body with a larger diameter will allow even more air to flow into the engine, resulting in an increase of power. Throttle bodies are often held in place with four bolts and will require a new gasket to be placed between the throttle body and intake manifold when installed. Throttle body diameter is usually measured in millimeters. Swapping a 65 millimeter throttle body for a 75 millimeter one can dramatically increase the air that flows into the engine. You can purchase throttle bodies with larger diameters at many auto parts stores or online performance marketplaces. Make sure to purchase a throttle body designed for your specific year, make and model of vehicle. Replacing the pistons in your engine is a significant project, but the resulting horsepower increase can be equally as significant. In many vehicles, you will need to remove the entire engine to replace the pistons, but in some you can actually remove the oil pan and crank shaft, followed by the piston rods and pistons. If installing forced induction like a turbocharger or supercharger, you should choose pistons made of forged steel as opposed to the more common cast steel. Forged steel can withstand higher pressures and temperatures. There are a number of steps involved in replacing pistons, many of which are best left to professionals. The camshaft or shafts in your engine have the important task of opening and closing the intake and exhaust valves that allow the air and fuel to enter the engine and the exhaust to exit it at just the right time. Stock camshafts are designed with a combination of efficiency, power, fuel economy and emissions in mind, but replacing them with more specialized ones can dramatically increase the power output of the engine. Many modern vehicles come equipped with variable cam timing (such as Honda’s V-Tech), but even these cam shafts can be replaced for more specialized applications. Pushrod motors have a camshaft located in the engine block, whereas modular motors will have them in the cylinder heads. Just as replacing components of the exhaust system will increase the efficiency of the exhaust exiting the engine, aftermarket exhaust manifolds designed with larger diameter pipes and equal length piping will improve the balance and efficiency of the way exhaust exits your engine. Aftermarket exhaust manifolds are commonly referred to as headers, and can add significant power to your vehicle. In many four-cylinder vehicles, the exhaust manifold is bolted to the cylinder head at the front of the car. Turbochargers are mounted to the exhaust manifold of turbocharged vehicles, and the increased efficiency of headers will have an even more dramatic effect on the power output of such vehicles. Many four cylinder sports cars now come equipped with turbochargers. These turbochargers produce more pressure than regular atmospheric air can, forcing more air into the engine than would otherwise be possible. Installing an aftermarket boost controller on the vacuum line between the turbocharger and waste gate can allow you to increase the amount of boost the turbocharger produces. Remember that your engine needs to maintain an appropriate air/fuel ratio, so never increase the boost more than your specific vehicle’s fuel system can support. An aftermarket boost gauge can be considered mandatory for this modification to ensure you know exactly how many PSI of boost your vehicle is producing. An air/fuel or exhaust gas temperature gauge can help you ensure you are supporting the increased air flow with enough fuel.","completion":"The throttle body plays a crucial role in regulating the airflow into the engine, ultimately impacting the vehicle's power. By installing a throttle body with a larger diameter, air intake can be increased, leading to a subsequent increase in power. This important component needs to be compatible with the vehicle's specific year, make, and model. In addition to the throttle body, replacing the engine's pistons can lead to a significant horsepower increase. This complex process may require removing the entire engine, and it's best to use forged steel pistons for their ability to withstand higher pressures and temperatures. Due to the involved nature of this modification, seeking professional help is recommended. Camshafts control the opening and closing of intake and exhaust valves, allowing for the right amount of air and fuel to enter the engine and exhaust to be expelled. Replacing stock camshafts with specialized ones can greatly increase the engine's power output. Some modern vehicles may have variable cam timing for enhanced performance, but even these can be replaced for specific applications. One key component of the exhaust system is the exhaust manifold, which can also be altered to increase power. Aftermarket exhaust manifolds, or headers, feature larger diameter pipes and equal length piping for greater exhaust efficiency. This modification particularly benefits turbocharged vehicles, which rely on effective turbochargers for increased air intake. Installing an aftermarket boost controller on turbocharged engines allows for greater boost and power output. However, it's essential to maintain an appropriate air/fuel ratio and not exceed the fuel system's capacity. As a result, it's imperative to have precise gauges installed for monitoring crucial parameters, such as boost, air/fuel ratio, and exhaust gas temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You should never use a curling iron on wet hair, as it causes breakage and burning. Instead, make sure your hair is completely dry before curling it. Before you start curling, make sure your hair is free of tangles and snares by running a brush or comb through it. You can apply a detangling spray or serum if necessary, as well. Before you use your curling iron, apply a setting spray or hairspray to help the curls hold. You can also use a product like wave-enhancing spray, mousse, or gel, to help give your hair body and set the curls. Let it dry before you start curling your hair. Look for a setting spray that doubles as a heat protectant to prevent hair damage from the curling iron. To get extra curly hair, you need to use a small curling iron to create fairly tight curls. Choose a curling iron with a ¾ inch to 1-inch barrel to get small curls. Larger barrels will create a wavy, rather than curly, look. Begin with a small section at the crown (or top) of your head and work your way through the top portion of your hair. Then, curl the next highest layer all the way around before moving lower. Many people also start curling from the bottom, but it won’t make a big difference either way. Open the handle and close the hair in the curling iron. Start in the middle of the section, rather than clamping it at the end, to create curls that last all day. Begin twirling the iron so that the hair wraps around it. Then, gently release the clamp and slide the iron down the hair. Clamp it and roll it again. Continue this process until you reach the ends of your hair. Then roll the iron until it is close to, but not touching, your scalp. Clamping the middle of your hair in the iron and working your way toward the ends will create longer lasting curls that rolling the iron from the bottom of your hair up. Hold the curl in place for 5 seconds before releasing it. Then, open up the iron and pull the handle down, letting go of the curl. After you make the curl, wrap it around your finger in a small loop or bun. When you have it wrapped, use a bobby pin or single prong hair clip to secure it to your head. This process will help your curls set, and it keeps them out of your way as you curl the rest of your hair. As you go, alternate the amount of hair you curl at one time and well as the direction in which you roll the hair. Doing so will give you a bit more volume, as well as curls in different sizes and orientations, which will make them look more natural. Continue curling one piece of hair at a time until all your hair is curled. If you have a lot of hair and are curling small sections, this may take a while. While your curls are setting, spritz them with hairspray before unpinning them. Allow the hairspray to dry completely before you remove the bobby pins. Release the bobby pins, and unroll the curls. Shake your curls out, then use your fingers to separate them. Scrunch up or twist the curls with your fingers, creating the shape you want. Don’t brush out your curls, as this will undo all the work you’ve put in and create frizziness. You can apply a finishing product to set the style, if desired.

In which battle day group A would have more openings in their nest thatch, battle day three or battle day four? In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. Hint: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Group A would have more openings in their nest thatch on battle day three. This is because on battle day three, Group A territory had low air humidity, while on battle day four, the territory had high air humidity. Acromyrmex heyeri ants adjust the openings in their nest thatch for temperature regulation and to reduce water loss for the colony. When the temperature is between 20-30 °C, they create more openings in the nest thatch to let heat out. However, when air humidity decreases, the ants will close the openings to reduce water loss. Since battle day four had high air humidity, the ants would likely close the openings in the nest thatch to conserve water, whereas on battle day three with low air humidity, they would open the thatch to help regulate temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wynan Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"A Web of Blackmail\\" Genre: Thriller/Drama Plot: In a quiet suburban town, lives Michael Cooper, a middle-aged man with a seemingly perfect life: beautiful wife, lovely kids, and a successful career. However, beneath his calm demeanor, Cooper hides his secret life as a prolific blackmailer, preying on wealthy individuals to maintain his luxurious lifestyle. One day, Cooper crosses paths with Maxwell Wynan, a prominent businessman, and philanthropist with a dark past. Cooper discovers that Wynan was involved in a hit-and-run accident many years ago that resulted in a young girl's death. To protect his reputation and family, Wynan went above and beyond to cover up the incident. After digging up concrete evidence, Cooper makes his move and starts blackmailing Wynan. At first, Wynan caves under the pressure and complies with Cooper's demands. He fears losing everything he has worked for, as well as the love of his family. He also worries that his long-buried secret will destroy his community standing, forcing him to accept the deal. However, Wynan soon grows desperate for a way out. With the help of his trusted assistant, Lila, he develops a counter-plan: they will search for Michael Cooper's past and find any incriminating evidence to turn the tables and free him from Cooper's grip. Through their investigation, they unveil that Cooper is notorious for this behavior and may be tied to unsolved extortion cases. As the intensity builds, both parties begin to manipulate the people around them in their ongoing battle of control. Cooper becomes merciless, targeting the people Wynan loves most, and forcing Wynan to take increasingly desperate measures to protect them. What starts as a simple blackmail scheme evolves into a complex game of cat-and-mouse where the stakes are high. Friends and family are entangled in the crossfire, leaving both men doubting everyone around them. Tensions culminate in a dramatic showdown where Cooper and Wynan confront one another. In the climax, Lila betrays Wynan by providing Cooper with some crucial evidence to eliminate Wynan for her personal reasons. Cooper goes for the kill, but in the last moment, Lila double-crosses Cooper and hands the information to the authorities, leading to Cooper's arrest and, ultimately, his downfall. Lila reveals that she, too, had been manipulated by Cooper earlier. As a result, she wanted to put an end to the web of blackmail and deceit Cooper constructed.

The population of Canada is about 29 million and the capital is Ottawa. The country covers about 9,980,000 square kilometers and six of the world's 24 time areas as well. There are two official languages spoken in Canada: French and English. Many people can speak both English and French. More than 60% of Canadians speak English as their language. About 25% of the Canadians speak French. In one province of Canada where French is the common language, the programmes on TV and radios as well as the teaching in schools are all in French. Today, Chinese has become the first inofficial language in Canada. Canada's climate is not as cold all year around as some may believe. In winter, temperatures fall below freezing point throughout most of Canada. In summer, the southern provinces often experience high levels of temperatures that can reach over 30degC regularly. The weather in Canada is just like the weather in China. It is rather cold in the north while it is fairly warm in the south. Winters in the north last long with snow for half a year. As the cold northern climate, only one-fifth of the land is suitable for farming. As it is known to all, Canada has one-third of the world's supply of fresh water. It has many great lakes. There are five great lakes in the south. And there are many others, especially in the north. It is also rich in natural resources, such as coal, oil, natural gas of which Canadians make use to produce energy. People of northern Canada are called Inuit , who came from Asia and settled in Canada about 4,000 years ago. They used to travel around from place to place with teams of dogs which pulled their baggage. Now, they seldom move. There are about 2,500 Inuit in all. The government has started a new school project in which Inuit teach their own young children. So it is hoped that the way of Inuit life will be kept alive for more centuries.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the dishwasher operation process: 1. Dirty dishes are rinsed: Before placing dishes in the dishwasher, it is recommended to rinse off food debris and other particles. This preliminary action can help reduce the load on the dishwasher and minimize the risk of clogging its filters or drain. 2. Dishes are placed into the dishwasher: Positioning dishes in the dishwasher should be done thoughtfully to maximize efficiency and cleaning performance. Larger items should be placed on the bottom rack, while smaller ones and glassware can go on the top rack. Ensure that the dishwasher is not overloaded or underloaded to attain optimal results. 3. A detergent is added to the detergent dispenser: Utilizing a suitable detergent is vital to achieving clean and spotless dishes. Measure the appropriate amount of detergent according to the manufacturer's instructions and place it in the dishwasher's detergent dispenser. 4. The dishwasher is closed, and the power is turned on: After the dishwasher is filled with dishes and detergent, close the door securely, and choose an appropriate cycle based on the types of dishes or level of dirtiness. The dishwasher will then start the cleaning process. 5. In about 1.5-2 hours, the dishes are clean: The duration of the dishwasher's cycle will depend on factors such as the selected program, the appliance's capacity, and the level of dirtiness. After the cycle is completed, the dishwasher will signal that the process has ended. At this point, open the dishwasher, let the steam escape, and wait a few minutes for the dishes to cool down before unloading. Now, to address the question: \\"Suppose the dishes are already clean; how will it affect hurting the dishwasher to clean better?\\" The options presented are more (A), less (B), and no effect (C). Considering that the dishwasher functions effectively when both dirty and rinsed dishes are inserted, putting already clean dishes in the dishwasher would not necessarily cause harm. However, it would be less efficient in terms of water and energy consumption. Consequently, Option B: \\"less\\" would be the most accurate answer, as the dishwasher might \\"clean better\\" with an accurate assessment of dish cleanliness and proper utilization of resources. It is essential to remember that while placing already clean dishes in the dishwasher may not have an immediate effect on the appliance's performance, consistently running unnecessary cycles will waste energy, water and detergent, as well as cause additional wear and tear on the dishwasher, resulting in a shortened lifespan or potential long-term damage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: The black-and-white aerial footage shows a line of purported Taliban insurgents slowly walking along a path in a lightly forested desert in Afghanistan's western Farah province. Suddenly, the screen flashes to white as the men disappear in a fireball — the result of a bomb dropped from a U.S. MQ-9 \\"Reaper\\" drone. \\"Taliban fighters on the run following Afghan-led offensive in #Farah province, #Afghanistan. Video shows U.S. airpower (MQ-9s) in support,\\" declared a short message accompanying the video, which was posted on the official account of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed. Less than 24 hours later, the U.S. Air Force posted its own Afghanistan-related tweet that raised eyebrows — this one referencing a viral audio clip that has sparked a lighthearted online debate among those who hear the word \\"Laurel\\" and others who hear \\"Yanny.\\" \\"The Taliban Forces in Farah city #Afghanistan would much rather have heard #Yanny or #Laurel than the deafening #BRRRT they got courtesy of our #A10,\\" read the Air Force tweet. The Air Force has since apologized and deleted the tweet, saying it was sent in \\"poor taste.\\" The USFOR-A tweet remains. In a statement to VOA, a Pentagon spokesperson said the tweets do not represent a new social media strategy. \\"As with any other organization, the post was an attempt to bring awareness to a major/ongoing organizational activity by tying it to references or conversations already trending with their established audiences,\\" said Lieutenant Colonel Kone Faulkner.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 2009, a genetically re-engineered measles virus, originally created as a cure for cancer, turns into a lethal strain which kills 94% of those it infects, mutates 5% into predatory, nocturnal mutants called \\"Darkseekers\\" who are extremely vulnerable to sunlight and other sources of UV, with only the remaining 1% immune. Three years after the outbreak, US Army virologist Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville (Will Smith) lives an isolated life in the ruins of New York City, which is now deserted, unsure if any other uninfected humans are left in the world. The effects of the virus vary in other species, animals that coexist with humans like rats and domestic dogs are infected but wild animals like deer and lions are unaffected. The city has fallen into ruins and overgrown vegetation covers crumbling buildings and wild deer roam the streets while being preyed upon by lions that have escaped Central Park Zoo. Neville's daily routine includes experimentation on infected rats to find a cure for the virus and trips through Manhattan to hunt for food and supplies. He also waits each day for a response to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which instruct any uninfected survivors to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. Flashbacks reveal that his wife (Salli Richardson) and daughter (Willow Smith) died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan, prior to the military-enforced quarantine of the island in 2009, in which Neville stays behind on the island as military personnel. Neville's loneliness is mitigated by the companionship of his German Shepherd Sam (given to him by his daughter Marley as a puppy to protect him before she died in the helicopter crash), interaction with mannequins he has set up as patrons at a video store, and recordings of old television broadcasts. At night, he barricades himself and Sam inside his heavily fortified Washington Square Park home to hide from the Darkseekers. One day while waiting for survivors, Sam follows a deer into a dark building....

He is 35 and cannot go on forever but United would be crazy not to try to keep the Swedish striker for another season because he has shown he still has such a lot to offer. As well as his 24 goals in 37 games for United, a big part of Ibrahimovic's impact is the effect he has had on his team-mates. His influence has been compared with that of Old Trafford legend Eric Cantona - and I can understand why. We know Ibrahimovic has got fantastic individual ability, but his charisma and the way he carries himself has seen him become the team's talisman. Media playback is not supported on this device It must be brilliant for United's young players - like Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard - to be around someone with Ibrahimovic's appetite, energy and desire. They can learn some things from him on the pitch during games, of course, but working with him every day and seeing his attitude in training and the dressing room will be invaluable experience for them. That is another reason for United to keep him, although even if he does stay I am pretty certain they will still go for a big-hitter in the summer to either play with him up front, or compete for his place. Ibrahimovic's mentality has not changed despite everything he has done in his career - he is still determined to be the best. He has played in the vast majority of United's games this season, which for someone his age is a superb achievement - in all competitions, Leicester's Wes Morgan is the only Premier League player to play more minutes. It is not as if Ibrahimovic is taking it easy, either. His languid style means it does not always look as if he is doing a lot of running during games, but he typically covers 9km every 90 minutes - the same distance per match as a striker as hard-working as Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, for example. All of that helps to show Ibrahimovic's hunger, and also demonstrates he is still a supreme athlete. However, both of those statistics would be overlooked if he was not scoring goals too. They are the really impressive thing and set him apart from other 35-year-old footballers. They have made a big difference for United too. His goal against Blackburn in the FA Cup on Sunday was his ninth winner in all competitions this season. Altogether his goals have earned United 11 points in the Premier League alone - a joint league high for 2016-17 with Chelsea's Diego Costa. Media playback is not supported on this device I played in the Premier League until I was almost 36 and to compete at that age you need to have a hunger in training, not just want to keep playing more games. On a day-to-day basis you have to keep pushing yourself. Your body is taking more and more punishment and it becomes harder and harder to get through it. You need to have huge willpower, but you also need a manager who understands what you need - when you need a rest, and when you do and don't need to train. Ibrahimovic has that in Jose Mourinho, which is great, but he still has to go out and do the business on the pitch. Mourinho has helped him there too because he knows he has a player who needs feeding, and their style of play does precisely that. The key for United is getting the ball up to Ibrahimovic, then getting players around him and running beyond him to deliver it into the box. They were not quite managing it earlier in the season but now they have found a way of making it work that suits Ibrahimovic and, more importantly, the team. If you give Ibrahimovic chances, the rest is up to him. United have been doing the first bit - he has had more shots at goal this season than any other Premier League player. Then of course his ability takes over, which is why he is delivering the goods. Media playback is not supported on this device Ibrahimovic has already been a winner at Wembley this season, when his goal against Leicester clinched the Community Shield. On Sunday he will get the chance to get his hands on more silverware when his side play Southampton in the EFL Cup final (16:30 GMT kick-off), but United will not be taking success for granted. Not many people gave Southampton a chance over two legs against Liverpool in the semi-finals and I think they have enough going forward to cause United problems. It will be a blow for United if Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Michael Carrick miss the game through injury, as Mourinho fears, but United will still rightly go into the game as favourites. Ibrahimovic's form obviously marks him out as their danger man, and he has already scored twice against Saints this season when he got off the mark at Old Trafford with both goals in a United win in August. So Southampton will know how big a threat he is when the ball comes into their box - what might decide the game is whether they can stop him this time.

The Sweet (also known as Sweet) is a British glam rock band that rose to worldwide fame in the 1970s. Their best known line-up consisted of lead vocalist Brian Connolly, bass player Steve Priest, guitarist Andy Scott, and drummer Mick Tucker. The group was originally called Sweetshop. The band was formed in London in 1968 and achieved their first hit, \\"Funny Funny\\", in 1971 after teaming up with songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman and record producer Phil Wainman. Guitarist Mick Stewart joined in 1969. Stewart had some rock pedigree, having previously worked with The (Ealing) Redcaps and Simon Scott & The All-Nite Workers in the mid-1960s. In late 1965, that band became The Phil Wainman Set when the future Sweet producer joined on drums and the group cut some singles with Errol Dixon. In early 1966, Stewart left and later worked with Johnny Kidd & The Pirates. The Sweet signed a new record contract with EMI's Parlophone label. Three bubblegum pop singles were released: \\"Lollipop Man\\" (September 1969), \\"All You'll Ever Get from Me\\" (January 1970), and a cover version of the Archies' \\"Get on the Line\\" (June 1970), all of which failed to chart. Stewart then quit, and was not replaced for some time. Connolly and Tucker had a chance meeting with Wainman, who was now producing, and knew of two aspiring songwriters, Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, who were looking for a group to sing over some demos they had written together. Connolly, Priest and Tucker provided the vocals on a track called \\"Funny Funny\\" which featured Pip Williams on guitar, John Roberts on bass and Wainman on drums. The latter began offering the track to various recording companies. The band held auditions for a replacement guitarist and settled on Welsh-born Andy Scott. He had most recently been playing with Mike McCartney (brother of Paul) in the Scaffold. As a member of the Elastic Band, he had played guitar on two singles for Decca, \\"Think of You Baby\\" and \\"Do Unto Others\\". He also appeared on the band's lone album release, Expansions on Life, and on some recordings by the Scaffold. The band rehearsed for a number of weeks before Scott made his live debut with Sweet on 26 September 1970 at the Windsor Ballroom in Redcar. The Sweet initially attempted to combine various musical influences, including the Monkees and 1960s bubblegum pop groups such as the Archies, with more heavy rock-oriented groups such as the Who. The Sweet adopted the rich vocal harmony style of the Hollies, with distorted guitars and a heavy rhythm section. This fusion of pop and hard rock would remain a central trademark of Sweet's music and prefigured the glam metal of a few years later. The Sweet's initial album appearance was on the budget label Music for Pleasure as part of a compilation called Gimme Dat Ding, released in December 1970. The Sweet had one side of the record; the Pipkins (whose sole hit, \\"Gimme Dat Ding\\", gave the LP its name) had the other. The Sweet side consisted of the A- and B-sides of the band's three Parlophone singles. Andy Scott appears in the album cover shot, even though he did not play on any of the recordings. Any interesting info on band members?","completion":"Brian Connolly (Lead Vocals): Brian Connolly was born on October 5, 1945, in Govanhill, Glasgow, Scotland. Before joining The Sweet, Connolly was a part of several bands, including Wainwright's Gentlemen and The Army. His charismatic stage presence and powerful vocals played a significant role in the success of The Sweet. Unfortunately, he struggled with alcoholism, which ultimately affected his vocal abilities and led to his departure from the band in 1979. Connolly pursued a solo career and occasionally performed with a new version of The Sweet, called \\"Brian Connolly's Sweet.\\" He passed away on February 9, 1997, due to liver failure. Steve Priest (Bass, Vocals): Born on February 23, 1948, in Hayes, Middlesex, England, Steve Priest started playing bass at the age of 16. He formed The Sweet with Brian Connolly, Mick Tucker, and later Andy Scott. Priest was known for his flamboyant stage outfits and theatrical performances. He contributed lead and backing vocals to various songs and played a vital role in shaping the band's sound. After The Sweet's breakup in 1981, Priest released a solo album and eventually formed a new version of the band called \\"Steve Priest's Sweet\\" in 2008. He continued performing with his version of the band until his death on June 4, 2020. Andy Scott (Guitar, Vocals): Born on June 30, 1949, in Wrexham, Wales, Andy Scott was a skilled guitarist and songwriter. He joined The Sweet in 1970 and his addition to the lineup proved instrumental in their success. His guitar work and songwriting abilities helped the band transition from bubblegum pop to a heavier rock sound. Scott contributed songs like \\"The Ballroom Blitz,\\" \\"Fox on the Run,\\" and \\"Love is Like Oxygen.\\" Following the band's breakup, Scott had a brief solo career before forming the \\"Andy Scott's Sweet\\" in the late 1980s. He has continued to tour with his version of the band to the present day. Mick Tucker (Drums, Vocals): Born on July 17, 1947, in Harlesden, North West London, England, drummer Mick Tucker was a founding member of The Sweet. Before joining the band, Tucker was a part of Wainwright's Gentlemen with Brian Connolly. Known for his energetic, powerful, and precise drumming, Tucker contributed heavily to The Sweet's signature sound. He also provided backing vocals for several songs. After the band's breakup in 1981, he formed a group called \\"Tucker Brown\\" and later reunited with Andy Scott to perform as The Sweet. Tucker passed away on February 14, 2002, after battling leukemia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Given the following context: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral.... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who is believed to have spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries?","completion":"The last name of the person who is believed to have spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries is Lochner.

After arguing with her husband, Liza Murphy walked out of their home in Emerson, New Jersey, leaving behind her purse, her cigarettes, her cell phone and her three children, her husband told police. There has been no sign of her since August 19, 2007. Liza Murphy has been missing from her home in Emerson, New Jersey, since August 19, 2007. Murphy's friends and family reported her missing the next day. \\"In my heart, I fear the worst, that my daughter is gone,\\" said her mother, Sophia Stellatos. Police searched extensively for Murphy, especially around a reservoir not far from her home, but they found nothing. Cadaver dogs caught her scent near the George Washington Bridge, but the trail went cold, police told the family. Deepening the mystery, her husband, Joe Murphy, tried to take his own life a few days after his wife disappeared by walking into oncoming traffic and throwing himself in front of a fire truck, police say. He was hospitalized and recovered from his injuries, but police say he hired a lawyer and is no longer cooperating with investigators. His lawyer said Murphy, an Irish immigrant, has nothing to hide from the authorities. He said his client has no criminal record and no history of violence. Attorney Joseph Rem added that there was no physical violence in the marriage. According to her family, Liza Murphy, 42, was not the type of person to take off on her own without letting her family know.

Stellatos described Joe Murphy as possessive of his wife, never allowing her to go out with her friends. She said he was even jealous if she spent time with her parents. Rem pointed out that his client has not been named as a suspect or a person of interest in the case. He said police have not asked to speak to his client recently. Liza Murphy's children are 15, 13 and 10 years old now. Joe Murphy has full custody of them, and the Stellatoses have not seen their grandchildren since shortly before their daughter disappeared. Murphy and her children had spent the week before her disappearance visiting with her parents, who live about 125 miles away. They returned the Friday before Murphy's disappearance.

She wore corrective shoes as a toddler after being born with a club foot. Hamm spent her childhood on various United States Air Force bases around the world with her family. While living in Florence, Italy, Hamm first played soccer, which was hugely popular there; her entire family quickly became involved in the sport. On May 22, 1999, Hamm broke the all-time international goal record with her 108th goal in a game against Brazil in Orlando, Florida. The following month, she led the national team at the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, hosted by the United States. During the team's first group stage match against Denmark, she scored her 110th international goal and served an assist to Julie Foudy as the U.S. won 3-0. Against Nigeria, Hamm's low free kick was knocked into the goal by a Nigerian midfielder. Within a minute, Hamm scored with a free kick. She later served an assist to Kristine Lilly before being substituted in the 57th minute. The U.S. won 7-1 and secured a berth in the quarter-finals. During the team's final group stage match, head coach Tony DiCicco rested a number of players, including Hamm, who was substituted at half-time. The U.S. defeated Korea 3-0 and finished Group A with nine points. In the quarter-finals, the U.S. defeated Germany 3-2.

I consider this to be false advertising. When Footsmart was contacted they said this was the only way they could think of to describe the closure because velcro is a trademark. Come on guys, this is not rocket science. I really think the reason for this description is to fool the public into buying this item. It also feels like one has a backpack on one's back. It produces a noticable \\"hump\\" on the back which is what I am trying to prevent by wearing such a contraption. Needless to say, I am returning this product asap.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. and the situation: Two students studied animal behavior for the biology class. Ned studied more about predators, while Kim studied more about herbivores. Answer the following question: Which student studied less about wolves? Answer:","completion":"Kim studied less about wolves, as she focused more on herbivores while Ned studied more about predators, which include wolves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Bamboozled Movie plot: In a New York City residence, Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) rises to begin his daily routine. Brushing his teeth, he gives us by voice over a definition of satire. He tells us that with the rise of the Internet, video and interactive games, his field as a television writer has seen a drop in popularity. Meanwhile, in a dilapidated building, squatter Womack (Tommy Davidson) wakes up his friend Manray (Savion Glover) for a day of work. This consists of travelling to the CNS (Continental Network System) building where Delacroix works, and Manray tap dancing to entertain the workers. They then collect money from the workers. The men see Delacroix walk by, and ask him for monetary help in the form of work of some kind.Delacroix walks into a staff meeting late and is immediately castigated by his boss, Thomas Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport). Dunwitty informs the staff that CNS has poor ratings. He says he wants them to write funnier material, and ends the meeting. In the privacy of his office, Dunwitty tells Delacroix that the material Delacroix's been writing for him seems like it's about white people with black faces. Dunwitty asserts that Delacroix is an \\"oreo\\" with his Harvard education, because he won't write a \\"n----r show.\\"The next day, Delacroix and his assistant Sloan Hopkins (Jada Pinkett Smith) talk. They've decided that Manray is the solution to his problem. Delacroix plans to write a show that will be so \\"offensive and racist,\\" it will prove his point that the network only wants to see black buffoons on the air. Delacroix simply hopes to be fired, so he can be let go of his contract with CNS. Manray and Womack ask at the receptionist's desk for a \\"Delapoint\\" and the men working there tell them to step outside. However, Sloan steps into the lobby, sees what's happening, and escorts Manray and Womack to Delacroix's office. Delacroix explains to them that he has an idea for a television pilot, and they can make money with it. His main request is that Manray changes his name to Mantan, in an apparent homage... My question: What does Delacroix make his gunshot wound appear to be?

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the equation -197 - 532 = -89*h - 70*h + 1020 for h, we will follow these steps: 1. Combine the constants on the left side of the equation. 2. Combine the h terms on the right side of the equation. 3. Isolate h by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of h. Let's work through these steps: Step 1: Combine the constants on the left side of the equation. -197 - 532 = -729 So the equation becomes: -729 = -89*h - 70*h + 1020 Step 2: Combine the h terms on the right side of the equation. -89*h - 70*h = -159*h Now the equation is: -729 = -159*h + 1020 Step 3: Isolate the 1020 constant on the right side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. -729 - 1020 = -159*h -1749 = -159*h Now, to isolate h, we need to divide both sides by -159. h = -1749 / -159 h ≈ 11 So, the solution to the equation is h ≈ 11."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},R={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
