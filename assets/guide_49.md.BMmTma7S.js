They like to remember their first love or their first car. But not all firsts are happy ones. One of history's bad but important firsts was the first car accident. Cars were still young when it happened. The accident took place in New York City in May 1896. A man from Massachusetts was visiting the city in his new car. At that time, bicycle riders were still trying to get used to the new set of wheels on the road. No one was sure who was to blame for it. Anyway, the bike and the car hit each other hard. The man on the bike was injured. The driver of the car had to stay in jail and wait for the hospital report on the bicycle rider. Luckily, the rider was not killed. Three years later, another car accident took place. It was again in New York City. A man named Henry Bliss stepped off a streetcar . He was hit by a passing car. Once again, no one was sure just how it happened or whose fault it was. The driver of the car was put in prison. Poor Mr. Bliss became the first person to die in a car accident.

Article: People can't survive for more than three or four days without fresh water. Go inland and try to find a water source from a stream or waterfall on the island. If it's completely barren, then you'll need to create a solar still and take advantage of rainfall when it occurs. A solar still uses the sun to create condensation. Dig a hole in the ground and put a container at the bottom. Surround the hole with wet leaves, then put a large piece of plastic down over the hole and weigh it down. Condensation will collect in your container and you'll be able to drink it. When it rains, make sure that you are filling up containers to catch the fresh water to keep you hydrated for the long run. Boil the water before you drink it. Check for water at the base of leaves or cacti, inside of caves, hollowed trees, or undercut banks. You can also get water from coconuts, cacti, or other plants and fruits. Collect rainwater in buckets, plastic containers, bins, or garbage cans. Heating the water above 185° F (85° C) for three minutes will kill all pathogens in your water. Severe dehydration could cause low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, delirium, or unconsciousness. Do not drink salt water from the ocean because it will dehydrate you. While your body is capable of surviving one to three weeks without any food, not eating will weaken you, and it will make it harder to do other things that are required to survive on a desert island. Eat fruits and vegetables that you know not to be poisonous like coconuts, bananas, and seaweed. Avoid potentially poisonous, unknown berries. Scurvy is a serious condition that occurs when you don't have a balanced diet. Symptoms include fatigue, anemia, and infections and is caused by a vitamin C deficiency. Eating fresh citrus fruits like lemons and oranges can help prevent the condition. The protein and nutrients from meat and fish will give you energy. Mollusks, clams, oysters, crabs, muscles, and fish are all things that you may be able to find in the shallow waters surrounding or on an island. You can sharpen sticks and hunt small reptiles, fish, or birds in the isle as well. If you're having trouble catching or trapping bigger game, locate slower moving insects that you can eat that live in the desert like beetles, spiders, and centipedes. Cook shellfish thoroughly before consuming it. Bacteria could cause you to become ill. If you cannot create a makeshift fishing pole, then sharpen a long branch or stick to make spears that you can use to go spearfishing. If you've never eaten the fruit that you find on the island, test it for poison by rubbing it on a sensitive part of your skin, like your wrist. Wait 45 minutes. If there is no adverse reaction, rub some of the food on your lips. If you form a rash, or there is burning or irritation, then the food is most likely poisonous. Never eat large amounts of any unknown food. Eat a small amount, wait an hour or two to see if you feel sick, then eat the rest of it. Beware of fruit that smells like peaches or almonds as it could be poisonous. Do not waste anything, even if you have an overabundance of it. Store away your excess food and water and stick to strict rationing. The body requires 32 ounces of water a day and 200-1500 calories of food for an average person. Try to ration as much as possible without becoming dehydrated or malnourished. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article would be: To survive on a desert island, it's crucial to find a fresh water source or collect rainwater using a solar still, as people can't survive more than a few days without water.

To answer the question, let's look at some of the notable stadiums in New Haven that have continued to host minor sport leagues: 1. Yale Bowl: Over its long history, the Yale Bowl has hosted numerous events, including minor league and international sporting events. Recently, it has been the primary venue for the Yale Bulldogs football team, which competes in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). 2. Veterans Memorial Coliseum: Although the Veterans Memorial Coliseum was demolished in 2007, it formerly hosted minor league hockey teams such as the New Haven Nighthawks, New Haven Senators, and the Beast of New Haven. As of now, there is no active replacement facility in the city. 3. Palmer Field: Palmer Field, located in the nearby town of Middletown, Connecticut, is a regional baseball field that continues to host CIAC high school championships games, American Legion Baseball, and other regional and local baseball events. 4. Reese Stadium: Reese Stadium is home to Yale's men's and women's soccer and lacrosse teams. While not a minor league stadium, it serves as a venue for collegiate sports and other athletic competitions, contributing to the local sports scene. 5. Bennett Rink: This ice hockey rink is home to Southern Connecticut State University's club hockey team and the Amity, Woodbridge, and Bethany co-op high school team. While it is not a professional stadium, it provides an opportunity for amateur hockey players to participate in regional events, contributing to New Haven's sports legacy. In summary, while the original sentence provided historical context about New Haven's professional sports history, it did not answer the question about stadiums that continue to host minor sport leagues in modern times.

He indeed plays the piano in the movie, and the actor performed all those piano sequences himself. Gosling spent a significant amount of time learning the instrument in preparation for his role in La La Land. The film features numerous long shots of Ryan Gosling performing the piano parts, without any cuts or edits which would indicate the possible use of a double or digital enhancement. This demonstrates his abilities as an accomplished pianist. Answer 2: Yes, Ryan Gosling did learn to play the piano for his role in La La Land. Gosling trained intensively for about three months before the start of the film production. He worked with a jazz pianist to help him develop the skills necessary for him to portray the character convincingly. During this time, he would practice for up to four hours a day, and as a result, he was able to play various pieces without the use of a piano double.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Consider the perturbation hypothesis and its relation to the process of breathing and oxygen distribution. The perturbation hypothesis states that changes in weather conditions may cause less mushroom growth. Now, let's examine if this has any direct or indirect effect on the process of converting air into oxygen in the lungs. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between mushrooms and the breathing process. Mushrooms are fungi and are not directly involved in the process of breathing or oxygen distribution in the human body. Their growth is influenced by weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Step 3: Examine any possible indirect effects on the breathing process. The only possible indirect effect of less mushroom growth on the breathing process would be if it altered the atmospheric composition, specifically, the concentration of oxygen in the air. However, this scenario is highly unlikely, as mushrooms do not significantly contribute to oxygen production. Photosynthesis in plants is the primary source of oxygen production. Step 4: Determine the impact of the perturbation hypothesis on the process. After analyzing the perturbation hypothesis and its relation to breathing and oxygen distribution, it is clear that the hypothesis has no direct or indirect effect on the process. The growth of mushrooms due to changes in weather conditions is unrelated to the conversion of air into oxygen in the lungs, and the distribution of oxygen through red blood cells in the body."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Along the journey, Mandy and Benny strengthen their unlikely friendship, and Benny learns valuable lessons about selflessness, perseverance, and the power of true friendship. Mandy showcases her resourcefulness and her own growth as a character manifests through her determination to help Benny no matter the cost. After overcoming numerous obstacles and challenges, Mandy, Benny, and the washed-up wizard confront the ancient witch, Morgana. Through a relentless battle, both magical and emotional, Mandy proves to Morgana that Benny is now a changed man, worthy of redemption. Morgana, surprisingly moved by Mandy's conviction and Benny's metamorphosis, relents and agrees to break the curse. Benny returns to his human form, but not without some lingering traits from his time as a squirrel (such as an inexplicable craving for nuts). As the story concludes, Benny and Mandy embark on a new chapter, exploring the mysterious world of magic and the bond between humans and creatures, side by side."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: A new study contends having a child can mar parents' happiness more than divorce, unemployment and even the death of a partner. According to biological anthropologist Helen Fisher, having a child in today's society is often coupled with social isolation -- the main culprit behind that emotional dip. \\"You get some presents from various friends, and then they just leave you alone because they figure you're too tired and too busy,\\" Fisher said Wednesday on \\"CBS This Morning.\\" That reaction is a stark contrast to the swarm of support from friends and family in situations usually perceived to be more distressing. \\"People simply assume that when you are getting a divorce -- they're piling in to help you, they pile in to help you when you've lost your job, they really pile in to help you when you've lost your partner. But they don't pile in when you've had a child. They figure you're happy,\\" Fisher said. But according to the study published in Demography, happiness is often not the emotion many parents feel. Researchers Rachel Margolis and Mikko Myrskylä, examining how the experience of becoming a first-child parent affects the likelihood of having additional children, found that 73 percent of participants expressed decreased happiness after their first child, compared to 27 percent who reported no change or an increase in happiness. Margolis and Myrskylä examined data of 2,301 German parents from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study between 1984 to 2010. They found respondents who had a second child -- and thus reported higher life satisfaction during their transition to parenthood -- were more likely to have had their first child at a younger age, to have been partnered when their first child was conceived and to have been immigrants. That third data point could be key to further understanding why having a first child in a modernized culture can unfavorably affect parents' emotions. Fisher pointed out that today's society is experiencing a momentous shift away from our instinctual needs. \\"We used to live in large communities, and our allegiance was to God and to community and larger family. Now it's to one person, and when one that system begins to break down with the exhaustion, etc., then you're losing almost everything,\\" she said. Perhaps those immigrants who continued to have children adhere to more community-oriented customs and thus don't experience the depression, domestic isolation or breakdown in relationships as reported by other parents. The study also found women were more likely to have experienced a difficult transition into parenthood. \\"I jog in Central Park in the mornings, and I see these groups of mothers with their little baby carriages with tiny babies in it, and they're building that local community that the human animal needs, but they will all go home alone; they will all spend the rest of the day pretty much by themselves,\\" Fisher said. ||||| A standing puzzle in demography is why fertility in many developed countries is so far below replacement level. Recent answers focus on fecundity impairments brought on by postponement of fertility, the high opportunity cost of childbearing, and partnership dissolution (Bongaarts 2001; Morgan and Rackin 2010; Quesnel-Vallée and Morgan 2003). From the purely demographic perspective, progression to parity 2 is critical because differences in fertility across developed countries are largely driven by differences in the probability of having a second child (Van Bavel and Różańska-Putek 2010). Our analysis addresses the crucial question of why those who have one do not go on to have another. We highlight how parents’ experience of a first birth shapes whether they go on to have another child. Analyzing data from Germany, a country that has had period total fertility rate below 1.5 since 1983, we find that people whose subjective well-being drops after the birth of a child are less likely to have another child than those whose subjective well-being stays at the pre-birth level. The experience during transition to parenthood is an important and understudied factor in determining completed family size. Policy-makers concerned about low fertility should pay attention to factors that influence the well-being of new parents and that might inhibit further parity progression. Fertility research can benefit from incorporating an element of learning about parenthood. Prior research has used the macro perspective to analyze how childbearing spreads within a population (Myrskylä and Goldstein 2013); our analysis focuses on learning at the individual level. Before having children, potential parents do not know firsthand what is involved with parenting or how it will be for them. Prior research has postulated the potential importance of the psychosocial experience of parenting in fertility behavior (Newman 2008; Presser 2001). We show that the size of the drop in well-being around a first birth varies greatly; furthermore, this drop has important repercussions for completed family size, net of other factors, such as age at first birth, family resources, and partnership status. Progression to second birth within five years was 0.6 for those with no drop in well-being at first birth compared with 0.5 for those with a large drop, net of other factors. Subjective well-being changes after a first birth may also be important for the TFR. We used parity progression rates for the 1959 birth cohort in Germany (Kreyenfeld 2002) to simulate how much the TFR would increase if those who experienced a drop in subjective well-being after the first birth, and consequently decreased parity progression, would have had the same progression to parity 2 as those who did not experience a drop in subjective well-being. The resulting increase in national-level TFR would be 0.05 children. In the German context, with TFR hovering below 1.4, this is an important change and similar in size to the effects of the recent recession on fertility (Goldstein et al. 2013). How relevant are these findings for other low-fertility countries? In part, this depends on the size of the childless population, which dictates the proportion of the population at risk of the transition from parity 1 to 2. Childlessness among German women increased from 11 % of the 1935–1939 birth cohort to 22 % for the 1965–1969 birth cohort, the latest for which childlessness can be calculated without forecasting (Kreyenfeld and Konietzka forthcoming).4 Thus, approximately four-fifths of the German population will be represented by our data. This number would likely be higher in most other European countries, where the contribution of childlessness to low fertility is much lower than in Germany (Billari and Kohler 2004; Sobotka 2004, 2008). A second demographic component, which dictates how relevant this research is for other contexts, is the second birth rate. The proportion of mothers in Germany with two or more children declined from 75 % for the 1935–1939 birth cohort to 68 % for the 1965–1969 birth cohort. Relative to other European countries, second birth rates for Germany are slightly below the median. Thus, from a demographic perspective, the importance of subjective well-being in determining progression from parity 1 to 2 would be even greater in many countries than the one studied here, which has lower proportions of childless people and lower second birth rates. From a conceptual perspective, we cannot say whether subjective well-being around the transition to parenthood will be as strong a predictor of having a second child in other contexts. However, earlier qualitative research on this topic focused on different populations (e.g., U.S. in Presser 2001; Australia in Newman 2008) and came to the same conclusions as this article. Although the well-being of parents is important for the progression to a second birth, the determinants of progression to other birth orders are likely to be different, and different analysis strategies are needed to understand them (Bloom and Trussell 1984; Keizer et al. 2008; Kreyenfeld 2004; Mencarini and Tanturri 2007). In testing for heterogeneous effects of the transition to parenthood on fertility behavior, we found that the drop in well-being around the transition to parenthood was a stronger predictor of not having a second birth for highly educated parents and those who waited longer to have a first child. We propose four possible reasons for this finding. First, highly educated parents may not enjoy the mundane tasks of parenting (Newman 2008; Presser 2001). High-SES parents may be in careers that strongly discourage childbearing (Morgan and Rackin 2010), and these parents who have a difficult transition to parenthood feel that they cannot be successful at work and have another child. Third, having a child may disproportionately increase stress of high-SES workers because of higher demands of work while at home (Schieman et al. 2006), leading to a lower likelihood of parity progression. Last, high-SES parents who learn that parenting is harder than they expected may be more prone to revise their fertility intentions downward. Alternatively, even if there were no differences in how fertility intentions are revised, high-SES parents may be better at meeting their lower fertility preferences with contraceptives than their low-SES counterparts (Ranjit et al. 2001). It is possible that the factors influencing fertility of these subpopulations are particularly important for future fertility prospects because fertility is being postponed to increasingly higher ages—for example, mean age at first birth is already above 30 in Germany (OECD 2012)—and overall educational attainment is increasing. This analysis has limitations. First, our analysis describes the predictors and consequences of changes in overall life satisfaction for parity progression, but it cannot speak to the underlying mechanisms that determine parents’ difficulty with the transition to parenthood. These factors, such as the ease of the birth experience, level of exhaustion during the first year, and relationship stress, are not available in our survey data and are better suited to qualitative work, such as that by Newman (2008). Therefore, this research should be read alongside qualitative work. Another potential mechanism is related to “time running out.” Older parents may be influenced particularly strongly by the arrival of the first child and the experiences and responsibilities surrounding that birth because they may be aware and concerned about getting closer to the end of their reproductive age span. We are not able to examine this possibility because of data limitations. Moreover, our data do not include information on fertility desires or intentions, so we cannot analyze this. Second, we are not able to capture fertility aspirations or intention status of births in our data. Therefore, we do not know whether the drop in well-being around the first birth and the subsequent lower probability of having a second child is due to lower fertility intentions or a less positive attitude toward childbearing in the first place or whether new parents are revising their fertility intentions. However, it is also a strength to focus on transition to second birth rather than on fertility intentions or desires because it is ultimately the reproductive behavior, not intentions, that directly shape population dynamics. Nevertheless, future research on work–family conflict, planning status of births, and instrumental support would be useful to further our understanding of the specific mechanisms underlying changes in well-being around the transition to parenthood. Third, our analysis is based on annual data that do not allow analyzing changes in subjective well-being within the years before and after a birth. Prior research indicates that the risk of perinatal and postnatal depression may vary in the years before and after the birth (Banti et al. 2010), suggesting that a more nuanced analyses of the within-year changes might provide further insights into how changes in subjective well-being around the birth influence future fertility. Fourth, our measure of parental well-being is based on a distal measure of positive well-being. We capture other important factors that also matter in this analysis, but we cannot wholly exclude unmeasured factors that also contribute to changes in well-being other than having a child. Last, we examine whether the importance of changes in subjective well-being around the first birth for parity progression vary by three key demographic characteristics—sex, age, and education—but we do not analyze other potential factors. Many other factors may also be important determinants of the well-being pattern—for example, sibship size or birth order (because having had younger siblings may help anticipate the challenges of parenthood), and access to affordable childcare. Analyzing the factors determining the pattern of changes in well-being around first birth is beyond the scope of this study, but some of these factors have been analyzed in other research (Myrskylä and Margolis 2014). However, given the importance of well-being trajectories, it would be important in future studies to analyze the factors that influence the well-being trajectory around the transition to parenthood. Despite these limitations, this article presents evidence that parents’ subjective experience of a first birth is an important and understudied factor in determining final family size. An immediate follow-up question stemming from our results is whether policy could influence the subjective well-being of new parents. In 2007, Germany implemented several new policies that were aimed at supporting new parents, and preliminary evidence suggests that these policies may have positively influenced parental well-being (Myrskylä and Margolis 2013). Further research on low fertility should address the ways in which parenting experiences throughout the life course affect fertility behavior upward or downward. After all, having children is a choice in most contexts, and adults can revise their plans as they learn firsthand about what being a parent is like. ||||| Life has its ups and downs, but parenthood is supposed to be among the most joyous. At least that's what the movies and Target ads tell us. In reality, it turns out that having a child can have a pretty strong negative impact on a person's happiness, according to a new study published in the journal Demography. In fact, on average, the effect of a new baby on a person's life in the first year is devastatingly bad — worse than divorce, worse than unemployment and worse even than the death of a partner. Researchers Rachel Margolis and Mikko Myrskylä followed 2,016 Germans who were childless at the time the study began until at least two years after the birth of their first child. Respondents were asked to rate their happiness from 0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied) in response to the question, \\"How satisfied are you with your life, all things considered?\\" [Maternal exposure to anti-depressant SSRIs linked to autism in children] \\"Although this measure does not capture respondents' overall experience of having a child, it is preferable to direct questions about childbearing because it is considered taboo for new parents to say negative things about a new child,\\" they wrote. The study's goal was to try to gain insights into a longstanding contradiction in fertility in many developed countries between how many children people say they want and how many they actually have. In Germany, most couples say in surveys that they want two children. Yet the birthrate in the country has remained stubbornly low — 1.5 children per woman — for 40 years. Margolis, a sociology researcher at the University of Western Ontario, and Myrskylä, director of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, found that most couples in their study started out pretty happy when they set out to have their first child. In the year prior to the birth, their life satisfaction ticked up even more, perhaps due to the pregnancy and anticipation of the baby. [Anti-vax mom changes her tune as all 7 of her children come down with whooping cough] It was only after birth that the parents' experiences diverged. About 30 percent remained at about the same state of happiness or better once they had the baby, according to self-reported measures of well-being. The rest said their happiness decreased during the first and second year after the birth. Of those new mothers and fathers whose happiness went down, 37 percent (742) reported a one-unit drop, 19 percent (383) a two-unit drop and 17 percent (341) a three-unit drop. [How parents create narcissistic children] On average, new parenthood led to a 1.4 unit drop in happiness. That's considered very severe. To put things in perspective, previous studies have quantified the impact of other major life events on the same happiness scale in this way: divorce, the equivalent of a 0.6 \\"happiness unit\\" drop; unemployment, a one-unit drop; and the death of a partner a one-unit drop. The consequence of the negative experiences was that many of the parents stopped having children after their first. The data showed the larger the loss in well-being, the lower the likelihood of a second baby. The effect was especially strong in mothers and fathers who are older than age 30 and with higher education. Surprisingly, gender was not a factor. [95 percent of parents think their overweight children are ‘just right’] \\"Fertility is a choice for most people in the developed world … [I]f the transition to parenthood is very difficult or more difficult than expected, then people may choose to remain at parity,\\" the researchers wrote. Margolis and Myrskyla wrote that challenges of new parents that impacted their decision to have another fell into three categories. The first two had to do with health. Mothers reported physical pain and nausea conflicted with their desire to work. Fathers expressed concern about the medical issues of their partner. Second, complications during the birth also appeared to shape their decision to not \\"go through it again.\\" The third category was the most significant and was about \\"the continuous and intense nature of childrearing.\\" Parents reported exhaustion due to trouble breast-feeding, sleep deprivation, depression, domestic isolation and relationship breakdown. The findings are likely to be eye-opening for some policymakers who are concerned about low fertility rates in their countries and suggest that governments should consider giving additional support to new parents.

Information: - Spirogyra (common names include water silk, mermaid's tresses, and blanket weed) is a genus of filamentous charophyte green algae of the order Zygnematales, named for the helical or spiral arrangement of the chloroplasts that is diagnostic of the genus. It is commonly found in freshwater areas, and there are more than 400 species of \\"Spirogyra\\" in the world. \\"Spirogyra\\" measures approximately 10 to 100 m in width and may grow to several centimeters in length. - In vascular plants, phloem is the living tissue that transports the soluble organic compounds made during photosynthesis (known as photosynthate), in particular the sugar sucrose, to all parts of the plant where needed. This transport process is called translocation. In trees, the phloem is the innermost layer of the bark, hence the name, derived from the Greek word (\\"phloios\\") meaning \\"bark\\". - Chlamydomonas is a genus of green algae consisting of unicellular flagellates, found in stagnant water and on damp soil, in freshwater, seawater, and even in snow as \\"snow algae\\" \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is used as a model organism for molecular biology, especially studies of flagellar motility and chloroplast dynamics, biogeneses, and genetics. One of the many striking features of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is that it contains ion channels, (channelrhodopsins), that are directly activated by light. Some regulatory systems of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" are more complex than their homologs in Gymnosperms, with evolutionarily related regulatory proteins being larger and containing additional domains. - In taxonomy, the Volvocales, also known as Chlamydomonadales, are an order of flagellate or pseudociliate green algae, specifically of the Chlorophyceae. Volvocales can form planar or spherical colonies. These vary from \\"Gonium\\" (4 to 32 cells) up to \\"Volvox\\" (500 cells or more). Each cell has two flagella, and is similar in appearance to \\"Chlamydomonas\\", with the flagella throughout the colony moving in coordination. - Kelps are large seaweeds (algae) belonging to the brown algae (Phaeophyceae) in the order Laminariales. There are about 30 different genera. - Gonium is a genus of colonial algae , a member of the order Volvocales . Typical colonies have 4 to 16 cells , all the same size , arranged in a flat plate , with no anterior - posterior differentiation . In a colony of 16 cells , four are in the center , and the other 12 are on the four sides , three each . A description by G.M. Smith ( 1920 , p. 94 ) : Gonium Mueller 1773 : Colonies of 4 - 8 - 16 cells arranged in a flat quadrangular plate and embedded in a common gelatinous matrix or connected by broad gelatinous strands . Cells ovoid to pyriform , with a single cup - shaped chloroplast containing one pyrenoid . Each cell with two cilia of equal length , contractile vacuoles at the base of the cilia , and an eyespot . Four - and eight - celled colonies with the cilia on the same side ; sixteencelled colonies with the four central cells having their cilia on the same side and the twelve marginal cells with radially arranged cilia . Asexual reproduction by simultaneous division of all cells in the colony to form autocolonies , or by a formation of 2 - 4 zoospores in each cell . - A flagellate is a cell or organism with one or more whip-like organelles called flagella. The word \\"flagellate\\" also describes a particular construction (or level of organization) characteristic of many protists (eukaryotic organisms) and their means of motion. The term presently does not imply any specific relationship or classification of the organisms that possess flagellae. However, the term \\"flagellate\\" is included in other terms (such as \\"dinoflagellate\\" and \\"choanoflagellata\\") which are more formally characterized. - The Chlorophyceae are one of the classes of green algae, distinguished mainly on the basis of ultrastructural morphology. For example, the chlorophycean CW clade, and chlorophycean DO clade, are defined by the arrangement of their flagella. Members of the CW clade have flagella that are displaced in a \\"clockwise\\" (CW, 17 o'clock) direction e.g. Chlamydomonadales. Members of the DO clade have flagella that are \\"directly opposed\\" (DO, 126 o'clock) e.g. Sphaeropleales. They are usually green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. The chloroplast may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplast. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made up of an inner layer of cellulose and outer layer of pectose. - Chlorella is a genus of single-cell green algae belonging to the phylum Chlorophyta. It is spherical in shape, about 2 to 10 m in diameter, and is without flagella. \\"Chlorella\\" contains the green photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll-a and -b in its chloroplast. Through photosynthesis, it multiplies rapidly, requiring only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to reproduce. - Charophyta is a division of freshwater green algae. The terrestrial plants, the Embryophyta emerged within Charophyta, with the class Zygnematophyceae as a sister group. In some charophyte groups, such as Zygnematophyceae or conjugating green algae, flagellae are absent and sexual reproduction does not involve free-swimming flagellate sperm. Flagellate sperm, however, are found in stoneworts (Charales) and Coleochaetales, orders of parenchymatous charophytes that are the closest relatives of the land plants, where flagellate sperm are also present in all except the conifers and flowering plants. Fossil stoneworts of Devonian age that are similar to those of the present day have been described from the Rhynie chert of Scotland. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts. - Xylem is one of the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants, phloem being the other. The basic function of xylem is to transport water from roots to shoots and leaves, but it also transports some nutrients. The word \\"xylem\\" is derived from the Greek word (\\"xylon\\"), meaning \\"wood\\"; the best-known xylem tissue is wood, though it is found throughout the plant. - Volvox is a polyphyletic genus of chlorophyte green algae in the family Volvocaceae. It forms spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells. They live in a variety of freshwater habitats, and were first reported by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1700. \\"Volvox\\" diverged from unicellular ancestors approximately . What is the relationship between 'gonium' and 'volvocaceae'?","completion":"The relationship between Gonium and Volvocaceae is that Gonium is a genus of colonial green algae, and it belongs to the family Volvocaceae. The Volvocaceae family is a group of green algae that form colonies of different sizes and complexities. Both Gonium and Volvox, another genus in the Volvocaceae family, share similarities in their colonial structure and flagella arrangement. Gonium typically forms colonies of 4 to 16 cells arranged in a flat plate without anterior-posterior differentiation. Each cell in a Gonium colony is similar in size and shape and possesses two flagella, which move in coordination throughout the colony. On the other hand, Volvox forms spherical colonies consisting of up to 50,000 cells. Despite the differences in colony size and shape, the cells of both Gonium and Volvox have two flagella, allowing them to move and function as a coordinated unit. In summary, Gonium and Volvocaceae are related because Gonium is a genus within the Volvocaceae family, which also includes the Volvox genus. Both genera are known for their colonial organization and coordinated flagella movement among their cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:- Air is drawn in through the mouth - The air goes down the esophagus - The air moves into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is removed - The remaining oxygen enters the body What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step of the process after the remaining oxygen enters the body is the distribution and utilization of the oxygen by the body's cells for various metabolic processes. Here is a detailed explanation of this final step: 6. Oxygen transportation to body cells: As the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs flows into the pulmonary veins and returns to the heart, the left atrium receives it and then transfers it into the left ventricle through the bicuspid or mitral valve. The left ventricle then contracts, pumping the oxygenated blood into the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. The aorta further branches into several smaller arteries, arterioles, and eventually, capillaries, which reach all parts of the body, including muscles, organs, and tissues. 7. Oxygen exchange in the capillaries: The oxygen carried in the blood by hemoglobin molecules in the red blood cells (RBCs) is diffused across the thin walls of the capillaries and into the body's cells. This process occurs due to a concentration gradient, where the area with higher oxygen concentration (oxygenated blood in the capillaries) moves to an area with lower oxygen concentration (body cells). The oxygen transported is then used by the cells for various metabolic processes, including cellular respiration, which generates the energy necessary for crucial cellular functions. 8. Carbon dioxide formation and transportation: During cellular respiration, waste products are formed, including carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a by-product of the cells converting oxygen and nutrients into energy (adenosine triphosphate or ATP). The CO2 produced in the cells then diffuses back into the capillaries due to another concentration gradient, where the area with higher CO2 concentration (body cells) moves to an area with lower CO2 concentration (deoxygenated blood in the capillaries). This deoxygenated blood consisting of CO2 is then carried by the capillaries back into the veins, which merge into larger veins, ultimately leading to the inferior and superior vena cava. 9. Carbon dioxide elimination: The deoxygenated blood carrying CO2 flows through the superior and inferior vena cava into the right atrium of the heart. It is then pumped into the right ventricle and sent via the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where the process of oxygenation began. In the lungs, CO2 diffuses from the blood into the alveoli, where it is expelled through exhalation. This completes the cycle of air intake, oxygen distribution and utilization, and carbon dioxide removal in the human respiratory system, ensuring the cells continue receiving the oxygen they need to function optimally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Passage: Monday marked the beginning of organised action, even as order broke down in the streets, especially at the gates, and the fire raged unchecked. Bloodworth was responsible as Lord Mayor for co-ordinating the fire-fighting, but he had apparently left the City; his name is not mentioned in any contemporaneous accounts of the Monday's events. In this state of emergency, the King again overrode the City authorities and put his brother James, Duke of York, in charge of operations. James set up command posts round the perimeter of the fire, press-ganging into teams of well-paid and well-fed firemen any men of the lower classes found in the streets. Three courtiers were put in charge of each post, with authority from Charles himself to order demolitions. This visible gesture of solidarity from the Crown was intended to cut through the citizens' misgivings about being held financially responsible for pulling down houses. James and his life guards rode up and down the streets all Monday, rescuing foreigners from the mob and attempting to keep order. \\"The Duke of York hath won the hearts of the people with his continual and indefatigable pains day and night in helping to quench the Fire,\\" wrote a witness in a letter on 8 September.On Monday evening, hopes were dashed that the massive stone walls of Baynard's Castle, Blackfriars would stay the course of the flames, the western counterpart of the Tower of London. This historic royal palace was completely consumed, burning all night.A contemporary account said that King Charles in person worked manually, that day or later, to help throw water on flames and to help demolish buildings to make a firebreak.

After a Frustrating Season, Dubinsky Is Ready for a New Chapter GREENBURGH, N.Y.— Forward Brandon Dubinsky used the word nightmare here Monday to describe his part of the regular season just past. It was part of a remarkable self-analysis that Dubinsky conducted for reporters after the Rangers’ first practice ahead of Thursday’s playoff opener against Ottawa. “You have expectations for yourself,” Dubinsky said. “When you don’t meet those expectations, it weighs and it kind of builds — it continues to build and build and build. It’s tough. But this is a great opportunity for me, and it’s a clean slate.” His feeling is understandable. Coming off a 2010-11 campaign in which he scored a team-high 24 goals and 54 points, this season he notched only 10 goals and 34 points. But worse was the sheer visibility of his struggles. After starting the season on the second line, he dropped down to the third and occasionally even the fourth line. In February his name repeatedly came up as the one player the Rangers would be willing to trade away to get Columbus’s Rick Nash. “It always seems to be me,” Dubinsky said the day before the deadline, commenting on the frequency of the rumors of his departure. After the deadline he was often called out for taking bad penalties by Coach John Tortorella, who in March said he would have scratched Dubinsky if other forwards had not been injured. “We need Duby, but I’m not going to watch the same mistakes all the time,” Tortorella said. It is true that Dubinsky’s scoring fell off in 2011-12, but he was actually quite good in other areas. His plus-16 mark was the fourth highest on the team, and he recorded it while logging a fair amount of ice time against the opponent’s top six forwards. And certainly no one questioned his willingness to be physical; he was fourth on the team in hits, and he fought six times on a team that led the league in fighting. Nevertheless, Dubinsky was disappointed with his regular-season performance and looking forward to a fresh start in the playoffs, where, he said, everyone’s stats are “all zeroes,” and “right now I’m tied for first” in scoring. “In all reality it’s been a nightmare of a year for me,” Dubinsky said. “But that being said, the guys around me have picked me up and have played well enough to put us in a great position to have home-ice advantage. That gives me a little extra motivation to come out and make an impact.” Dubinsky said he knew how he could do that. “I think for me the playoffs are kind of tailored toward the way I play,” he said. “They’re hard, they’re physical, they’re gritty. The goals aren’t pretty like they are during the regular season — they’re ugly. There’s no small plays, so you’ve got to be responsible. I feel like I’m a pretty responsible player out there. “But more important, it’s important for me to understand the opportunity that I have and understand how big this is for the team. Hopefully I can rise to the occasion.” Tortorella said he saw improvement in Dubinsky’s game over the last 10 games or so, but his analysis was not entirely kind to the fifth-year forward. “Again, his game isn’t dead-on, but he’s beginning to show signs,” Tortorella said. “But now I think a lot of people wipe it clean now, whether it be a good or a bad year, because this is a new beginning. Especially for a young guy that’s had a struggle this year. I think it’s a real good mind-set change for him. I know he’s preparing to do that. “This is an important time for him, because Dubie cares. I think he really wants to try to help the team. He’s a type of player in the playoffs that can get us to the next level.” Dubinsky described the process he is trying to use to get out of the emotional rut. “It’s frustration when you don’t play your best because you’re not prepared, or you’re not into it or whatever that is,” Dubinsky said. “But you can’t be frustrated when you do everything you can in order to be successful. I think that’s the biggest thing.” He continued to give what amounted to a pep talk to himself. “And if you do all the little things that make yourself successful – for me, it’s being physical and moving my feet and being in the right places — success kind of follows,” he said. “You don’t necessarily think of the end goal, you just think of the process to get to the end goal.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"After a frustrating regular season, New York Rangers forward Brandon Dubinsky is looking forward to a fresh start in the playoffs. Despite a drop in his scoring, Dubinsky exhibited strong performance in other areas of his game, such as maintaining a plus-16 mark and demonstrating willingness to be physical on the ice. Coach John Tortorella noted signs of improvement in Dubinsky's game in the final stretch of the regular season and emphasized the importance of the playoffs as a new beginning for the young player. Dubinsky plans to focus on doing all the little things that contribute to success as he prepares for the playoffs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is named after the lead seal (\\"bulla\\") that was traditionally appended to the end in order to authenticate it. - The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem was a crusader state established in the Southern Levant in 1099 after the First Crusade. The kingdom lasted nearly two hundred years, from 1099 until 1291 when the last remaining possession, Acre, was destroyed by the Mamluks, but its history is divided into two distinct periods. The sometimes so-called First Kingdom of Jerusalem lasted from 1099 to 1187, when it was almost entirely overrun by Saladin. After the subsequent Third Crusade, the kingdom was re-established in Acre in 1192, and lasted until that city's destruction in 1291. This second kingdom is sometimes called the Second Kingdom of Jerusalem or the Kingdom of Acre, after its new capital. - An-Nasir Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (/ ALA-LC: \\"al ad-Dn Ysuf ibn Ayyb\\"; / ALC-LC: \\"Selahedînê Eyûbî\\"), known as Saladin (1137 4 March 1193), was the first sultan of Egypt and Syria and the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. A Sunni Muslim of Kurdish origin, Saladin led the Muslim military campaign against the Crusader states in the Levant. At the height of his power, his sultanate included Egypt, Syria, Upper Mesopotamia, the Hejaz, Yemen and other parts of North Africa. - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God. - The Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem was a Roman Catholic military order founded by crusaders around 1119 at a leper hospital in Jerusalem , Kingdom of Jerusalem , whose care became its original purpose , named after patron saint Lazarus . It was recognised by King Fulk of Jerusalem in 1142 and canonically recognised as hospitaller and military order of chivalry under the rule of Saint Augustine in the Papal bull Cum a Nobis Petitur of Pope Alexander IV in 1255 . The titular seat was successively situated at Jerusalem , Saint - Jean - d'Acre and - after the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem - the Château Royal de Boigny - sur - Bionne in France . After several centuries , the order went into decline and ceased to perform its original functions after the French Revolution . In 1489 , Pope Innocent VIII attempted to merge the order and its land holdings with the Sovereign Military Order of Malta . This was resisted by the order in most countries where it still retained its premises . In 1572 , the Order of Saint Lazarus in Italy was merged with the Order of Saint Maurice under the Royal House of Savoy to form the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus , which still exists until today . In 1609 , King Henry IV of France linked it administratively to the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel to form the Royal Military and Hospitaller Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem united , which remained listed as of royal protection in the French Royal Almanac until 1830 . Its last living member admitted before the turmoil of the French Revolution died in 1856 . Notwithstanding , the revived Order of Saint Lazarus ( statuted 1910 ) claims legacy from the suppressed French branch under spiritual protection of the Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church , disputed by officials of the Roman Catholic Church . - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world. - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. - The First Crusade (10951099) was the first of a number of crusades that attempted to capture the Holy Land, called by Pope Urban II in 1095. It started as a widespread pilgrimage in western Christendom and ended as a military expedition by Roman Catholic Europe to regain the Holy Land taken in the Muslim conquests of the Levant (632661), ultimately resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Abrahamic religions, emphasizing and tracing their common origin to the tribal patriarch Abraham or recognizing a spiritual tradition identified with him, are one of the major divisions in comparative religion (along with Indian, Iranian, and East Asian religions).

Question 2: It's like setting up the same toy cars race, but this time, you have different paths with different numbers of narrow parts, or resistances. You still add all the 'slow downs' together, but you might need to combine them in a special way. If the paths are all in a row (series), just add them up. If paths are side by side (parallel), you use a special trick: 1/total_slow_down = 1/slow_down1 + 1/slow_down2 +...

Bomb plots targeting the New York Stock Exchange and the city's subway were among more than 50 terrorist acts worldwide thwarted by top-secret surveillance programs since the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the United States, security officials said Tuesday. The startling details disclosed at a House intelligence committee hearing reflected a unified effort by the Obama administration and legislators to defend the telephone and e-mail surveillance made public this month by classified leaks to newspapers. Testimony by Gen. Keith Alexander, the National Security Agency director, as well as officials from the FBI, Department of Justice and the Director of National Intelligence office called the programs created under the Patriot Act in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks a vital tool against terrorist plots. Joined by panel Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers and other legislators, they condemned the document leaks by former government contractor Edward Snowden as harmful to the United States and its allies. The leaks also led to what officials called widespread public misinformation about the surveillance programs that necessitated the relatively rare open hearing by the intelligence panel, where they detailed previously classified information in order to set the record straight. It was the most comprehensive and specific defense of the surveillance methods that have come under ferocious criticism from civil liberties groups, some members of Congress and others concerned about the reach of government into the private lives of citizens. National security and law enforcement officials repeated that the programs are tightly run with significant regulation and oversight by federal judges and Congress. Addressing the most basic questions that have emerged, Rogers asked Alexander if intelligence workers have the ability to simply \\"flip a switch\\" in order to listen to phone calls or read the emails of Americans. When Alexander replied \\"no,\\" Rogers asked again to reinforce the message for anyone listening. \\"So the technology does not exist for any individual or group of individuals at the NSA to flip a switch to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their e-mails?\\" he repeated. \\"That is correct,\\" Alexander answered. He and others also asserted that the leaks were egregious and carry huge consequences for national security. \\"I think it was irreversible and significant damage to this nation,\\" Alexander said when questioned by Rep. Michele Bachmann. \\"Has this helped America's enemies?\\" the conservative Minnesota Republican asked. \\"I believe it has and I believe it will hurt us and our allies,\\" Alexander said. President Barack Obama has defended the programs as necessary in an era of terror. In an interview with PBS' Charlie Rose broadcast on Monday night, Obama said the situation requires a national debate on the balance between security and privacy. Obama bristles at suggestion he's shifted on snooping. Alexander told a Senate committee last week that the surveillance programs helped stop dozens of terror plots, but he was unable then to provide classified details. Under pressure from Rogers and other legislators, Alexander joined law enforcement officials Tuesday in making public some declassified details of the Patriot Act provisions. In recent years, Alexander said, information \\"gathered from these programs provided government with critical leads to prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world.\\" Details of most of the thwarted terrorism acts remain secret, but national security officials said they were working on declassifying more information and could have a report to Congress as early as this week. Sean Joyce, the deputy FBI director, detailed how email surveillance of foreigners under one program helped authorities discover the two New York City plots. In the fall of 2009, Joyce said, the NSA intercepted an e-mail from a suspected terrorist in Pakistan. That person was talking with someone in the United States \\"about perfecting a recipe for explosives,\\" he said. Authorities identified Afghan-born Najibullah Zazi of Denver. The FBI followed him to New York and eventually broke up planning to attack the city's subway system. Zazi pleaded guilty and is currently in prison. Snowden claims online Obama expanded 'abusive' security. In the other New York case, the NSA was monitoring a \\"known extremist\\" in Yemen who was in contact with a person in the United States, Joyce said. The FBI detected \\"nascent plotting\\" to bomb the stock exchange, long considered a target of terrorists, and the plotters were later convicted, according to Joyce. He also said e-mail surveillance disrupted an effort to attack the office of a Danish newspaper that was threatened for publishing a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed in 2006. The plot involved David Headley, a U.S citizen living in Chicago. The FBI received intelligence at the time regarding his possible involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack that killed 164 people, Joyce said. The NSA, through surveillance of an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist, found that Headley was working on a plot to bomb the newspaper. Headley later confessed to conducting surveillance and was convicted. He also pleaded guilty to conducting surveillance in the Mumbai case. In a fourth case, secret surveillance \\"tipped us off\\" to a person who had indirect contacts with a known terrorist group overseas, Joyce said. \\"We were able to reopen this investigation, identify additional individuals through the legal process and were able to disrupt this terrorist activity,\\" Joyce said. In an exchange with Joyce, Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas said the case involved someone financing a designated terrorist group in Somalia. Rogers, who scheduled the hearing in recent days after Alexander pledged to declassify information on terror plots thwarted by the secret programs, said it was necessary to clear up public confusion caused by misinformation. \\"If half the things I read in blog and other places were true, I wouldn't support it,\\" the Michigan Republican said, later adding that skeptics \\"have no understanding\\" of what is going on. In particular, he said Snowden disclosed only a sliver of information about the programs without knowing the full extent of what they did and the strict regulation and oversight of them. \\"None of the things he talked about were accurate,\\" Rogers said of Snowden. The hearing came one day after Snowden defended his actions in leaking classified documents to Britain's Guardian newpaper and the Washington Post. In a series of blog posts on the Guardian website, the 29-year-old Snowden said he disclosed the information because Obama worsened \\"abusive\\" surveillance practices instead of curtailing them as he promised as a presidential candidate. The former NSA contractor insisted that U.S. authorities have access to phone calls, e-mails and other communications far beyond constitutional bounds. While he said legal restrictions can be easily skirted by analysts at the NSA, FBI and CIA, Snowden stopped short of accusing authorities of violating specific laws. Instead, he said toothless regulations and policies were to blame for what he called \\"suspicionless surveillance,\\" and he warned that policies can be changed to allow further abuses. At Tuesday's hearing, officials detailed how the programs operate and the judicial and legislative oversight involved, repeating several times how access to the content of e-mails or telephone calls -- or even the names of people involved -- required authorization. Deputy Attorney General James Cole noted that basic phone records collected under Section 215 of the Patriot Act were not protected by Fourth Amendment rights to privacy, citing a 1979 Supreme Court ruling. In the case, Smith v. Maryland, the justices ruled that information about telephone calls -- such as their time and duration -- was different from the content of the calls and therefore not protected under the Fourth Amendment. Cole also provided a detailed description of the legal framework of the programs, noting that the anti-terrorism surveillance effort is not \\"off the books\\" or \\"hidden away.\\" \\"This is part of what government puts together and discusses,\\" he said. \\"Statutes are passed. It is overseen by three branches of our government -- the Legislature, the Judiciary, and the Executive Branch.\\" He described the U.S. phone records collected under Section 215 as basic information \\"just like what you would get in your own phone bill.\\" \\"It is the number that was dialed from, the number that was dialed to, the date and the length of time. That's all we get,\\" he said. \\"We do not get the identity of any of the parties to this phone call. We don't get any cell site or location information as to where any of these phones were located. And, most importantly, and you're probably going to hear this about 100 times today, we don't get any content under this. We don't listen in on anybody's calls under this program at all.\\" Tech companies jockey to seem the most transparent. Instead, it takes permission from a special court to get access to further information, based on a verifiable link to a terrorism investigation, Cole explained. Such links have mostly come from another surveillance program that collects communications information of foreign terrorism suspects living overseas. Critics question the need to store the vast amount of U.S. phone records, saying it creates a database prone to abuses and provides little return for the risk and privacy concerns. Alexander said Tuesday the phone database played a role in stopping 10 terrorist acts since the 9/11 attacks. At the same time, he and other officials said there were no cases they knew of in which anyone willfully misused the system to access information. \\"If you're looking for the needle in a haystack,\\" Cole said, \\"you have to have the haystack.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article talks about how secret surveillance programs helped prevent more than 50 terrorist acts around the world after the 2001 al Qaeda attacks. Some of these prevented attacks included bomb plots targeting the New York Stock Exchange and the city's subway.

During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: \\"For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music.\\"In line with the Hindu yoga tradition, Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s. After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda – yogis and authors, respectively, of Raja Yoga and Autobiography of a Yogi. In mid-1969, he produced the single \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\", performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple. Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain, Harrison then met their leader, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whom he described as \\"my friend ... my master\\" and \\"a perfect example of everything he preached\\".

Answer:","completion":"The Admiral's Men, also known as the \\"Earl of Nottingham's Men\\" after their patron Charles Howard, Earl of Nottingham, was a prominent and influential acting company during the English Renaissance period. They had a significant impact on the development and growth of English theatre, performing professional dramas for the entertainment of both public and court audiences, spanning from the late 16th century to the early 17th century. The main occupation of The Admiral's Men was that of actors, stage performers, and theatre professionals who entertained the public by presenting plays and other theatrical productions. In addition to actors, the company would also consist of playwrights, technicians, stagehands, and managers to organize and facilitate the performances. Members of the company were responsible for developing and presenting new works, as well as reviving and reinterpreting classic plays from previous generations. As one of the leading acting companies of the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, The Admiral's Men contributed immensely to the artistic and cultural growth of English theatre. They performed at various playhouses around London, including The Theatre, The Rose, and the Fortune Theatre. Their work as theatre professionals included outdoor performances at amphitheatres, indoor performances at court, and private performances across the country for aristocracy and gentry. The Admiral's Men were known for their close collaboration with some of the most talented playwrights and other theatre practitioners of the era. This includes renowned dramatist and playwright Christopher Marlowe, who penned popular plays like \\"Doctor Faustus,\\" \\"Tamburlaine the Great,\\" and \\"The Jew of Malta.\\" In fact, The Admiral's Men premiered several plays penned by Marlowe, right up until his untimely demise in 1593. After Marlowe's passing, they continued to work with other notable playwrights, such as Robert Greene, Thomas Nashe, and later on, Thomas Heywood. Another remarkable aspect of their occupation was the fostering of managerial and organizational developments within the theatre industry. The Admiral's Men were pioneers in establishing permanent acting companies, having their own playhouses, and developing long-term relationships with playwrights. This was an innovative departure from the previous model of temporary acting troupes who would come together to stage a few plays and then disband. Apart from presenting popular entertainments, The Admiral's Men were also involved in influencing people's perception of society and politics, as many of their plays contained social and political commentary. They functioned not just as actors but as active contributors to the intellectual and cultural landscape of Renaissance England. In conclusion, the occupation of The Admiral's Men encompassed a broad range of creative and logistical roles within the English theatre industry. They were actors, stage performers, theatre professionals, and influential visionaries who shaped the landscape of theatre during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. Their work, in conjunction with that of various playwrights and theatrical collaborators, enriched the cultural fabric of English society and left an indelible mark on the history of English drama."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now came the time for a mini-device preventing the development of symptoms of psycho-motor aggression. The device was really simple. It weighed about a kilo and was the size of a bag of flour. It was to be worn on the right wrist. The fact it had to be the right wrist was very important. Otherwise, the invention didn't work properly, or even worse, it produced results opposite to its intended effect. Each day, its mini-containers had to be re-filled with substances promoting positive processes in the body leading to the return of good mood. There were three containers to re-fill, and the substances were not available on the local market and had to be imported using diplomatic channels from the USA. To operate the device, turning it on stand-by was enough. In that mode, it could be used continuously for one and a half hours. To recharge the batteries, you needed a charger, which was stored in a small suitcase. The device, when it was turned on, made a low murmur (or according to some - a loud growl) designed to keep the owner in a good mood.

With city populations growing rapidly, it has become imperative for the government to take proactive measures to ensure adequate space and resources are available for all citizens. The Malaysian government recognizes that urban congestion is detrimental to overall quality of life, as it affects transportation infrastructure, increases air pollution, and causes excessive strain on public facilities. Therefore, the decision to develop suburbs is well-founded and timely, aiming to create a more efficient and better-functioning metropolitan landscape. At the heart of this new initiative is the plan to provide a variety of housing options, along with necessary amenities like schools, hospitals, and community centers within the suburban areas. By providing these essential services, the Malaysian government hopes to encourage urban residents to consider relocating or settling in the suburbs. This will not only help to address the issue of urban overcrowding, but also foster the growth of these suburban areas, resulting in more balanced regional development. Furthermore, the development of suburbs will be complemented by efficient transit systems, ensuring seamless connectivity between urban and suburban communities. This will allow residents to enjoy the peaceful lifestyle associated with suburban living while still being able to commute efficiently to work and other activities in the urban areas. Additionally, improving transportation infrastructure should reduce traffic-related air pollution and cut down on commuting times, enhancing the overall quality of life for Malaysian citizens. The Malaysian government's decision to develop suburbs as a means of addressing urban congestion showcases a strong commitment to sustainable growth and the wellbeing of its citizens. By providing a higher quality of life, ample resources, and seamless transportation options, this initiative is expected to reduce the strain on urban centers and help the nation accommodate its growing population with ease. In conclusion, Malaysia's move to develop suburbs to ease urban congestion is a forward-thinking approach to manage its rapidly growing city populations. By addressing issues related to transportation, pollution, and overburdened urban centers, this initiative holds the potential to create a more sustainable and interconnected Malaysia that benefits everyone."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What type of details about santino ferrucci can be gathered from the following bio?

The uppercoat developes rather slowly, and can hardly be seen in kitten. Translate to German","completion":"Die obere Felllage entwickelt sich eher langsam und ist bei Kätzchen kaum zu erkennen. Here is a detailed and long answer in English, as well as the German translation: The development of the upper coat, also known as the guard hairs, in kittens is a gradual process that may be difficult to observe during the early stages of their growth. This layer of fur serves as protection against environmental factors and helps regulate the body temperature of the animal. In contrast to the soft downy undercoat, the upper coat consists of thicker, longer hairs that provide a waterproof shield. Throughout the initial weeks of a kitten's life, most of their fur consists of soft, fine hairs that make up the undercoat. These hairs provide insulation, keeping the kitten warm in colder temperatures. As the kitten matures and grows, the upper coat begins to develop. However, the subtle transition from the undercoat to the emergence of the guard hairs can be challenging to notice. The color and pattern of the coat also change as the kitten ages. In some breeds, the variations in color and markings can become more distinct and vibrant, while others may experience a slight fading as their fur comes in fully. It is not until the kitten is several months old that their final coat color can be determined with certainty. In summary, the development of the upper coat in kittens is a slow and often unnoticeable process. However, as they mature and grow their unique and protective layer of fur will gradually form, adapting to their needs and environment. German translation: Die Entwicklung des oberen Fells, auch bekannt als Deckhaare, bei Kätzchen ist ein allmählicher Prozess, der in den frühen Wachstumsphasen möglicherweise schwer zu beobachten ist. Diese Felllage dient dem Schutz vor Umwelteinflüssen und hilft bei der Regulierung der Körpertemperatur des Tieres. Im Gegensatz zum weichen, flaumigen Unterfell besteht das obere Fell aus dickeren, längeren Haaren, die einen wasserdichten Schutz bieten. Während der ersten Lebenswochen eines Kätzchens besteht der Großteil ihres Fells aus weichen, feinen Haaren, die das Unterfell bilden. Diese Haare isolieren und halten das Kätzchen in kälteren Temperaturen warm. Wenn das Kätzchen heranwächst und größer wird, beginnt sich das obere Fell zu entwickeln. Der Übergang vom Unterfell zum Erscheinen der Deckhaare kann jedoch schwer zu bemerken sein. Die Farbe und das Muster des Fells ändern sich auch, wenn das Kätzchen älter wird. Bei einigen Rassen können die Variationen in Farbe und Zeichnung deutlicher und prächtiger werden, während andere eine leichte Verblassen erfahren, wenn ihr Fell vollständig nachwächst. Erst wenn das Kätzchen mehrere Monate alt ist, kann die endgültige Fellfarbe mit Sicherheit festgestellt werden. Zusammenfassend ist die Entwicklung des oberen Fells bei Kätzchen ein langsamer und oft unbemerkter Prozess. Wenn sie jedoch heranwachsen und größer werden, wird sich ihre einzigartige und schützende Felllage allmählich bilden und sich an ihre Bedürfnisse und Umgebung anpassen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Londonderry, New Hampshire (CNN) -- A new CNN/ORC poll shows a statistical dead heat between New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and her GOP opponent Scott Brown, with Shaheen at 49%, Brown at 47%, and a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4%. Perhaps even more telling is another politician's approval rating, and he's not even in the Granite State. President Barack Obama has only a 39% approval rating in New Hampshire, the new poll shows. Fifty-seven percent of voters say they disapprove of the way he is handling his job. That's a far fall for a president who beat his Republican opponents here in the Granite State overwhelmingly in both 2008 and just two years ago in 2012. \\"This race is not between the President and","completion":"me, it's between me and Scott Brown,\\" Shaheen said in a recent interview. \\"New Hampshire voters are independent-minded, and they will make their decision based on who they believe can best represent them in the Senate.\\" Brown, on the other hand, has been trying to capitalize on the President's lack of popularity in the state, tying Shaheen to some of Obama's more controversial policies and decisions. \\"Voters are frustrated with the direction the country is headed, and they're looking for someone who can bring real change to Washington,\\" Brown commented during a campaign stop. As Election Day draws near, both campaigns are ramping up their efforts to sway undecided voters. Shaheen's campaign has focused on her record as a bipartisan senator who has consistently worked across the aisle to get things done for New Hampshire. Meanwhile, Brown has been highlighting his past experience as a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts and his commitment to be a strong advocate for the people of New Hampshire. Political analysts are closely watching the race, noting that it could have broader implications for control of the Senate. The battle for Senate majority has been hotly contested this election season, with Democrats and Republicans both vying for dominance. A win for either party in New Hampshire could tip the balance of power, making this race even more crucial. In the final days leading up to the election, both Shaheen and Brown are making their final pitches to voters, hoping that their respective messages resonate with the people of New Hampshire. With the race this close, each vote will play a pivotal role in determining the outcome and possibly the future of the U.S. Senate. As New Hampshire prepares to make its choice, the nation watches with bated breath, eagerly anticipating the results of this closely fought contest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective.

Movie title: Apollo 18 Context: In December 1974, the crew of the cancelled Apollo 18 mission is informed that it will now proceed as a top secret Department of Defense (DoD) mission disguised as a satellite launch. Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR. Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom command module while Walker and Anderson land on the moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take moon rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission. The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and non-human tracks that Walker cites as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walker's chest; Anderson removes a moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source.

Arundhati Roy was born in Shillong, Meghalaya, India, to Mary Roy, a Malayali Syrian Christian women's rights activist from Kerala and Rajib Roy, a Bengali Hindu tea plantation manager from Calcutta. When she was two, her parents divorced and she returned to Kerala with her mother and brother. For a time, the family lived with Roy's maternal grandfather in Ooty, Tamil Nadu. When she was five, the family moved back to Kerala, where her mother started a school. Roy began writing her first novel, The God of Small Things, in 1992, completing it in 1996. The book is semi-autobiographical and a major part captures her childhood experiences in Aymanam. The publication of The God of Small Things catapulted Roy to international fame. It received the 1997 Booker Prize for Fiction and was listed as one of the New York Times Notable Books of the Year for 1997. It reached fourth position on the New York Times Bestsellers list for Independent Fiction. From the beginning, the book was also a commercial success: Roy received half a million pounds as an advance. It was published in May, and the book had been sold in eighteen countries by the end of June. The God of Small Things received stellar reviews in major American newspapers such as The New York Times (a \\"dazzling first novel,\\" \\"extraordinary\\", \\"at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple\\") and the Los Angeles Times (\\"a novel of poignancy and considerable sweep\\"), and in Canadian publications such as the Toronto Star (\\"a lush, magical novel\\"). By the end of the year, it had become one of the five best books of 1997 by Time. Critical response in the United Kingdom was less positive, and the awarding of the Booker Prize caused controversy; Carmen Callil, a 1996 Booker Prize judge, called the novel \\"execrable\\", and The Guardian called the context \\"profoundly depressing\\".

Question: suppose The owls hearing doesn't allow them to locate prey happens, how will it affect If more sunlight is gathered by the plant. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"In order to answer the question, let's break it down step by step: Step 1: Green is a color that gathers sunlight easily. This is true, as the green pigment chlorophyll in plants helps in gathering sunlight for photosynthesis. Step 2: Sunlight is gathered by the leaves of the plant. Yes, the leaves of the plant gather sunlight by using their chlorophyll content. Step 3: The sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis. Correctly, photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Step 4: The glucose travels the plant. That is accurate, the glucose produced acts as food for the plant and travels through its entire system. Step 5: The plant uses glucose as energy to grow. Yes, plants use the glucose produced during photosynthesis as a source of energy for growth and other functions. Now, let's examine the question: Suppose the owls' hearing doesn't allow them to locate prey, how will it affect if more sunlight is gathered by the plant? How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned? The effect of owls' hearing on the gathering of sunlight by plants is not directly related. The owls' ability to locate prey is a separate ecological factor that generally would not influence the photosynthesis process in plants. Therefore, the supposed perturbation would have no effect on the second effect (more sunlight gathered by the plant), as the two processes are not directly linked.

Es ist allerdings eine Schande, dass namentlich der Europäische Rat nicht seinen Verpflichtungen nachkommt. Translate this to English?","completion":"Indeed, it is a shame that, in particular, the European Council is not fulfilling its obligations. Here's a detailed and long answer explaining the possible reasons and contexts behind this statement: In the grand scheme of political and economic unions, the European Council, an essential component of the European Union, is known for playing a significant role in creating guidelines and making decisions that ultimately shape the trajectory of the union. However, the statement you provided criticizes the European Council for not living up to its duties, with a specific emphasis on its lack of commitment to obligations. Such a remark can be multifaceted, depending on the context in which it is made. Several factors could lead to such criticism: 1. Slow decision-making: This issue often arises when multiple stakeholders are involved in the decision-making process. Since the European Council is composed of leaders from its 27 member countries, reaching an agreeable consensus can be a challenging and time-consuming process, and in some situations, essential decisions may not be made promptly. 2. Ineffective policies: The institution may be criticized for not having sufficient effectiveness in addressing specific issues, which might contradict their outlined objectives and result in discontent with the European Council's performance. 3. Lack of transparency: Trust is a vital ingredient in any political or economic union, and transparency is one way of building and maintaining it. If the European Council fails to uphold transparency in its activities and decision-making processes, it may be accused of not fulfilling its obligations to EU citizens and the member countries. 4. Economic inequality: The European Council is responsible for providing guidance on critical economic policies. However, if these policies widen the gap between rich and poor countries in the EU or fail to distribute wealth and resources equitably, critics might argue that the institution is not living up to its role as a promoter of economic unity and solidarity. 5. Challenges in addressing crises: Whether it is the management of refugees, pandemics, or financial crises, the European Council is expected to take charge in coordinating unified responses among its member countries. If the institution is unable to do so effectively, it might be construed as not meeting its obligations. 6. Influence of larger member states: Sometimes, the European Council's decisions may be perceived as disproportionately influenced by the larger and more powerful member states, giving them more control over the decision-making process. Such imbalances might make it seem like the institution is not fulfilling its commitments to all members equally. Overall, the statement underlines that the European Council is not living up to its essential obligations, which might impact the European Union's effectiveness and integrity. However, to derive more specific conclusions, one must consider the context in which this statement was made."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Lake Burley Griffin is crossed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge (310 metres or 1,020 feet), Kings Avenue Bridge (270 metres or 890 feet) and a roadway over Scrivener Dam. The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures. Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known as \\"integral lighting\\". The design was deemed a success, so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards from the Illumination Engineering Society.Kings Avenue Bridge opened on 10 March 1962. Prime Minister Menzies unlocked a ceremonial chain before the motorcade and pageant crossed the lake in front of a large crowd. Commonwealth Avenue Bridge opened in 1963 without an official ceremony. Menzies called it \\"the finest building in the national capital\\". Answer:","completion":"Kings Avenue Bridge"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes. Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second spaceship has crash landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled into Earth's distant future.

Write some highlights for the following article: An unemployed security guard from Ecuador is Spain's top snoozer. Pedro Soria Lopez, 62, was able to nap for 17 minutes and register a 70-decibel snore while sprawled out on a couch in the middle of a crowded shopping mall in what's been billed as the first-ever Spanish National Siesta Championship, CNN sister network CNN Plus reported. The grand siesta champ won the first cash prize of 1,000 euros (about 1,400) in credit to purchase goods at the shopping center in Madrid. The competitors started off by lying down on blue sofas, some in pajamas. Each got to eat a lunch ahead of time, then had twenty minutes to get as much z's as they could squeeze in. Hundreds of contestants took part in the siesta championship which began October 14 and ended Saturday. The intricate rules award points to contestants depending on how long they sleep during the 20-minute competition time, any unusual positions they sleep in, eye-catching pajamas they might be wearing, and yes, a lot of extra points for snoring. The sponsors say it's meant to raise eyes to the problem of a country that's become so fast-paced that many say the traditional siesta is at risk. \\"The modern life is a danger that we feel is against the siesta. When you sleep la siesta everyone has the image that your life is calm, you have a good life. And then, the modern life is a direct attack,\\" said Daniel Blanco, president of the National Association of Friends of the Siesta earlier in the competition. His group, which includes about 50 of his friends across Spain, persuaded a shopping center, Islazul, to host and pay prize money for the siesta competition. In the competition, the siesta is limited to 20 minutes, a duration which the organizers and some doctors say is optimal; a quick nap after lunch to get refreshed, without entering a deep sleep cycle. But the traditional siesta in Spain often lasts an hour or more. The bustling shopping center where the siesta championship is being held is a prime example of the changing times in Spain. The stores don't close at lunchtime -- which is what used to happen with Spanish shops -- so instead of sleeping the siesta, people are working or shopping. Siesta lovers complain that Spain's frenetic push to compete in the global economy means longer, more pressure-package workdays, even if some Spanish workers still get a two-hour lunch break. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.

One big group of foods that is commonly linked to post-meal sleepiness is refined carbohydrates. These foods should be avoided or eaten in small quantities to avoid that afternoon sleepy feeling. Can we draw the following conclusion? Carbohydrates are an excellent way to stay alert. OPTIONS: [A]. Yes. [B]. It's impossible to say. [C]. No.","completion":"C. No. You cannot draw the conclusion that carbohydrates are an excellent way to stay alert from the information provided. The statement specifically refers to avoiding foods that contain refined carbohydrates as they are commonly linked to post-meal sleepiness. However, this does not imply that all carbohydrates inherently have this effect. It is important to differentiate between refined carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates. Refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, pasta, and sugary snacks, are processed and stripped of their nutrients and fiber content. Consuming these can cause a rapid spike in your blood sugar, followed by a quick drop, which can lead to feelings of drowsiness. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates, found in whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, provide a slower and steadier release of energy. They can help maintain alertness and sustain energy levels throughout the day, as they don't cause the same rapid blood sugar spike and crash experienced with refined carbohydrates. Thus, while refined carbohydrates should be avoided or limited to prevent drowsiness, consuming complex carbohydrates can contribute to steady energy levels and alertness. So, it would be more accurate to say that complex carbohydrates can be a good source of energy for staying alert, rather than claiming that carbohydrates, in general, are an excellent way to stay alert."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What Murray does land for Bobby is a full week headlining the grand opening of the world's first Glatt Kosher hotel-casino, Mazel Hotel. As it turns out, the real force behind Bobby Starr's curious invitation to this \\"Orthodox otherworld\\" is the hotel owner's persuasive daughter Rebekka Hershenfeld (Amy Davidson), who has harbored a huge crush on Bobby since childhood. Rebekka's world is guided by her arranged betrothal to Haim (Benjamin Bauman), the son of Grand Rabbi Sheinman (Joel Leffert), who is supposed to issue the casino's all-important \\"Kosher certificate.\\" Rebekka's only release from the pressures of preparing to be a future Rebitsin (Rabbi's wife) comes from singing along to Bobby's songs with her best friends Hani and Fani (Natasha Lyonne).

What is the best way to: Home made shoe polish.","completion":"The best way to make homemade shoe polish is by using natural and easily accessible ingredients. This DIY shoe polish is cost-effective, eco-friendly, and ensures that your leather shoes stay in top condition. Here's a detailed guide on how to make homemade shoe polish: Ingredients: 1. Beeswax: Beeswax provides a protective layer, seals in the natural oils, and repels water to keep your shoes in the best condition. 2. Coconut oil or olive oil: These natural oils moisturize and condition the leather to help prevent it from cracking. 3. Cocoa butter or shea butter (optional): These butters can also help condition and protect the leather while giving your polish a more spreadable consistency. 4. Essential oil (optional): A few drops of essential oil, such as lemon or lavender, can add a pleasant scent to your shoe polish. 5. A small tin or container: To store your homemade shoe polish. Instructions: 1. Measure the ingredients: To make the shoe polish, follow this ratio - two parts oil, one part beeswax, and half a part of cocoa or shea butter. The actual measurements can be adjusted according to the quantity you plan to make. For example, you can measure using tablespoons or ounces - 4 tablespoons coconut oil, 2 tablespoons beeswax, and 1 tablespoon cocoa butter. 2. Melt beeswax and butter: Use a double boiler to melt the beeswax and cocoa/shea butter together. If you don't have a double boiler, place the ingredients in a heatproof bowl on top of a pot with a small amount of water in it. Heat the water over low to medium heat, ensuring the water doesn't touch the bowl. Continuously stir the mixture until the beeswax and butter have melted and combined. 3. Add oil and essential oils: Remove the mixture from heat and allow it to cool slightly. Then, add the coconut or olive oil to the mixture and stir. If you want to add a scent, incorporate a few drops of essential oil of your choice. 4. Pour into the container: Before the mixture solidifies, carefully pour it into your chosen tin or container. Allow it to cool and set completely at room temperature. 5. Store and usage: Store your homemade shoe polish in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent melting. When it's time to polish your shoes, take a small amount using a soft polishing cloth or an old brush, apply it to the shoe surface in a circular motion, covering the entire leather surface. Allow the shoe polish to sit for a few minutes, then buff it out with a clean, dry cloth or brush for a beautiful shine. By following these steps to make homemade shoe polish, you'll not only save money but also make a more sustainable and eco-friendly choice in maintaining your leather shoes.

Based on the premise \\"well i've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine and they have said no\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"There is no TexTeller machine to speak of.\\" is true?","completion":"To address the hypothesis \\"There is no TexTeller machine to speak of\\" based on the given premise \\"well i've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine and they have said no\\", we must carefully analyze the evidence provided and consider alternative explanations. First, let's break down the premise: 1. People try to come in over the weekend intending to use the TexTeller machine. 2. They said \\"no\\" to these people. The fact that people are coming to use the TexTeller machine indicates that there is a demand for this device or service, which suggests that a TexTeller machine may indeed exist. It is important to understand why \\"they\\" (possibly the establishment's staff) have said \\"no.\\" There could be various reasons for this response, which might or might not support the hypothesis in question. Possible explanations for \\"no\\" response: 1. The TexTeller machine is temporarily out of order, which does not support the hypothesis that there is no TexTeller machine to speak of. 2. The facility may have limited hours of operation or specific usage policies (e.g., not available on weekends), which also does not support the hypothesis. 3. People are confusing the location or establishment and there is no TexTeller machine in the given place, but it might exist elsewhere. In this case, the hypothesis could be considered true in this particular location but not in general. 4. The TexTeller machine has been removed or is no longer available at this location. In this scenario, the hypothesis is true for this location; however, it does not confirm that the TexTeller machine does not exist at all. To conclude whether the hypothesis is true or not, we need more information and context surrounding the situation. The premise we have implies that there could be a TexTeller machine in existence since people are specifically seeking it out for usage. However, the given premise alone is insufficient to definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis \\"There is no TexTeller machine to speak of.\\" A more thorough investigation, including gathering additional details and verifying facts, would be necessary to provide a clear answer to the hypothesis. This could include: a. Visiting the location and verifying the presence or absence of the TexTeller machine. b. Acquiring information from the establishment's staff or management regarding the TexTeller machine. c. Researching other locations or businesses that might have a TexTeller machine available for use. Only by analyzing this additional information can we draw a well-founded conclusion about the existence of the TexTeller machine and determine if the hypothesis is true or false."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

We can use a loop to iterate through the given list of integers and check if each number is even. If a number is even, we keep it in our result list. Otherwise, we skip it. Once we have checked all the numbers in the input list, we return the result list containing only the even numbers. Here's the step-by-step process: 1.

We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great.

You owe 112 candies! But then you went to the candy shop and buy a lot more, remember? So: -112 candies (owed) + 2352 candies (bought) = 2240 candies.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: Young d'Artagnan leaves his parents and travels from his native Gascony to the capital of France because he wants to prove himself an excellent fencer and to become a musketeer. He is told by his father he must not avoid any duel. On his way to Paris, d'Artagnan feels that his honour is besmirched because he overhears how his horse is derided by a sinister nobleman. He can't help but demand immediate satisfaction. Unfortunately, of all men he finds he has challenged the Count de Rochefort, a shifty character to whom Cardinal Richelieu frequently entrusts covert operations. Rochefort's henchmen take care of d'Artagnan and steal from him. The enraged d'Artagnan is determined to take revenge and will eventually have the chance to do so, for the Queen has given a present to her secret admirer the Duke of Buckingham, and d'Artagnan must retrieve it from him, although he is now already back in England. If he fails her, Cardinal Richelieu is going to disclose Queen Anne's infidelity to King Louis XIII, in order to force a war against England upon him. The Cardinal and Count de Rochefort will do everything in their power if only they can put paid to d'Artagnan's mission. But with help from his three new friends d'Artagnan prevails. My question: Who else shows up at the Ruins?","completion":"At the ruins, a critical turning point in the movie, various characters that hold significant importance to the story show up. These characters include: 1. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis: The titular Three Musketeers, who ultimately become d'Artagnan's closest friends and allies. Throughout the movie, they unite to help d'Artagnan in his endeavors, including his mission to retrieve the Queen's present. 2. Milady de Winter: A mysterious and cunning agent of Cardinal Richelieu, Milady de Winter becomes a pivotal antagonist in the story. She is responsible for trying to foil d'Artagnan's plans and works closely with Count de Rochefort. Her presence at the ruins adds an element of peril or intrigue to the scene. 3. Constance Bonacieux: A close confidante of Queen Anne, Constance plays a crucial role in helping d'Artagnan on his journey. She secretly supports and aids the musketeers, and her presence at the ruins could signify a crucial exchange of information or a moment of suspense in the storyline. 4. The Duke of Buckingham: Given his connection to the Queen, it's possible for the Duke to make an appearance at the ruins, perhaps as part of a covert meeting. The Duke's presence may further complicate d'Artagnan's mission or result in a tense standoff between the different factions present. 5. Cardinal Richelieu: It would not be surprising if Cardinal Richelieu himself made a surprise appearance at the ruins, working behind the scenes to orchestrate events to his advantage. His presence would heighten the stakes and tension in the scene. These characters' presence in the ruins scene can significantly impact the storyline, creating opportunities for confrontation, plot twists, and the development of alliances. Developing this scene with a mix of these characters will keep the audience on their toes and drive the plot forward."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Crushed to death: Gary Whiting, 51, died immediately when a co-worker switched on a machine he was inside. Arms maker BAE Systems is facing a fine of at least £100,000 after admitting responsibility for the death of a worker crushed to death in a metal press. Gary Whiting, 51, died immediately from his injuries when a fellow worker switched on the press at BAE's Brough plant in East Yorkshire without realising he was still inside. Mr Whiting, who lived with wife Jacqueline in nearby east Hull, had worked at the company for 21 years. He was due to retire the following year. At Hull Crown Court yesterday, BAE Operations Limited admitted health and safety breaches led to the maintenance man's death on November 10, 2008. In court, a specialist inspector from the Health and Safety Executive condemned the firm for failing to implement measures that could have avoided the tragedy. In particular, investigators were concerned that the press could be turned on while a person was inside. At the time of the tragedy, Mr Whiting had been working as part of a four-strong maintenance team, tasked with servicing the machine. The jury at the inquest was told the recognised 'safe system' of working involved checking if anyone was in the machine, and shouting to one another, before turning it on. However, John Moutrie, a specialist HSE inspector, criticised the system that was in place for workers using the machine. He explained that a safer system of working would be using ISO Locks, where each member of the team has a padlock to place on the machine if they are going inside. This would eliminate the risk of a worker turning on a machine, not knowing a colleague is inside, he said. Richard Lissack QC, representing BAE, said: 'The company accepts it failed to take all reasonable and practical steps to care for the safety of this man who died in this awful accident.' He added that the company accepted they could have had 'physical control methods' that could have been used to avoid Mr Whiting’s death. Entrance to BAe Brough Plant: This entrance is situated on Saltgrounds Road. The QC extended BAE's condolences to the Whiting family, saying: 'Mr Whiting was a valued and popular workman and highly experienced. 'His death was truly shocking, in the truest sense of the word, to those who knew and liked him for many years.' Mr Whiting was a member of both East Hull Harriers and Athletics Club and Holderness Bowling Club and loved his job, according to his family. Speaking after the inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death, they said they did not believe Mr Whiting was at fault as he was not told the machine was about to be turned on. They also made clear they do not hold Alan Abbott, who turned the machine on, to blame. In a statement, they said: 'The family do not hold the operator of the press, nor indeed any other individual, personally responsible for Gary’s death.' Judge Michael Mettyear adjourned sentencing until a date in June. Earlier this year BAE announced it was shutting down its Brough plant, ending more than 100 years of manufacturing at the site.

The press was turned on by another worker who didn't know that Gary was still inside.

State Police were brought in to assist Sunbury Police in the ongoing investigation into this matter. While it's reported that two individuals were evacuated from the area, they are not currently being named as suspects in the case. This indicates that law enforcement officials are actively investigating the presence of a meth lab in Sunbury. It is important to note that the final confirmation of the meth lab's existence will depend on the outcome of the investigation being conducted by the authorities.

Title: Greg Dawson, Orlando Sentinel Review: \\"We don't have Kafka to do justice to HMOs, but we do have Michael Freeny, a most timely novel about the creepy world of managed care.\\" Is the review positive or negative? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Positive. To determine whether the given review is positive or negative, I will analyze the content of the review. In this review, the comparison to Kafka and the use of the word \\"creepy\\" might seem negative, but the context is essential to understanding the intention of the reviewer. Step 1: Analyzing the comparison to Kafka Although Kafka's work generally has a dark and eerie tone, the mention of Kafka in this review is intended as a compliment to the author Michael Freeny. By comparing the author's work to Kafka, the reviewer is acknowledging the skill of the writer in tackling complex and dark subjects like the world of managed care. Step 2: Understanding the mention of a \\"timely novel\\" The reviewer calls the novel \\"a most timely novel,\\" which indicates that the book is relevant and important at the time it is being reviewed. This suggests that the reviewer sees value in the novel's content and theme, which is a positive remark. Step 3: Analyzing the mention of the \\"creepy world of managed care\\" While \\"creepy\\" may be seen as a negative term, it serves here as a descriptor of managed care rather than a criticism of the book itself. By characterizing managed care this way, the reviewer is essentially praising the author for their ability to portray this \\"creepy world\\" accurately and engagingly. Based on these steps and the context of the review, we can conclude that the review is positive as it commends the author's skill and the novel's relevance to the current state of managed care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(February 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino), a defense attorney in Baltimore, is in jail on a contempt of court charge after punching Judge Henry T. Fleming (John Forsythe) while arguing the case of Jeff McCullaugh (Thomas G. Waites). McCullagh was stopped for a minor traffic offence, but then mistaken for a killer of the same name and has already spent a year and a half in jail; Fleming has repeatedly stymied Kirkland's efforts to have the case reviewed. Though there is strong new evidence that Jeff is innocent, Fleming refuses McCullaugh's appeal due to its late submission and leaves him in prison. After being released, Arthur takes another case, that of a transgender Ralph Agee (Robert Christian), arrested for small crime and becoming a victim of the legal system. Arthur pays regular visits to his grandfather Sam (Lee Strasberg) in a nursing home, who is progressively becoming senile. It is revealed that Arthur was abandoned by his parents at a young age, and it was Sam who raised him and put him through law school. Arthur also begins a romance with a legal ethics committee member, Gail Packer (Christine Lahti). Arthur has a friendly relationship with Judge Francis Rayford (Jack Warden), who takes him on a hair-raising ride in his personal helicopter, laughing as he tests how far they can possibly go without running out of fuel, while a terrified Arthur begs him to land. Rayford, a veteran of the Korean War, is borderline suicidal and keeps a rifle in his chambers at the courthouse, a 1911 pistol in his shoulder holster at all times, and eats his lunch on the ledge outside his office window, four stories up. One day, Arthur is unexpectedly requested to defend Fleming, who has been accused of brutally assaulting and raping a young woman.

At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an international organization working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. It is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, lobbying and education. IUCN's mission is to \\"influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable.\\" - Pirkanmaa (also known as Tampere Region in government documents), is a region of Finland. It borders on the regions of Satakunta, Tavastia Proper, Päijät-Häme, Southern Ostrobothnia, Central Finland and Southwest Finland. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\". - A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas. - A swamp is a wetland that is forested. Many swamps occur along large rivers where they are critically dependent upon natural water level fluctuations. Other swamps occur on the shores of large lakes. Some swamps have hammocks, or dry-land protrusions, covered by aquatic vegetation, or vegetation that tolerates periodic inundation. The two main types of swamp are \\"true\\" or swamp forests and \\"transitional\\" or shrub swamps. In the boreal regions of Canada, the word swamp is colloquially used for what is more correctly termed a bog or muskeg. The water of a swamp may be fresh water, brackish water or seawater. Some of the world's largest swamps are found along major rivers such as the Amazon, the Mississippi, and the Congo. - Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe. - A park is an area of natural, semi-natural, or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. It may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil, and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer, baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called \\"dog parks\\", permit dogs to run off-leash. - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition. - An esker, eskar, eschar, or os, sometimes called an \\"asar\\", \\"osar\\", or \\"serpent kame\\", is a long, winding ridge of stratified sand and gravel, examples of which occur in glaciated and formerly glaciated regions of Europe and North America. Eskers are frequently several kilometres long and, because of their peculiar uniform shape, are somewhat like railway embankments. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - A drainage divide, water divide, divide, ridgeline, watershed, water parting, or (in Canada) height of land, is the line that separates neighbouring drainage basins.

They are found primarily in Russian Karelia, and the provinces of North Karelia, Savonia and Kainuu in Finland, though some range into central south Finland. They are distinct from the semi-domesticated Northern reindeer (\\"Rangifer tarandus tarandus\\") in their larger size and preference for dense boreal forest habitat, where they are rarely seen by humans, over the open tundra. They migrate seasonally back and forth across the long Russo-Finnish border. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states.

The national park was established in 1982 and later expanded in 1989 . It now covers 45.5 square kilometres ( 17.6 sq mi ) . The park is a typical mix of upland and lowland coniferous boreal forests of the Suomenselkä watershed region . Upland areas are dominated by closed productive stands of Norway spruce and Scots pine while lowland areas are covered by sphagnum swamp and bog areas that also contain stunted ( Scots pine ) and shrublike ( Norway spruce ) . These swamp and bog areas appear to be barren due to the sparse tree densities . Parts of the park contain some of the most ancient and oldest forests that are accessible to public in Finland . The Kovero Farm ( Finnish : Koveron kruununmetsätorppa ) , a tenant farm established in 1859 , is part of the cultural heritage area of the park . Seitseminen National Park received the European Diploma of Protected Areas on June 19 , 1996 . It was valid until June 2011 . - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Ikaalinen is a town and municipality of Finland. It is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Pirkanmaa region. The town has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is - The Gulf of Finland is the easternmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) all the way to Saint Petersburg in Russia, where the river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf. - The World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) is one of six commissions of the IUCN (World Conservation Union). WCPA is the world's premier network of protected area expertise. It is administered by IUCN's Global Protected Areas Programme and has over 2,400 members, spanning 140 countries. - Population density (in agriculture: standing stock and standing crop) is a measurement of population per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type number density. It is frequently applied to living organisms, and most of the time to humans. It is a key geographical term. - The Gulf of Bothnia is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast and Sweden's east coast. In the south of the gulf lie the Åland Islands, between the Sea of Åland and the Archipelago Sea. - Tampere (Swedish: \\"Tammerfors\\" ) is a city in Pirkanmaa, southern Finland. It is the most populous inland city in any of the Nordic countries. - Suomenselkä is a drainage divide in western Finland. Roughly long and wide, it is marked by an ensemble of northeast-southwest oriented moraines parallel to the Bothnian coastline. Rivers flowing west from Suomenselkä drain to the Gulf of Bothnia and the lakes in the east drain to the Gulf of Finland. Historically, this very sparsely populated region separated Ostrobothnia from the southern and eastern lake regions of Finland. The landscape is marked by moraines, eskers, swamps and forests and is difficult to cultivate or settle in. Because it contains some of the few remaining patches of old-growth forest in southern Finland, it is one of the few remaining habitats for Finnish Forest Reindeer (\\"Rangifer tarandus fennica\\"). - A moraine is any glacially formed accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris (soil and rock) that occurs in both currently and formerly glaciated regions on Earth (i.e. a past glacial maximum), through geomorphological processes. Moraines are formed from debris previously carried along by a glacier and normally consist of somewhat rounded particles ranging in size from large boulders to minute glacial flour. Lateral moraines are formed at the side of the ice flow and terminal moraines at the foot, marking the maximum advance of the glacier. Other types of moraine include ground moraines, till-covered areas with irregular topography, and medial moraines which are formed where two glaciers meet. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - An old-growth forest also termed primary forest, virgin forest, primeval forest, late seral forest, or (in Britain) ancient woodland is a forest that has attained great age without significant disturbance and thereby exhibits unique ecological features and might be classified as a climax community. Old-growth features include diverse tree-related structures that provide diverse wildlife habitat that increases the bio-diversity of the forested ecosystem. The concept of diverse tree structure includes multi-layered canopies and canopy gaps, greatly varying tree heights and diameters, and diverse tree species and classes and sizes of woody debris. - Ylöjärvi is a town and a municipality in Western Finland, west of Tampere and north of Finlands capital city Helsinki.

Christie's, a famous place that sells very pretty and expensive things like paintings, just got special permission to have their own \\"store\\" in mainland China!

Then, the person who said the highest price gets to take the pretty thing home. What's really important about this news is that the Chinese art market has been growing faster than any other art market in the entire world for the past 5 years. So, this means that lots of people in China are excited to buy paintings and other special treasures at Christie's new store. Now that Christie's has the special permission, more people can enjoy and buy the beautiful paintings and treasures they sell, and the nice people at Christie's are excited to share their love for art with the people in China.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What collection did the money Gregory put in a safe deposit box come from? Answer the above question based on the context below: Paul Gregory, a Canadian confidence trickster operating in London, targets a wealthy Canadian woman in Britain to sell her collection of valuable coins. After meeting her at an ice hockey match, he sets about winning her confidence until she is prepared to give him legal control over the sale. He completes the deal without her knowledge, puts the money from the sale in a safe deposit box, and then deliberately waits to be caught by the police. Gregory plans on getting a five-year sentence, with time off for good behaviour, and then collecting his loot when he is released. However, the judge makes an example of the uncooperative Gregory by handing down a ten-year term. Not wishing to spend so much time in jail, Gregory pays Victor Sloane, one of his associates on the outside, to help him escape. Almost immediately, things begin to go wrong. Fearing arrest, he is unable for the moment to recover the money from the safe. Sloane also now begins to demand more money, threatening him with violence, and Gregory is forced to retaliate. Gregory tries to get help from his fellow criminals, calling upon an established code that exists between them. But when his former associate Sloane is found dead – accidentally having choked to death on the gag Gregory placed in his mouth – they refuse to offer him any assistance, as he is now too \\"hot\\". With the manhunt rapidly closing in, he tries to escape with the help of Bridget Howard, a disillusioned ex-débutante and niece of a Chief Constable. She drives Gregory to a deserted cottage near her family's home in rural Wales. While in hiding, he witnesses the police arrive to question Bridget, assumes the worst, and flees again. Attempting to steal a farmer's bicycle, he is shot in the shoulder. He drives away in a stolen truck but crashes and passes out, where he is found by another farmer. Bridget tells the police nothing. She waits in vain for Gregory at the cottage, then walks into the distance. Answer:","completion":"The money Gregory put in a safe deposit box came from the sale of a valuable coin collection that belonged to the wealthy Canadian woman he targeted in Britain. Gregory, a Canadian confidence trickster, had met the woman at an ice hockey match and carefully gained her trust until she agreed to give him legal control over the sale of her coin collection. He executed the sale without her knowledge or consent, secretly stashing the proceeds in a safe deposit box to collect after serving a planned short prison sentence. Unfortunately for him, the judge sentenced him to a longer term than he anticipated, setting off a series of events that resulted in his quest to retrieve the money while avoiding arrest and dealing with threats from his associates."},{"prompt":"What is the full name of the Beatles band member that had a son Zak? Answer the above question based on the context below: By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup. On the Beatles' return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up. George Harrison informed Epstein that he was...

It is separated from Israel and Egypt by the Gulf of Aqaba. It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert or barren landforms. - Isis (original Egyptian pronunciation more likely \\"Aset\\" or \\"Iset\\") is a goddess from the polytheistic pantheon of Egypt. She was first worshiped in ancient Egyptian religion, and later her worship spread throughout the Roman Empire and the greater Greco-Roman world. Isis is still widely worshiped by many pagans today in diverse religious contexts; including a number of distinct pagan religions, the modern Goddess movement, and interfaith organizations such as the Fellowship of Isis. - Bakhdida (Arabic:) , also known as Baghdeda, Qaraqosh, or Al-Hamdaniya, is an Assyrian city in northern Iraq within the Nineveh Governorate, located about 32 km (20 mi) southeast of the city of Mosul and 60 km west of Erbil amid agricultural lands, close to the ruins of the ancient Assyrian cities Nimrud and Nineveh. It is connected to the main city of Mosul by two main roads. The first runs through the towns of Bartella and Karamles which connects to the city of Erbil as well. The second, which was gravel until being paved in the 1990s, is direct to Mosul. All of its citizens fled to Iraqi Kurdistan after the ISIS invasion on August 6, 2014.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\".

MALS was formed here more than 30 years ago. Today, 14 staff attorneys, 26 office workers and 21 University of Memphis third- year law students work out of rented offices in the old Claridge Hotel building at 109 N. Main. Offices are spartan. There are no lush rugs or stylish furniture. The large table in the conference room is simple varnished wood. Offices are small and mostly plain, except for the eclectic mix of pop art, African statuary and neon that adorns litigation director Webb Brewer's space. Brewer, who has been at the agency 20 years, said there is a need for lawyers of all stripes to help with the problems of the poor. \\"The private bar could meet more of the need through pro bono work, but there are still cases that involve the systemic problems for low-income people that we would need to do,\\" said Brewer. \\"The legal system marketplace just doesn't serve low-income people too well, except in fee-generat-ing type cases,\\" Brewer said. \\"If a poor person gets run over by a bus, an attorney might take that case because they might be able to recover part of the damage award as attorney fees. But so many of the cases we handle have to do with basic rights and a decent life. There is just no profit motive.\\" Larry Pivnick, law professor at the University of Memphis Law School and director of political programs at MALS, said Legal Services is a great learning laboratory for law students. \\"There are thousands and thousands of people who have problems that never get an opportunity to appear in court,\\" Pivnick said. \\"Some people may not be particularly articulate. Courts have rules that clients don't always understand.\\" Brewer said a major focus of the agency's work involves housing. \\"Although a lot of our work is grant-driven, we find that the lack of safe and decent affordable housing and the prevalence of predatory lending are the biggest problems in our client population,\\" Brewer said, referring to clients such as James.

We must therefore use the available quantity of natural resources in a sustainable way Danish companies must continue adjusting production to a smaller input of resources per unit produced to be successful in the global market where scarcity of resources must be anticipated Add punctuation","completion":"We must, therefore, use the available quantity of natural resources in a sustainable way. Danish companies must continue adjusting production to a smaller input of resources per unit produced to be successful in the global market, where scarcity of resources must be anticipated. It is imperative for Danish companies, along with businesses worldwide, to adapt their production models to promote sustainable use of natural resources. By doing this, they will not only contribute to the preservation of Earth's resources but will also stay competitive in an increasingly volatile global market shaped by resource constraints. To achieve sustainability in resource consumption, companies need to incorporate efficient resource management strategies in their business models. This might include embracing a circular economy, which focuses on reducing waste and using resources in a closed-loop manner. Companies can invest in research and development to create eco-friendly products and production methodologies, and also involve themselves in clean technologies, green energy, and recycling. For Danish companies to remain successful globally, they must strive to become champions of sustainability. They can do so by reevaluating their supply chains, aiming to source raw materials in a responsible and environmentally friendly manner. Collaborative efforts, such as forming partnerships with sustainable suppliers, can ensure the efficient use of resources and make it feasible for these businesses to operate in a world facing resource constraints. Additionally, ensuring environmentally-friendly production processes and minimizing waste can help reduce the input of resources per unit produced. Implementing waste recycling systems and utilizing excess production materials in other products or components can significantly contribute to this objective. Educating employees on the necessity of resource conservation and integrating sustainability values in their corporate culture can also lead to better decision-making at all levels of the organization. By setting sustainability goals and constantly monitoring their progress, companies would ensure that they are on track to reach their resource-efficiency targets. The government plays a crucial role in promoting sustainable practices as well. Policymakers can incentivize businesses to adopt resource-efficient models by providing tax benefits, subsidies, and other forms of financial support. Additionally, setting stringent environmental regulations to curb resource wastage and pollution will help in raising industry standards and fostering sustainability. In conclusion, for Danish companies to succeed in a global market characterized by the anticipation of resource scarcity, a comprehensive shift toward sustainable management of resources is necessary. By adjusting production processes, focusing on environmentally-friendly practices, and fostering collaborations with sustainable suppliers, these businesses can contribute to the preservation of natural resources while also staying competitive in a resource-conscious world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Frustrated and determined, Julia decided to remove the obstruction that prevented her from placing her new bookshelf in its rightful place inside her living room. She headed to the garage to gather supplies, searching for the tools she would need for the project. As she rummaged through dusty bins and cluttered shelves, she found a handsaw, a hammer, a chisel, and some protective gloves and goggles. With confidence in her eyes and a ready stance, she strode back to the doorframe, ready to tackle the task at hand. First, she donned the goggles and gloves for safety, ensuring that her hands and eyes were protected from any splinters or debris that might fly off during the removal process. Then, carefully examining the wooden frame, she chose the right spot to make her initial cut. Julia wielded the handsaw, positioning it at a slight angle against the grain of the wood. With determination, she began to saw slowly through the frame, being cautious of the surrounding walls and paying close attention to the piece of wood she was attempting to remove. Sawdust and wood shavings settled to the ground as the blade bit into the material. Once she had made a clean incision, Julia then took up the chisel and hammer. She gently wedged the chisel into the cut that she had made with the saw. Grasping the hammer with confidence, she gave the chisel a firm tap, driving it further into the opening. With each strike, the wooden piece became gradually dislodged, as splinters and chips cascaded to the floor. Julia continued this process until she could finally see the wooden segment loosening enough to be removed by hand. With a proud grin, she grabbed hold of the frame and gave it a good yank. As the wood came free from the doorway with a gratifying snap, she couldn't help but feel a rush of triumph. Julia took a moment to brush the debris away from the area, ensuring that no hazards remained. She closely examined her work, making sure that the doorway's structural integrity remained intact and strong. Satisfied with her handiwork, she finally returned the tools to their places in the garage and began preparations to move her bookshelf into her living room. With the doorway now widened and rid of the troublesome wooden frame, Julia was able to position her bookshelf exactly where she envisioned it. As she placed her beloved books onto the new shelves, she took pride in her handiwork and the perseverance it took her to overcome this unexpected obstacle. Julia knew that she had not only managed to alter her doorway to fit her new furniture but had also grown as an individual. Through determination and resourcefulness, she had faced her problem head-on and welcomed the challenge presented before her. And in the process, she had discovered that she was capable of more than she initially thought. In removing the wood from the doorway, Julia had carved out a new and exciting chapter in her life, opening her heart and mind to the endless possibilities that she could conquer, one task at a time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which entity is this text about? Kara (Hangul: kara, Japanese: kara, often stylized as KARA) was a South Korean pop girl group formed by DSP Media in 2007. The group's final lineup was composed of Park Gyuri, Han Seungyeon, Goo Hara and Heo Youngji. Members Nicole Jung and Kang Ji-young officially departed from the group in 2014, while Kim Sung-hee left in 2008. The group's name comes from the Greek word \\"chara\\" (khara, lit. \\"joy\\"), which they interpreted to mean \\"sweet melody\\". The group was scheduled to have their comeback in March 2008 with their second album, however, member Kim Sung-hee suddenly announced that she would be leaving the group due to parental pressure because her participation in the group was contingent on the maintenance of her grades. In response, DSP stated that the second album that was recorded would be shelved and replaced by a mini-album to come in May; in addition, two members would join the group. Auditions were held, and the two new members were eventually revealed to be Goo Ha-ra and Kang Jiyoung. The group made their return in the music industry as a quintet on July 24, 2008 with \\"Rock U\\" on M! Countdown. They made their comeback with the \\"cute\\" and \\"playful\\" image which was the complete opposite of the group's original image from their debut. In the same month, their first mini-album titled Rock U was also released. The second season of Kara Self Camera was premiered on August 18, 2008, which chronicled how the group was adapting to their two new members. On November 29, 2008, DSP released a teaser video for their upcoming single, \\"Pretty Girl\\", which received over 40,000 hits within 12 hours. The full video was released on December 2, 2008 online and was positively received by the public. The EP, Pretty Girl, was released on December 4, embodying a \\"fun-party\\" concept. The group began its comeback on all major music shows on December 4, 2008, starting with M! Countdown. During their first national performance on KBS's Music Bank, member Goo Hara accidentally gasped \\"ah!\\" live on air due to slipping on falling confetti, and reportedly cried profusely afterwards. The incident became a hot issue to many viewers, but Goo Hara received comfort instead of criticism from the general public.

Write a text based on \\"chinese vice premier huang ju ally of ex-president dies after long illness\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Remembering Huang Ju: A Loyal Ally of China's Ex-President Passes Away after Prolonged Illness In the ever-evolving political landscape of China, the news of the passing away of Huang Ju, former Chinese Vice Premier and a close ally of Ex-President Jiang Zemin, is a moment to reflect on the contributions and impact of this influential political figure. After a long battle with illness, Huang Ju's death signifies the end of a significant era in Chinese politics. A deeply committed administrator, a respected loyalist, and an astute strategist, Huang Ju's legacy in Chinese political realms will live on. Born on September 16, 1938, in Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, Huang Ju's upbringing and education laid the foundation for his future ascent to the upper echelons of Chinese politics. He studied electrical engineering at Tsinghua University and later earned a degree in economics from the Central Party School. His life as a Communist Party member began in 1966, after which he quickly climbed the ranks to hold several key provincial and city-level positions. Huang Ju's tenure in the Chinese government saw the country go through some major political and economic transformations, as China sought to find its place on the global stage. As a close ally of Ex-President Jiang Zemin, Huang Ju was instrumental in steering important reforms and decision-making processes that helped shape the China we know today. His leadership in Shanghai, the country's economic hub, amidst the city's rapid economic development in the 1990s, is often regarded as a prime example of his astute abilities to foresee strategic goals, formulate policies, and ensure efficient implementation. During his time with the government, Huang Ju also held key positions such as the Mayor of Shanghai (1991-1994), the Party Secretary of Shanghai (1994-2002), and the Executive Vice Premier of the State Council (2003-2006). His tenure as the Executive Vice Premier saw him in charge of various policy areas, including finance, state planning, and economic affairs. He was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest decision-making body in the Communist Party of China, cementing his position as an influential political figure with a crucial role in the country's trajectory. Furthermore, his close association with Jiang Zemin placed him in the center of the \\"Shanghai Clique,\\" an informal network of politicians that rose to prominence during the 1990s and early 2000s, reflecting the close-knit ties between governmental leaders. This deepened the influence and decision-making power of Huang Ju and the Jiang faction in the Chinese political landscape. While Huang Ju's contributions to Chinese politics and his role as a key administrator are indisputable, his tenure was not without controversies. His association with the Shanghai Pension Fund scandal in 2006 raised questions about his integrity and led to speculations that he may be implicated. However, he maintained a low profile and his illness deterred any significant investigation into the matter. Despite a life marred by illness in his later years, Huang Ju's role in shaping China's political landscape and his steadfast loyalty to his close ally, Ex-President Jiang Zemin, speak volumes about his unwavering commitment to the nation and its people. As we bid farewell to this important figure in Chinese history, we acknowledge the many ways he intricately influenced the country's journey in both domestic and international affairs. It is now upon the shoulders of the present and future leaders of China to ensure this legacy continues to propel the nation forward in an increasingly interconnected and complex world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Geronimo (Mescalero-Chiricahua: Goyaale [koja:le] \\"the one who yawns\\"; June 16, 1829 - February 17, 1909) was a prominent leader and medicine man from the Bedonkohe band of the Chiricahua Apache tribe. Geronimo was raised with the traditional religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, he wrote in his 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death ... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it. In his later years Geronimo embraced Christianity, and stated Since my life as a prisoner has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers ... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because it seems to me the best religion in enabling one to live right. He joined the Dutch Reformed Church in 1903, but four years later was expelled for gambling. To the end of his life, he seemed to harbor ambivalent religious feelings, telling the Christian missionaries at a summer camp meeting in 1908 that he wanted to start over, while at the same time telling his tribesmen that he held to the old Apache religion. What religion was Geronimo?","completion":"Geronimo, a prominent leader and medicine man from the Bedonkohe band of the Chiricahua Apache tribe, was initially raised with the traditional religious views of his tribe. The Apache religion centered around nature and its spiritual powers, with a belief in life after death. However, the Apache people did not have specific ideas about their relations and surroundings in the afterlife. In his later years, Geronimo embraced Christianity. He believed the teachings of the white man's religion to be better than the traditional Apache belief system in many respects. In 1903, Geronimo joined the Dutch Reformed Church, adopting the Christian faith and advising his people to study it as well. He considered this religion to be helpful in enabling one to live right. However, in 1907, Geronimo was expelled from the church due to gambling. Throughout his life, Geronimo seemed to harbor ambivalent religious feelings. While he became a Christian and expressed a desire to improve his life through Christianity, he also maintained connections to the traditional Apache religion, discussing it with his tribesmen.

Jerry laughs and walks away when he is splashed with a tear from a female elephant, who is crying because her foot has a tack underneath it. Jerry jumps up the post and pulls out the tack. However, the elephant hangs back, afraid of Jerry (because he's a mouse and some elephants are afraid of mice). When Tom approaches her and the elephant picks him up with her trunk and hits him on the stand. Jerry watches him leave dizzy and re-emerges from his hiding place. He doesn't give up as he shows her the tack he pulled out of her foot. The elephant stops panicing, looks at her foot, and smiles. She hugs him in gratitude and gets over her fear of mice.An irate, Tom pulls up a ladder and swipes the mouse from her trunk. However, he meets the elephant's anger, who snatches Jerry fom his hand and places him on top of her head. She punches him and the ladder into the ground with her trunk. Then she returns to hugging the mouse. Tom emerges from the ground, dazed, and then falls unconscious.Act 1: When it's time for the first act, Tom is sitting behind the stool, annoyed until he spots Jerry who is dressed up as a clown, running behind the other clowns.

In a display of unwavering focus and agility, the Huskies achieved a stunning 100% free throw conversion rate. The team's relentless practice and drive paid off as they converted each opportunity, resulting in a vital contribution to their final score. The performance stood in stark contrast to the Wildcats, who stumbled at the charity stripe, missing a total of 11 free throws.

Question: Thanksgiving will be here before we know it! If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too.

You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like.

Jacksonville scored first on a 4-yard touchdown run by QB Byron Leftwich. The Colts were not able to respond until early in the second quarter when WR/PR Terrence Wilkins returned a punt 82 yards for a touchdown. Indianapolis grabbed the lead for the first time in the game during the third quarter on QB Peyton Manning's 30-yard touchdown pass to TE Dallas Clark. In the fourth quarter, Manning increased Indianapolis' lead on an uncharacteristic two-yard touchdown run. That score put the Colts up 21-7. The Jaguars, though, would get to within a touchdown late in the game on Byron Leftwich's 7-yard TD pass to RB Maurice Jones-Drew. That score, however, proved to be the last of the game as Indianapolis hung on for the victory, and improved their record to 3-0. Quarterback Peyton Manning finished the game 14 of 31 with 219 passing yards for one touchdown pass, while Byron Leftwich finished 16 of 28 with 107 passing yards for one touchdown pass. Leftwich also threw two interceptions. RB Maurice Jones-Drew had 103 rushing yards for Jacksonville, and Marvin Harrison had 6 catches for 94 yards receiving.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions?, using the article: In July 1873 the U.S. Navy dispatched USS Juniata to Greenland, to search for survivors from the Polaris expedition which had disintegrated after the death of its leader, Charles Francis Hall. Juniata's second-in-command was George W. De Long, a 28-year-old graduate of the United States Naval Academy, making his first visit to the Arctic. Ice conditions prevented Juniata from advancing beyond Upernavik; De Long volunteered to take the ship's tender, a small steamer named the Little Juniata, in the hope of finding survivors at Cape York, a further 400 nautical miles (740 km) north.The attempt failed; Little Juniata faced extreme weather conditions, and was forced to retreat a few miles from Cape York. De Long returned to Juniata in mid-August, having found no trace of the Polaris crew—who had meanwhile been rescued by the Scottish whaler SS Ravenscraig—but the experience had profoundly affected his outlook. Having earlier described the Greenland coast in a letter to his wife Emma as \\"a dreary land of desolation ... I hope I may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place\\", he returned home captivated by the Arctic. Emma wrote: \\"The polar virus was in his blood and would not let him rest\\".The abortive Little Juniata mission brought De Long to public notice, and he saw himself as a possible leader of the next U.S. Arctic expedition. He approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions. Grinnell was not prepared to offer financial support, instead advising De Long to approach James Gordon Bennett Jr., owner and publisher of the New York Herald and a known sponsor of bold schemes. De Long met Bennett in New York early in 1874; the newspaperman was impressed by De Long, and assured him that his Arctic ambitions would have the enthusiastic support of the Herald. In the meantime De Long had applied to the Navy Department for an Arctic command, a request that he was informed would \\"receive due attention\\"., what would be the answer ?

Write an article that answers the following question: Who threw the only touchdown pass from over 70 yards?","completion":"Title: A Story of the Longest Touchdown Pass Ever Hello, little friends! Today, we are going to tell you an amazing story about a very special football player. This player did something that no other player in history has ever done before. Are you ready? Let's start! Once upon a time in a land called the United States, there were many people who loved to play a game called football. In this game, the players would try to score points by carrying, throwing, or kicking a ball called a \\"pigskin\\" into their opponent's \\"end zone.\\" This was a fun and exciting game that many, many people liked to watch. Now, in this magical game of football, there are special moments called \\"touchdowns.\\" A touchdown is when the team with the ball (also called the \\"offense\\") manages to get the pigskin into the other team's end zone. When this happens, everybody on the scoring team feels super happy because they get 6 points! One sunny day, during an exciting game, a player named Patrick Mahomes did something extraordinary. Patrick was the quarterback for a team called the Kansas City Chiefs. Do you know what a quarterback is? A quarterback is like the leader of the offense. Their job is to throw the pigskin to other players on their team, who then try to run into the end zone for a touchdown. Patrick Mahomes, who is also called \\"Patty Magic\\" sometimes, was really good at being a quarterback. On this special day, he did something that nobody had ever done before. He threw the pigskin over 70 yards down the field, which is almost as long as your whole neighborhood! The pigskin flew through the air like a rocket and landed right in the hands of his friend Tyreek Hill. Tyreek caught the ball and ran super fast into the end zone. This magical play by Patrick Mahomes ended up being a touchdown pass longer than any other in football history. Everybody was amazed that someone could throw a football that far! And so, the tale of Patrick Mahomes and his 70-yard touchdown pass went down in football history. As of today, no other player has ever managed to throw such a looooong touchdown pass again. Isn't it just amazing what people can do when they practice and believe in themselves? Next time you see a football game, remember the story of Patrick Mahomes and his incredible 70-yard touchdown pass. It's an amazing example of what can happen when you work hard, believe in yourself, and dream big! The End."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: At which temperature will more water be available on the cupcakes for bacterial growth? A:","completion":"At 10° F, more water will be available on the cupcakes for bacterial growth as compared to 0° F. Freezing food is an effective method to preserve it as it slows down the growth of microorganisms, such as bacteria, mold, and yeast, which cause spoilage and spoil food quality. These microorganisms need water to survive and grow, so the amount of available water in food plays a crucial role in determining the rate at which these microorganisms will grow. To understand why there will be more available water on the cupcakes at 10° F as compared to 0° F, it is essential to discuss the concept of water activity. Water activity (aw) is a measure of the amount of available water in a substance, which is not bound to other molecules and is thus free to support microbial growth. The water activity scale ranges between 0 to 1, where 0 represents an absence of available water, and 1 represents pure water. The higher the aw value, the more water is available for microorganisms to grow. When Robert freezes the cupcakes, the water within the cupcakes starts to form ice crystals. As the temperature decreases, more ice will form and reduce the water activity. When the cupcakes are stored at 0° F, a temperature lower than 10° F, more water will freeze into ice crystals, and the water activity will be lower. Consequently, a higher portion of the water in the cupcakes will be bound up in ice crystals, leaving less unbound water available to support bacterial growth. On the other hand, when the cupcakes are kept at 10° F, which is slightly warmer than 0° F, less water will be bound up in ice crystals. This means that more water molecules will still be unbound and available for bacterial growth, even though the overall growth rate will still be significantly slower compared to if the cupcakes were kept at room temperature. In summary, storing the cupcakes at 0° F will result in the formation of more ice crystals within the cupcakes, thus lowering the water activity and making less water available for bacterial growth compared to storing them at 10° F."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let the ball sit there for a second or two, as your hand needs to be stationary, or still, before you throw it up into the air. Any illegal serve can result in the official calling it “incorrect.” While you may be warned one time during a match or if the official is unsure if the serve is legal, any clearly incorrect serves will lead your opponent to get your points! The hand holding the ball (which will become your “free hand”) has to be above the table as you get ready to serve. The ball itself should remain behind the end of the table (your serve line). Your thumb can cross the serve line as long as the ball itself doesn’t. Unlike the ball, your racket can be hidden under the table. Doing this may help you hide the kind of serve you’re going to make. You’ll need to quickly bring your racket up once you throw the ball into the air to get ready to serve. Until you’ve practiced serving, leave your racket hand above the table. This tricky technique is legal, but it’s best reserved for more advanced players. This is the minimum height required by the officials. Any lower and it won’t be counted as a legal serve. The ball needs to be thrown up vertically rather than sideways or diagonally. Make sure that your throw makes the ball go almost straight up into the air. You can’t, for example, just drop the ball from a height of 6.3 inches (16 cm). This won’t be considered a vertical toss. Don’t hit the ball when it’s still going up in the air or when it’s at the top of your throw. Wait until it’s coming back down toward the table to avoid getting called out by the official. Hit the ball so that it lands on your side first. If it just sails over the net without bouncing, it’s an illegal serve. Practice until you get the proper amount of force needed to follow this rule. You want a serve that’s fast enough to trick your opponent, but not so strong that it misses your side of the table. The ball can also go around the net so long as you can curve it enough to get it back onto your opponent’s side of the table. This is a pretty difficult skill, so aim straight over the net until you’re sure you can make a curving serve. Your opponent’s whole side is fair game if it’s just the two of you. This lets you really use the table. You can do short and long serves to make the match more difficult for your opponent. You’re restricted to the square that’s diagonal from you if you’re playing with partners. Anything that hits outside this square is illegal. It’s illegal to “hide” the the ball from the official or your opponent with your hand once you’ve served. Pull your free hand all the way back so you don’t get accused of doing this. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about how to do a legal serve in a game like table tennis.

Write an article based on this summary: Group accessories in threes. Vary the heights and sizes of your accessories. Use your decorations to draw your eye through the room. Use trays to organize accessories. Aim for symmetry with more than 1 table.","completion":"Title: The Art of Accessorizing: Grouping, Varying, and Organizing for a Visually Compelling Space Introduction: A well-decorated room is a blend of form and function. It should not only look visually appealing but also be functional and comfortable. One of the key aspects of creating a visually compelling space is accessorizing. Grouping, varying, and organizing accessories are essential steps in achieving the desired aesthetic. In this article, we will discuss how to group in threes, vary the height and size of your accessories, use decorations to draw the eye through the room, utilize trays for organization, and aim for symmetry when dealing with multiple tables. Section 1: Grouping Accessories in Threes Grouping accessories in odd numbers, specifically threes, can create a visually appealing focal point on surfaces such as shelves, mantels, or tables. This design principle is rooted in the concept that asymmetrical arrangements are more casual and dynamic, contributing to a more visually interesting space. When placing your accessories in groups of three, consider incorporating pieces with varying materials, shapes, or textures to add further depth and interest to the display. Section 2: Varying the Heights and Sizes When accessorizing, it's essential to vary the heights and sizes of the decorative elements. Doing so provides a sense of movement and makes the décor appear more balanced and dynamic. To achieve this, mix taller accent pieces like vases or lamps with shorter, more compact items such as books or candles. Additionally, incorporating various widths and shapes can add more visual intrigue while preventing the space from appearing too uniform and predictable. Section 3: Drawing the Eye Through the Room Using accessories strategically can help guide the eye through the room, promoting a smooth flow and highlighting focal points. Achieve this by placing larger, eye-catching pieces in more prominent areas while smaller objects can be used to fill in empty spaces without overwhelming the viewer. Implementing a cohesive color scheme can also help direct the eye from one accessory to the next and create a sense of unity and harmony throughout the space. Section 4: Using Trays for Organization Trays are not only functional for organizing items like remote controls, keys, and other small items, but when styled correctly, they can also serve as an elegant accessory in your décor. Using trays on surfaces like coffee tables, ottomans, and dining tables can anchor the display, making it feel grounded and intentional. To style a tray effectively, incorporate a variety of elements that provide visual interest. Mix decorative items like small sculptures, candles, and greenery with more practical objects such as coasters or books for a chic yet functional arrangement. Section 5: Aiming for Symmetry When accessorizing with multiple tables in a room, it's crucial to create a sense of symmetry and balance. This can be achieved by mirroring the arrangements of items on each table or using color-coordinated accessories to establish cohesion. For example, if you're decorating a pair of nightstands in a bedroom, consider using matching lamps, picture frames, or alarm clocks to provide a harmonious, symmetrical appearance. Conclusion: Accessorizing is an essential component of interior design, but it doesn't have to be complicated. By focusing on grouping in threes, varying the heights and sizes of your accessories, using decorations to draw the eye through the room, utilizing trays for organization, and aiming for symmetry, you can create a visually compelling space that reflects your personal style and enhances the overall ambiance of your home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer based on context: War between Phillip II's possessions and other countries led to a deterioration of Portugal's Empire, as with the loss of Hormuz to England, but the Dutch Empire was the main beneficiary. The VOC began immediately to prise away the string of coastal fortresses that, at the time, comprised the Portuguese Empire. The settlements were isolated, difficult to reinforce if attacked, and prone to being picked off one by one, but nevertheless the Dutch only enjoyed mixed success in its attempts to do so. Amboina was captured from the Portuguese in 1605, but an attack on Malacca the following year narrowly failed in its objective to provide a more strategically located base in the East Indies with favorable monsoon winds. The Dutch found what they were looking for in Jakarta, conquered by Jan Coen in 1619, later renamed Batavia after the putative Dutch ancestors the Batavians, and which would become the capital of the Dutch East Indies. Meanwhile, the Dutch continued to drive out the Portuguese from their bases in Asia. Malacca finally succumbed in 1641 , Colombo in 1656, Ceylon in 1658, Nagappattinam in 1662 and Cranganore and Cochin in 1662. Goa, the capital of the Portuguese Empire in the East, was unsuccessfully attacked by the Dutch in 1603 and 1610. Whilst the Dutch were unable in four attempts to capture Macau from where Portugal monopolized the lucrative China-Japan trade, the Japanese shogunate's increasing suspicion of the intentions of the Catholic Portuguese led to their expulsion in 1639. Under the subsequent sakoku policy, from 1639 till 1854 the Dutch were the only European power allowed to operate in Japan, confined in 1639 to Hirado and then from 1641 at Deshima.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.

When in 1648 the Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War, the parties agreed that the prince-bishoprics of Bremen and Verden were to become dominions of Sweden. The peace treaty had been prepared at a congress throughout the final years of the war. During the negotiations, several mostly Hanseatic cities requested that they become Imperial cities, with only Bremen being successful: Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor accepted Bremen as a Free imperial city in 1646. A respective document was signed in Linz on 1 June, with the aim of preventing Sweden from gaining the city. In turn Bremen, among other concessions, paid about 100.000 talers. Owing to Swedish diplomatic efforts however, the text of the 1648 treaty did not determine whether or not Bremen was to be included in the future Swedish dominion. The Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, northerly and easterly neighbouring the city's territory, had been occupied by Sweden since 1646/47. Swedish forces had then expelled the forces of Prince-Archbishop Frederick II, Prince of Denmark, officiating from 1637 to 1648. On 18 February 1647, the emperor accepted Sweden's annexation of the prince-archbishopric's territory as a secularized duchy.

The midfielder's left-footed shot from just outside the box went in via both posts, the ball rolling across the goal-line before spinning in. Rovers were value for a bigger winning margin, but made hard work of beating a Swindon side, who barely managed a worthwhile effort on goal. Matt Taylor hit the crossbar with a 77th-minute shot from outside the box but the hosts almost paid for not making their dominance tell when late shots from Ben Gladwin and John Goddard were both deflected just wide. Rovers created all the decent chances in the first half. An early Chris Lines free-kick was saved at the second attempt by Lawrence Vigouroux, who then produced a better save to keep out Bodin's close-range shot. Centre-back Ryan Sweeney almost marked an impressive Rovers debut with a goal on 16 minutes, but Gladwin cleared his header off the line. After Bodin's goal, Ellis Harrison's header was cleared off the line by Raphael Rossi-Branco and the interval was reached without Rovers keeper Joe Lumley making a save.

The game's decisive moment came from a left-footed shot by a midfielder just outside the box, which eventually spun in after hitting both posts. Despite dominating the game and creating most of the promising chances, Bristol Rovers struggled to increase the winning margin. Swindon Town had rare late attempts but failed to make an impact. The first half saw Bristol Rovers' keeper, Joe Lumley, go untested, and Rovers' debutant Ryan Sweeney almost scored but had his header cleared off the line.

During that time the students live in the wilderness and go through many physical activities of ever increasing difficulty. The first few days are given to physical conditioning and to the teaching of basic skills such as first aid, map and compass reading, rope climbing, and other similar activities. During the second part of the course students learn how to climb rocks and cliffs, how to use canoes and rafts in swift water, and in some schools how to sail, ski, climb mountains, and make long-distance hikes. The first two parts of the course are done in groups. Members work together and help each other to overcome the increasing number of challenges. In the third part of the course, students are sent out alone for three days to survive in the wilderness with only a few necessities. Who are the students of Outward Bound? They are both young people and adults, men and women. The minimum age is 16.5 years. There is no maximum age. About one-third of the 6,000 persons completing the course each year are women. Businessmen, housewives, university students, professors, doctors, and lawyers are among those taking part in the course. In recent years special courses for the busy business managers have gained in popularity. These courses last from five to ten days rather than the usual three to four weeks of the normal course. Not all students complete the Outward Bound course. In some cases the individual cannot meet the physical challenges. In its own words Outward Bound literature says: \\"Make no mistake, Outward Bound is not for everybody. The courses aren't easy and are not meant to be.\\" Most students who finish the course share a common experience. They are surprised at themselves that they finish the course and they feel great pride in doing the impossible! The Outward Bound experience makes them feel that they are better than they know!

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. Now, I have a new situation: Italy and Greece attended the World Ecological Conference. they were looking for solutions to improve their environment. Italy's air was very polluted, while Greece had problems with drought. Answer this question please: Which country had fewer problems with acid rain? A:","completion":"Based on the information you provided, Greece likely had fewer problems with acid rain as compared to Italy. Acid rain primarily results from the presence of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air, which are released from coal-fired power plants and motor vehicle exhaust, respectively. In your situation, Italy is described as having highly polluted air. This pollution could very likely be due to industries such as coal-fired power plants and high vehicular emissions, increasing the content of sulfur and nitrogen oxides in the air, which ultimately lead to the formation of acid rain. On the other hand, Greece is described as having a problem with drought. Drought refers to a lack of precipitation over an extended period, often causing a deficiency in water supply. Drought conditions could imply that there is less rainfall overall, and hence lesser likelihood of acid rain occurring on account of reduced precipitation. However, it is essential to note that the exact levels of acid rain would depend on multiple factors including but not limited to the level and type of industrial activity, the vehicular emission norms, atmospheric conditions, geography, and the effectiveness of environmental regulations in place in each country. Therefore, while this answer is informed speculation based on the provided context, real-world data would need to be analyzed for a definitive answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Research the 4th dimension The 4th dimension is an abstract concept that can have different interpretations depending on the context in which it's discussed. In physics, the 4th dimension is often considered as time, making up the four-dimensional spacetime fabric of our reality, where three dimensions are spatial and one is temporal. However, in other theories or discussions, the 4th dimension can also be considered as a spatial dimension beyond our familiar three-dimensional world.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others.

Irving Grant Thalberg (May 30, 1899 - September 14, 1936) was an American film producer during the early years of motion pictures. He was called \\"The Boy Wonder\\" for his youth and ability to select scripts, choose actors, gather production staff, and make profitable films, including Grand Hotel, China Seas, Camille, Mutiny on the Bounty, and The Good Earth. His films carved out an international market, \\"projecting a seductive image of American life brimming with vitality and rooted in democracy and personal freedom,\\" states biographer Roland Flamini. He found work as an office secretary at Universal Pictures' New York office, and later became personal secretary to the studio's founder and president, Carl Laemmle. Among Thalberg's duties were transcribing and editing notes that Laemmle had written during screenings of his films. He earned 25 weekly, becoming adept at making insightful observations, which impressed Laemmle. Laemmle took Thalberg to see his Los Angeles production facility, where he spent a month watching how movie production worked. Before returning to New York, Laemmle told Thalberg to remain and \\"keep an eye on things for me.\\" Two months later, Laemmle returned to California, partly to see how well Thalberg was able to handle the responsibilities he was given. Thalberg gave him suggestions, which impressed Laemmle by his ability to understand and explain problems. Thalberg suggested, \\"The first thing you should do is establish a new job of studio manager and give him the responsibility of watching day-to-day operations.\\" Laemmle immediately agreed, \\"All right. You're it.\\" In shock, Thalberg replied, \\"I'm what?\\" Laemmle told him to take charge of the Los Angeles studio, which he did in early 1919. At age 20, Thalberg became responsible for immediately overseeing the nine ongoing film productions and nearly thirty scenarios then under development. In describing the rationale for this early appointment as studio manager, film historian David Thomson writes that his new job \\"owed nothing to nepotism, private wealth, or experience in the film industry.\\" He reasons that despite \\"Thalberg's youth, modest education, and frail appearance . . . it is clear that he had the charm, insight, and ability, or the appearance of it, to captivate the film world.\\" Thalberg was one among the majority of Hollywood film industry workers who migrated from the East Coast, primarily from New York. Some film actors, such as Conrad Nagel, did not like the 5-day train trip or the sudden warmth of the California climate. Neither did Marion Davies, who was not used to such \\"big wide spaces.\\" Samuel Marx, a close friend of Thalberg's from New York, recalled how easily Thalberg adapted to Southern California, often standing outside his doorway during moments of contemplation to enjoy the scenery. \\"We were all young,\\" said comedian Buster Keaton. \\"The air in California was like wine. Our business was also young--and growing like nothing ever seen before.\\" Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Who was Irving Grant Thalberg and what was his contribution to the film industry?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Anzhi chaos could send Samuel Eto'o falling into José Mourinho's arms Samuel Eto'o and José Mourinho won the Champions League at Internazionale and might relish a reunion at Chelsea. Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images There were two big stories in Belarus in the last week of July. On the plus side, their premier, Alexander Lukashenko caught a catfish bigger than the pike Vladimir Putin had landed in Siberia a few days earlier. More difficult to comprehend, though, was the news that Uralkali, a Russian firm run by Suleiman Kerimov, had broken off a business agreement with a Belarusian company that effectively fixed global potash prices. It's hard to say precisely what the consequences will be, but pressure has already been placed on the Belarusian rouble, while a surge in the supply of potash should lead to a decrease in the cost of fertiliser (and thus perhaps food). It could also lead to the sale of Samuel Eto'o to Chelsea. Quite why Uralkali have ended what was effectively a cartel is unclear, but in the day that followed the announcement, £5.5bn was wiped off the company's stock market valuation, with Kerimov himself losing an estimated £325m. The share price has since recovered and a direct link between the end of the agreement and what is going on at Anzhi Makhachkala has been denied, but that Uralkali felt compelled to take such a drastic step hints at the turbulence behind the scenes. What has happened at Anzhi is a warning to all clubs who rely on external investment. The club, which had been founded in 1991, had worked its way into the Russian top flight when, in January 2011, it was taken over by Kerimov. He was born in Derbent in Dagestan and studied accounting and economics at Dagestan State University and has always insisted he took over the club for reasons of local pride, although it's no secret that Putin encourages oligarchs to invest in sporting ventures as a way of returning some of their wealth to the people. Kerimov's investment in a club in such a troubled region fitted exactly into Putin's more general policy of decentralisation. There has been a conscious attempt, in all spheres, to reach out to the regions and it is no coincidence that after years of Moscow domination, there were five Russian champions in a row from outside the capital before CSKA's success last year. Anzhi, despite eyebrow-raising deals to sign Roberto Carlos, Eto'o and Christopher Samba, and the appointment of Guus Hiddink as manager, never really threatened to join Zenit St Petersburg or Rubin Kazan on the provincial roll of honour. So Kerimov did what oligarchs usually do and spent some more. Around £50m was invested this summer, bringing the Russia captain Igor Denisov from Zenit, Aleksandr Kokorin from Dynamo Moscow and Samba back from Queens Park Rangers. Hiddink left to be replaced by René Meulensteen, who had limited experience as a No1 but who had gained a glowing reputation in his time at Manchester United. The season, though, began badly. Anzhi took two points from their first four games. Denisov, a fine player but never the easiest character, fought with Eto'o and Lassana Diarra on the training pitch and was exiled to train alone, with rumours he could be sold to Dynamo. And then, last week, came the shock announcement that Kerimov was changing tack, slashing the club's budget from £116m per season (second only to Zenit in Russia) to between £32m and £45m. It was portrayed initially as though Kerimov had grown tired of squabbling stars and was choosing to switch philosophy and start focusing on youth development – which even for a capricious oligarch would have been a bizarrely whimsical response to a few bad results at the start of the season. Clearly there are deeper reasons. Kerimov's spokesman has insisted that rumours the 47-year-old is in ill health are unfounded but it's hard not to see significance in the fact that the announcement of Anzhi's budget cut came just a week after the end of the Uralkali deal with Belarus that guaranteed a steady stream of income. In practical terms, a £35m budget should still be enough for Anzhi to challenge for European places, but it has meant the end for Meulensteen, laid off after 16 turbulent days in the job (presumably soon to be the subject of a David Peace-Danny Boyle collaboration, 28 Days Shorter), and it also means that the highest-paid stars are likely to be offloaded. The querulous Denisov, who spent a substantial part of last season training with Zenit's youth team after protesting against the signings of Hulk and Axel Witsel, will surely go, and so too will Eto'o, who had previously demonstrated a clear reluctance to work for Gadzhi Gadzhiev, who has returned to the club to replace Meulensteen. Eto'o's move to Russia has meant him disappearing from view in western Europe, and leading to the widespread assumption that he is over the hill. He certainly is not quite the player he was three or four years ago, but at 32 he still has much to offer, the intelligence that always underlays his game beginning to emerge as his pace diminishes. He has a year left on his contract so presumably wouldn't be overly expensive, although he would probably have to accept a pay cut to move to the Premier League and the fact his world record salary was paid in full in advance complicates matters. Chelsea's interest in the forward is logical. The courting of Wayne Rooney suggested José Mourinho wasn't happy with his striking options – Fernando Torres, Demba Ba and Romelu Lukaku – and he has worked successfully with Eto'o before. The Cameroon striker himself makes no secret of his admiration for Mourinho and perhaps fancies one final crack with a major western European team. And if agreement can be reached on wages, it may be that, for all Lukashenko's and Putin's angling exploits, it's Mourinho who ends up landing the really big fish. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"In this story, there is a big, rich company that was helping a soccer team called Anzhi with a lot of money. But now, the company had some trouble and doesn't have as much money as before. So, they are giving less money to the soccer team. Because of this, the team might have to sell many of their famous players. One of these players is called Samuel Eto'o, and he might go to another team called Chelsea. The coach of Chelsea, José Mourinho, likes Samuel Eto'o and wants him in the team. If they can agree on how much money Samuel Eto'o will be paid, he might join Chelsea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a news article: AFP People atttend a mass in the Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral on November 29, 2012, in Paris For nearly half a century, French Catholics have been reciting a version of the Lord's Prayer that could be considered blasphemous, the country's bishops have concluded after years of debate. In a ruling long advocated by traditionalists and with implications for other-language versions of the prayer, the bishops have approved a new edition of the French-language bible which will include a revised wording of one of the prayer's best-known lines, \\"Lead us not into temptation.\\" The existing French version of that line reads, \\"Et ne nous soumets pas à la tentation\\", which translates as \\"Do not submit us to temptation.\\" This has long been controversial because of the possibility of interpreting it in a way that suggests God has the power to make people succumb to the temptation of sin -- contradicting most orthodox Christian theology which holds that He is infinitely and unchangeably good. In the revised formulation, to be included in new bibles published on November 22, the line will read \\"Et ne nous laisse pas entrer en tentation\\" or \\"Let us not enter into temptation.\\" The change was authorised by the Vatican in July along with the rest of a new translation of the bible into French from the original texts, which were written in a number of different languages. The task, involving 70 linguistic and theological experts, has taken 17 years to complete. The current version of the Lord's Prayer has been used in France since 1966. Ironically, the disputed wording was the result of an attempt to agree on a common version for both Catholic and Protestant churches. France's small Protestant congregations however never adopted the phrase, opting instead for \\"Let us not enter into temptation.\\" Date created : 2013-10-15 ||||| France 's Catholic Church has finally corrected a \\"blasphemous\\" error that crept into the Gallic version of The Lord's prayer half a century ago. After a 17-year debate, theologians and writers concluded that the French equivalent of \\"And lead us not into temptation\\" implied that God Himself could lead us astray, rather than help us keep on the straight and narrow, and thus had \\"blasphemous\\" overtones. The French line before read: \\"And don't submit us to temptation\\". It now reads: \\"And don't let us enter into temptation\\". The change will be incorporated into a new French translation of the Bible validated by the Vatican that will be published next month. Traditionalists were appalled when the unfortunate wording was introduced in 1966, as according to father Frédéric Louzeau, a theologian, it suggested that: \\"God, who is infinitely good and the source of all goodness, could drive man to evil or sin\\". Le Figaro, France's main conservative daily, said the consequences of the poor translation on \\"millions of Catholics\\" was \\"incalculable\\". The \\"error\\" was due to an ecumenical compromise between Orthodox Christians and reformed Protestants to create a \\"common Lord's Prayer\\". The resulting text came in the wake of the Second Vatican Council of 1965, which sought to address relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the modern world. The French Protestant version of the Bible modified the phrase at the time. The new translation will be presented during the forthcoming plenary assembly of French bishops at Lourdes. However, it will not be used in French parishes until the changes are incorporated into the latest Roman Missal – not before 2015. \\"We'll have to explain it to our congregation. Even the priest will get it wrong,\\" Father Scheffels, priest in Nanterre, west of Paris, told Le Parisien. Eric Denimal, a theologian, told the newspaper that believers should not worry about having said the wrong thing for the past half century. \\"Whatever way the phrase is pronounced, what counts ultimately is the authenticity of the relationship between the person praying and the God he is addressing,\\" he said. The Lord's Prayer is a central prayer in Christianity also commonly known as the Our Father and in Latin as the Pater Noster. In the New Testament, it appears a longer form in the Gospel of Matthew as part of the Sermon on the Mount, and a shorter form in the Gospel of Luke, as a response by Jesus to a request by \\"one of his disciples\\" to teach them \\"to pray as John taught his disciples\\". The prayer concludes with \\"deliver us from evil\\" in Matthew, and with \\"lead us not into temptation\\" in Luke. The Anglican version ends in: \\"For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The Catholic Church in France has corrected a \\"blasphemous\\" error in the French version of the Lord's Prayer that was introduced 50 years ago.

Which stores more energy, a smaller flywheel or a larger flywheel? Why don't electric cars use flywheels if they have a virtually infinite energy density? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose from: [+] no. [+] yes.","completion":"[+] no. The two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They ask about different aspects of flywheel energy storage systems. The first question asks about the energy storage capacity of a smaller flywheel compared to a larger flywheel, while the second question asks why electric cars do not use flywheels for energy storage given their seemingly infinite energy density. I will now answer both questions separately. 1. Which stores more energy, a smaller flywheel or a larger flywheel? A larger flywheel will typically store more energy than a smaller one. The energy stored in a flywheel is determined by the equation: E = 0.5 * I * ω^2 where E is the stored energy, I is the moment of inertia, and ω is the angular velocity or speed of rotation (in radians per second). The moment of inertia depends on the mass distribution in the flywheel – the more mass concentrated at a larger radius from the axis of rotation, the greater the moment of inertia. Broadly speaking, a larger flywheel will have a higher moment of inertia because it will have more mass distributed at a greater distance from the axis of rotation. This results in a larger flywheel generally having a greater ability to store energy compared to a smaller flywheel. However, it should be noted that the design and materials used in constructing the flywheel can also influence its energy storage capacity—more advanced and lightweight materials can increase the energy storage capability of a smaller flywheel. 2. Why don't electric cars use flywheels if they have a virtually infinite energy density? While flywheels do have excellent energy storage capabilities, they are not typically used in electric cars due to a number of challenges: a. Complexity: Flywheels require precise engineering, high-quality bearings, and sophisticated control systems to maintain stability and efficiency. These complexities can increase the overall cost and difficulty of integrating a flywheel system into an electric vehicle. b. Size and weight: Although flywheels can be made compact and lightweight, having a large enough flywheel to store sufficient energy for an electric car might increase the overall weight and size of the vehicle, negatively impacting its performance and efficiency. c. Limited energy storage: Contrary to the term \\"virtually infinite energy density,\\" flywheels have limited energy storage capacity. When compared to lithium-ion batteries, flywheels have lower energy density, and they can only store energy for a short period of time before the energy dissipates due to factors such as friction and air resistance. d. Safety concerns: Flywheels store energy in rotational motion, and any failure in the containment system can lead to a catastrophic release of energy in the form of uncontrolled motion. This poses potential safety risks for electric car passengers. e. Energy loss: Flywheels face energy losses due to friction and air resistance. Some flywheels have to be kept in vacuum-sealed enclosures to reduce such losses, which in turn increases the complexity, cost, and size of the system. Thus, electric cars currently prefer lithium-ion batteries or other energy storage systems due to their simplicity, superior energy density, and safety compared to flywheel energy storage systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: The San Francisco branch of the Federal Reserve has a game on its website that lets you play at being Chair of the Federal Reserve. After tinkering with it, I've come to some conclusions: Modeling the economy is a mug's game, short-term interest rates are a poor tool for steering the economy, and I should never be given the job of running a central bank. The website sets out the objectives: Your job is to set monetary policy to achieve full employment and low price inflation. Your term will last four years (16 quarters). Keep unemployment close to its natural rate of 5 percent. Keep inflation near the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. Pay attention to the headlines for information about the economy. The game begins in mid-2020 with the kind of Goldilocks economy that any incoming central bank chief would happily trade their housing allowance for. Inflation is not too hot and not too cold, at 2.1 percent, a level the current Fed hasn't enjoyed for more than two years. Unemployment has been ticking lower for five consecutive quarters and is just 4.7 percent, a smidgen below the 5 percent level that the game says is the \\"natural\\" rate and in line with today's 4.9 percent number. But the benchmark Fed funds rate has remained constant at 4 percent throughout that imagined future period -- a far cry from the current upper bound of 0.5 percent. So what's an incoming central bank chair to do? Leave well enough alone, of course. Luckily, there are no pesky dissenters to worry about in my monetary dictatorship, no gravitational pull from a zero bound that I'm philosophically anxious to escape, and so my decision to leave rates on hold is unchallenged. The following quarter sees the jobless rate inch down to 4.6 percent, while inflation speeds up a bit to 2.3 percent. Neither seem particularly worrisome -- because consumer price gains were below the Fed target throughout 2015 and 2016, letting them off the leash for a while seems defensible -- so I'll do what the Fed did last week in the real world and keep rates unchanged again. \\"Help Wanted Signs Everywhere,\\" say the resulting news headlines. \\"Tight job market suggests more inflation ahead.\\" Inflation speeds up to 2.5 percent, while the jobless rate drops to 4.4 percent. Should being so far below the so-called natural jobless rate bother me, the way the labor market seems to currently preoccupy Yellen? Well, in March 2014, the Fed abandoned the idea that a decline below 6.5 percent would be enough to trigger higher borrowing costs. Unemployment has been below 6 percent since October 2014, and yet the Fed has only tweaked its rate higher once, with the current 4.9 percent level not enough to spur action this month. So, in the game, I stick with that playbook, and keep rates on hold for my third consecutive quarter. In fact, in recognition of the challenge that being \\"data dependent\\" is meaningless if you start ignoring the data when it doesn't do what you expect, I'm planning to stand pat on policy all the way until the middle of 2021. The game tries to interfere with my plans, throwing out what it says is a tax refund for millions of people. (It might instead have had the government taking advantage of stable borrowing costs to boost infrastructure spending, but it seems that much-needed approach is too much to hope for even in fantasy land.) Could this be helicopter money, conjured out of thin air by the central bank rather than coming from existing central government funds? I don't remember authorizing that! The game doesn’t say; but with inflation surging past 3.3 percent and the jobless rate down to close to 3 percent, the economic temperature is definitely rising. Back in July 2009, when the current Fed chair Janet Yellen was merely head of the San Francisco branch, she said keeping rates near zero for several years was \\"not outside the realm of possibility.\\" Thus it proved. Yellen took charge of the Fed in Feb. 2014; she didn't oversee her first rate change until December 2015. So, taking my cue from her, I ignore the game's September 2021 newspaper headlines \\"Fed Expected to Tighten to Restrain Economy,\\" even as consumer price gains rocket past 4.4 percent. By the time I'm willing to entertain a rate increase in March 2022 after 20 months at the helm, it's probably too late. Unemployment is 1.5 percent, and has been for months -- the game seems to believe it's impossible for it to drop below that lower bound. Inflation, though, is at a pace not seen since the early 1980s, nudging 7 percent. \\"Economy Too Hot!\\" says the newspaper. \\"Uncontrolled Economic Boom Signals Trouble.\\" The paper is almost definitely preparing my obituary as Fed chief. Suppose I govern differently from the beginning. It turns out that life's not much better if I start my term by immediately driving the Fed funds rate down to its current 0.5 percent level. Unemployment quickly drops to that 1.5 percent floor, while inflation surges past 4.4 percent. And no matter how many times I click on the \\"Cut\\" button, the game won't let me introduce the negative interest rates prevalent in so many of the world's monetary jurisdictions. In a virtual sense, I'm unique in having served two online terms as Internet Fed chair. I'm no better at it than I was at the start of 2008, when I played the Fed's virtual game using Ben Bernanke's playbook as my guide. Then, a Fed funds level of 1 percent -- back before ZIRP and NIRP were even a gleam in the eyes of unconventional economists -- was enough to drive inflation to double-digit crisis levels. (Soon after the article I wrote then was published, the game disappeared from the Internet. I've only just rediscovered it.) The game's changes suggest that the experience of the past decade has changed how economists view the interaction between policy and outcomes. I draw three conclusions from my experience running the Fed in a virtual world. Firstly, modeling is bunkum, because the real world has so many variables that aren't interacting the way economics textbooks say they should. At no point does the Fed's admittedly simplistic web game tell us what growth is doing, or how wages are performing relative to inflation. Whichever model a central bank employs will always be an imperfect snapshot of the economy. And the growing debate, fueled in part by Fed officials themselves, about whether inflation targets need to be higher, what the true non-accelerating rate of inflation is, and whether targeting gross domestic product makes more sense, illustrates how hard it is to choose what to target. Secondly, central banks cannot and should not be expected to do all of the work; there's only so much monetary policy can achieve to resuscitate growth without parallel action on the fiscal front from government. The Bank of Japan's decision last week to shift its focus to keeping 10-year yields from dropping below zero percent suggests the typical central bank focus on short-term borrowing costs ignores the effect on the banking industry of longer-term rates. And thirdly, I'm glad I'm not actually in charge of steering the global economy. I am increasingly sympathetic toward our central bankers; they may have more sophisticated tools than the simulator after embracing unconventional policies, but their jobs are still more difficult than most people imagine.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What group is the scientist able to link to the car bomb?, using the article: During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues. They go to Andrei's house where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is revealed to be Anatoly Grishin. While they are arguing, Komarov himself arrives and orders Grishin to kill Dorganosov., what would be the answer ?

New York (CNN) -- Three defendants pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to conspiring to defraud a Holocaust reparations organization out of 57.3 million, according to court documents. Genrikh Kolontyrskiy, Moysey Kucher and Dora Kucher, all of Brooklyn, helped produce and process some of the thousands of fraudulent applications for the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany that are under investigation. The organization, also known as the Claims Conference, distributes more than 400 million a year from funds provided by the German government to victims of the Holocaust. \\"Our efforts to hold to account all of the individuals who participated in defrauding an organization that exists solely for the purpose of aiding victims of Nazi atrocities continues,\\" said Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a statement. The defendants aided in defrauding two funds managed by the Claims Conference, the Article 2 Fund and the Hardship Fund, of 45 million and 12.3 million, respectively, according to court documents. The Article 2 Fund makes monthly payments of around 400 to survivors of Nazi persecution who make less than 16,000 per year \\"and either lived in hiding or under a false identity for at least 18 months,\\" according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's office.

On 29 March 2013 , Lancina left Cotonsport Garoua from Cameroon and signed for Bulgaria A Grupa side PFC Lokomotiv Sofia .","completion":"Yes, both sentences convey the same message, but with slightly different phrasing.

Sentence 1: \\"On 29 March 2013, Lancina Cotonsport left Garoua from Cameroon and signed a Grupa team PFC Lokomotiv Sofia for Bulgaria.\\" Sentence 2: \\"On 29 March 2013, Lancina left Cotonsport Garoua from Cameroon and signed for Bulgaria A Grupa side PFC Lokomotiv Sofia.\\" Both sentences contain the following main elements: 1. The date of the event: \\"On 29 March 2013\\" 2. The individual involved: \\"Lancina\\" 3. The departure from the previous club: \\"Cotonsport Garoua from Cameroon\\" 4. The signing with the new club: \\"PFC Lokomotiv Sofia\\" 5. The indication that the new club is in Bulgaria: \\"Bulgaria\\" 6. The classification of the new club: \\"A Grupa\\" or \\"Grupa team\\" Here are the differences between the two sentences: 1. In sentence 1, the person's full name \\"Lancina Cotonsport\\" is used, whereas in sentence 2, only the first name \\"Lancina\\" is used. This may cause some confusion as \\"Cotonsport\\" is the former team's name and not the person's last name. It would be clearer to separate the person's name and the team's name, as in sentence 2. 2. In sentence 1, the phrase \\"signed a Grupa team PFC Lokomotiv Sofia for Bulgaria\\" is used, which does not clearly mention the specific league in which the team participates. In sentence 2, the phrase \\"signed for Bulgaria A Grupa side PFC Lokomotiv Sofia\\" is used, which explicitly states the league as \\"A Grupa\\" and that \\"side\\" emphasizes that it is a team within that league. Thus, sentence 2 is more precise in conveying the details of the transfer. In conclusion, while both sentences essentially communicate the same information - Lancina's transfer from Cotonsport Garoua in Cameroon to PFC Lokomotiv Sofia in Bulgaria on 29 March 2013 - sentence 2 is clearer and more accurate in presenting the relevant details. It is always a good practice to adopt clear and concise language, especially when discussing events and providing information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: A lot of people choose to apply lemon juice overnight, incorporating it into their nightly face-washing routine. If you don't want to leave the lemon juice on overnight, try applying it right after you wash your face in the morning. Make sure your face is completely dry and moisturized before proceeding. Leave the Q-tip in the lemon wedge for a couple seconds for good measure. You should feel a bit of tingling on your skin, but it shouldn't hurt. Re-saturate the Q-tip in the lemon wedge as necessary. Only target your problem areas. How long you choose to leave the lemon juice on your skin probably depends on two things — whether you're targeting scars or acne, and how sensitive your skin is: Scars or acne? If you're trying to treat scars only, you have a little bit more leeway, because you're using the lemon juice to lighten skin, not heal acne. In this case, you can afford to leave it on for several hours to overnight. If you're treating acne, try leaving it on for less time. Sensitive skin or not? People with sensitive skin have a harder time leaving lemon juice on for longer periods. If your skin is very sensitive, reddens easily, or generally doesn't behave, stick with a couple hours at first before experimenting with longer durations. Apply the lemon juice every 1 - 3 days for a period of several weeks for best results. If lemon juice doesn't work, try seeing a dermatologist or consult other sources on treating acne fast and naturally.","completion":"Incorporating lemon juice application into one's skincare routine has been a popular choice for many people, especially for addressing problem areas such as acne and scars. Lemon juice can be applied either overnight as a part of one's nightly face-washing routine, or in the morning after washing the face, making sure the face is completely dry and moisturized before proceeding. To apply lemon juice, a Q-tip is typically used, which is left in the lemon wedge for a couple of seconds to absorb the juice. It is common to feel a tingling sensation on the skin during application, but it should not cause any pain. The Q-tip may require re-saturation with lemon juice as necessary, and it is essential to target only the problem areas on the skin. The duration of the lemon juice application on the skin depends on two factors: the type of skin issue being addressed (scars or acne), and the sensitivity of the skin. For those looking to treat scars, the lemon juice can be left on the skin for longer durations, such as several hours or even overnight, since its primary purpose is to lighten the skin. However, when treating acne, it is advised to leave the juice on for a shorter period. Skin sensitivity also plays a significant role in determining the application duration. Individuals with sensitive skin, which easily reddens or exhibits adverse reactions, should start with shorter applications of a couple of hours before gradually increasing the duration as needed. Applying lemon juice every 1 to 3 days over several weeks is recommended for the best results. However, if lemon juice does not yield satisfactory results or causes irritation, it is advised to consult a dermatologist or seek additional sources of information on treating acne naturally and quickly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: My high school life has been filled with many ups and downs, whether it was social or academic. Even though my current high school was not my first choice, I never regretted attending Southside High School. \\"Since you have chosen it, then it is the best for you,\\" said my parents. Up until the junior year I did not realize my capabilities as a student. Being in the IB Program, I was told that my junior year would be the toughest in all the years of high school. With this \\"little\\" piece of information, I walked into my junior year, scared of my grades. As weeks went by, I started to believe that the junior year was not as hard as everyone had said, but I was wrong. My grades were rapidly declining and by the end of the first term I had had five Cs in seven of my classes! I could not believe it --- I did not want to believe it. I tried my best to get my grades up myself without any help from anyone, but my pride just made my grades worse. And I had to miss out on one of the most important speech and debate competitions all year: States. I was heartbroken. I realized that I could not survive my junior year on my own, so I had to get help fast. Once I got a tutor, my grades went from Cs, Ds, and even some Fs, to nothing but As and Bs. I slowly started to gain my confidence back in all of my classes and even myself. By the time the third and fourth quarter came around, I had been on the honor roll twice, and I was receiving awards from speeches and debates, tennis and school. Southside has taught me to always keep my head up and never give up on myself no matter what life throws at me. I am proud to be a Southside Tiger.

I have a new situation: Two villages were focused mostly on mining operation. Brown village extracted fossil fuels such as coal from their mountains, while Yellow village was mostly focused on extracting gold the old fashioned way. But I can use this background: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. What is an answer for this question: Which village has more of an impact on Earth's temperature? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, the Brown village has more of an impact on Earth's temperature. Step 1: Understanding the contributions of each village - The Brown village extracts fossil fuels such as coal from their mountains. - The Yellow village is mostly focused on extracting gold. Step 2: Comparing each village's impact on the carbon cycle - The extraction and burning of fossil fuels from the Brown village releases more carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. - The Yellow village's gold extraction process does not involve a significant release of carbon dioxide. Step 3: Relating each village's impact to global warming or global climate change - The increased release of CO2 from the Brown village's fossil fuel extraction and use contributes to the greenhouse effect and global warming or global climate change. - The Yellow village's gold extraction has minimal, if any, direct impact on global warming or global climate change. In conclusion, the Brown village has more of an impact on Earth's temperature due to their focus on extracting and using fossil fuels, which releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming or global climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The film opens with several dynamite blasts to break up the ice that's clogging up the deep-sea drilling rigs. Disappointingly to the company, the drilling rig produces no oil. Baldwin is then picked up from work by an airplane flown by his wife Claudia. On the way home, Claudia tells Michael that she wants to move the kids back to Los Angeles where they can live in a more civilized environment. Michael argues that he cannot just walk away from the exploration since it was his idea. Upon arriving home, Michael and Claudia must deal with their three children arguing with each other about the existence of Santa Claus. To make matters worse for Michael, Murdock, portrayed as the stereotyped insensitive corporate boss, threatens to terminate his employment if the exploration does not produce results. The next day, Michael returns to his office, where he is met by Santa Claus's chief elf Ed.

You decide. Compared with 50 years ago, when I was just four years old, people now make nearly three times as much money, eat one third more food and expect to live one third longer. In fact, it's hard to find any areas of the world that's worse off now than it was then, even though the world population has more than doubled over that period. One reason we are richer, healthier, taller, cleverer, longer-lived and freer than ever before is that the four most basic human needs--food, clothing, fuel and shelter--have grown much cheaper. Take one example: In 1800, a candle providing one hour's light cost six hours' work. In the 1880s, the same light from a lamp took 15 minutes' work to pay for. In 1950, it was eight seconds. Today, it's half a second. In these terms, we are 43,200 times better off than in1800. In the United States, rivers, lakes, seas and air are getting cleaner all the time. A car today produces less pollution traveling at full speed than a parked car did from leaks in 1970. Although the world population is growing, the rate of increase has been falling for 50 years. Across the world, national birth rates are lower now than in 1960, and in the less developed world, the birth rate has almost halved. According to a research report from the United Nations, population will start falling once it reaches 9.2 billion in 2075. After all, there are already seven billion people on earth, and they are eating better and better. In 1970s, there were 550 billion barrels of oil reserves in the world, and in the 20 years that followed the world used up 600 billion. So by 1990, reserves should have been overused by 50 billion barrels. Instead, it is reported there are 900 billion today. They will last for many years and people will find something in place of oil long before they run out. The more we develop, the more we can... Question: Today, providing one hour's light costs _ .

Back in Paris with two years of his grant remaining, Bizet was temporarily secure financially and could ignore for the moment the difficulties that other young composers faced in the city. The two state-subsidised opera houses, the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique, each presented traditional repertoires that tended to stifle and frustrate new homegrown talent; only eight of the 54 Prix de Rome laureates between 1830 and 1860 had had works staged at the Opéra. Although French composers were better represented at the Opéra-Comique, the style and character of productions had remained largely unchanged since the 1830s. A number of smaller theatres catered for operetta, a field in which Offenbach was then paramount, while the Théâtre Italien specialised in second-rate Italian opera. The best prospect for aspirant opera composers was the Théâtre Lyrique company which, despite repeated financial crises, operated intermittently in various premises under its resourceful manager Léon Carvalho. This company had staged the first performances of Gounod's Faust and his Roméo et Juliette, and of a shortened version of Berlioz's Les Troyens.On 13 March 1861, Bizet attended the Paris premiere of Wagner's opera Tannhäuser, a performance greeted by audience riots that were stage-managed by the influential Jockey-Club de Paris. Despite this distraction, Bizet revised his opinions of Wagner's music, which he had previously dismissed as merely eccentric. He now declared Wagner \\"above and beyond all living composers\\". Thereafter, accusations of \\"Wagnerism\\" were often laid against Bizet, throughout his compositional career.As a pianist, Bizet had showed considerable skill from his earliest years. A contemporary asserted that he could have assured a future on the concert platform, but chose to conceal his talent \\"as though it were a vice\\". In May 1861 Bizet gave a rare demonstration of his virtuoso skills when, at a dinner party at which Liszt was present, he astonished everyone by playing on sight, flawlessly, one of the maestro's most...

Sentence 2: Teawurst was invented in the middle of the 19th century in Pomerania, probably in the small Baltic town of Rügenwalde (today Darłowo, Poland). Step 1: Compare the subject Both sentences are about the invention of a type of wurst (sausage). The first sentence refers to \\"Teewurst\\" and the second sentence to \\"Teawurst.\\" These are different spellings, but they might refer to the same type of sausage if it's assumed that it's a typo or an alternative spelling. Step 2: Compare the time of invention Both sentences mention that the invention happened in the middle of the 19th century. This information matches. Step 3: Compare the location of invention Both sentences mention the invention happening in the small Baltic town of Rügenwald (Rügenwalde). The difference lies in the description of the larger region. Sentence 1 says it was in Poland, with Rügenwald being in Pomerania today (Darłowo). Sentence 2 says it was in Pomerania, with Rügenwald being in Poland today (Darłowo). The difference in the location description can be attributed to historical changes in the region. Poland and Pomerania have had a complex history, with territory shifts over time. It seems that both sentences are describing the same location, acknowledging the historical context. Step 4: Conclusion Considering the steps above, it appears that both sentences convey the same information, although with slight differences in wording and structure. The apparent contradiction in the location description can be reconciled by understanding the region's historical context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If necessary, make a list of pros and cons for each so you can figure out which would be the best for you, considering all aspects of the representation and the potential relationship. Understand that cost is not your only concern, nor should it be your primary concern. You're dealing with the distribution of everything you've earned and accumulated over your entire life, so it's worth the investment to make sure it's done right. As you prepare to make your final decision, you may realize you didn't get all the information you needed at the interview. If that's the case, you shouldn't hesitate to call or email with follow-up questions so you can make a fully informed decision. If none of the prospects you interviewed feels completely like the right choice, you might want to go back to your long list and interview a few more attorneys until you find one you feel more comfortable with. Once you've made your decision one way or the other, let that attorney know rather than leaving her hanging. Even if you haven't decided who you want to hire, if there are attorneys you've interviewed who you definitely don't want to hire, go ahead and let them know. Before you pay your attorney any money, make sure you know exactly what she's going to do for you, how long it will take, and what documents she will draft. You also should make sure you understand the extra fees for any additional services that might come up while the attorney is working for you. Make sure there's a system in place for notifying you in advance if extra work must be done or if an issue pops up that needs to be dealt with but is outside the initial scope of the attorney's representation. For example, if you have no children when you initially consult with an estate planning attorney, find out what will happen if you have a son and need to incorporate him into your will or make arrangements for a guardian if you die before he turns 18. The written agreement should be signed both by you and your attorney. If you are expected to pay a retainer or other up-front fee for her services, she'll expect payment when the agreement is signed. If a retainer is required, make sure you know how much will be returned to you if you decide to go with someone else or abandon your plan before the attorney has finished his work.

Pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium, the sac-like membrane surrounding the heart, typically demands a multi-faceted treatment plan to reduce inflammation and manage pain. In Paul's case, the physician initially diagnosed the specific cause of his infection to determine the most suitable drugs, since Pericarditis can be triggered by a variety of factors, including viral or bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, kidney failure, or even certain cancer treatments. After careful review of Paul's medical records and current symptoms, which included chest pain that worsened when lying down and improved when leaning forward, mild fever, and shortness of breath, the doctor selected a combination of medications tailored to address these particular manifestations. The prescribed drugs included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or aspirin to alleviate his chest pain and reduce inflammation. If needed, the doctor would add a colchicine prescription as a second-line therapy to further decrease inflammation, especially if Paul's Pericarditis was recurrent or persistent in nature. Considering the possibility of a bacterial infection, the doctor also prescribed an antibiotic regimen that would target the specific strain causing Paul's Pericarditis. If further testing indicated a viral origin, the doctor might opt for antiviral medications instead. To ensure Paul's safety and well-being, the doctor remained cautious of potential interactions between the prescribed medications and drugs he was already taking for other health conditions. They also asked Paul about any known drug allergies or previous adverse reactions, since having a comprehensive view of his medication history was pivotal to prevent untoward side effects. The physician then went through possible side effects of the prescribed medications, preparing Paul for any alterations in his normal routine or symptoms to watch for. They explained the importance of adhering to the prescribed schedule to ensure maximum drug efficacy while minimizing unwanted reactions. Throughout the treatment process, the doctor scheduled regular check-ups so as to monitor Paul's progress, making any necessary adjustments to the dosage or combination of drugs to better cater to his specific needs. This dynamic approach ensured that Paul would receive personalized care, optimizing his chances of recovery from Pericarditis. In conclusion, the doctor prescribed drugs for the Pericarditis infection Paul was suffering from, but the therapeutic approach required an intricate understanding of Paul's medical history, potential drug interactions, and a tailored medication plan that addressed his symptoms while minimizing potential adverse reactions. By adopting such a conscientious approach, the doctor aimed to deliver the best possible care, ensuring Paul's swift and safe recovery from this challenging condition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to Romanian","completion":"Doamnă Președintă, doamnelor și domnilor, aș dori să confirm faptul că, în Italia, libertatea presei există și este mai puternică ca niciodată. Libertatea presei în Italia este garantată de articolul 21 din Constituția italiană, care stipulează că \\"oricare persoană are dreptul să exprime liber gânduri, idei și opoziții sub forma de publicații și publicitate\\". Această prevedere constituțională a fost respectată în întregime și elimină orice îndoială privind acceptarea acestei valori fundamentale în societatea italiană. Aceasta înseamnă că, din punct de vedere legal, mass-media italiană nu se confruntă cu restricții în reportarea și prezentarea știrilor, opiniilor sau oricăror alte forme de informare. Cu alte cuvinte, nu există cenzură oficială, iar competiția între diferitele publicații și instituții mass-media asigură un spectru larg de forme și teme pentru informare și expresie. Mai mult, Italia este membră activă a Uniunii Europene, și adoptă și respectă legislația și directivele europene privind libertatea presei și protejarea democrației. Acest fapt aliniază Italia cu principiile democratice și valorile europene, asigurând un cadru comun și cooperare cu celelalte state membre în vederea protejării acestui drept fundamental. Cu toate acestea, este important de menționat că există totuși unele probleme și provocări cu care se confruntă presa italiană. Aceasta poate include influența economică și politică asupra mass-media, concentrarea proprietății mass-media în mâinile a câtorva actori și violența împotriva jurnaliștilor. Cu toate acestea, organele guvernamentale și nonguvernamentale, precum și instituțiile europene, colaborează pentru a aborda și rezolva astfel de probleme, promovând astfel un jurnalism de calitate, independent și pluralist în Italia. În concluzie, pot să confirm că libertatea presei în Italia nu doar că există, dar și se află într-o stare de evoluție și consolidare continuă. Se fac eforturi constante pentru a îmbunătăți contextul în care jurnalismul își desfășoară activitatea și pentru a proteja interesele și drepturile jurnaliștilor, care sunt elemente esențiale pentru menținerea democrației și a unei societăți informate."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Jackson), a deeply religious farmer and former blues guitarist, and Rae Doole (Christina Ricci), a young sex addict. Lazarus' wife and his brother were having an affair, which has left him bitter and angry. Rae's boyfriend Ronnie Morgan (Justin Timberlake) leaves for deployment with the 196th Field Artillery Brigade, Tennessee National Guard, and in his absence, she indulges in bouts of promiscuity and drug use. During one of Rae's binges, Ronnie's friend Gill Morton (Michael Raymond-James) tries to take advantage of her. She laughs at his advances, comparing him unfavorably with another man, and he severely beats her. Believing she's dead, Gill dumps Rae and leaves her for dead in only a shirt and panties by the side of the road and drives away. Lazarus discovers Rae unconscious in the road the next morning and brings her home to nurse her back to health. Lazarus goes to see Tehronne (David Banner) - the man who Lazarus thought had beaten her - and learns of her promiscuity. Over the course of several days, Rae, delirious with fever, occasionally wakes up and tries to flee from Lazarus. He chains her to the radiator to keep her from running away. After Rae regains her wits, Lazarus announces that it is his spiritual duty to heal her of her sinful ways and refuses to release her until he does so. Rae makes several attempts to escape, and even briefly has sex with a teenage boy who helps out on Lazarus' farm. She eventually comes to tolerate her position. Lazarus buys her a conservative dress to wear, plays the guitar for her, and feeds her home-cooked meals. Lazarus' pastor and close friend, R.L.

LOUIS (KMOV.com) – A memorial was set up at the scene where a young boy was hit and killed by a driver on the evening of March 9 in East St. Louis. According to police, 11-year-old Maurice A. Richards laid in the street for several minutes as cars drove around him, not stopping to help. The unidentified vehicle struck Richards in the area of State Street and Post Place around 6:30 p.m., about a block away from the boy’s home. After striking the boy, the suspect’s vehicle left the scene and several cars drove around the child before someone finally stopped and called 911, authorities said. Detective Jason Hicks from the East St. Louis Police Department said, \\"Senseless act and well, as citizens of this city, we have to do better because no one will protect it like us. So if you were one of the ones that saw the young man lying in the street and went around him, you know it's not right.\\" First responders took the child to the hospital where he later died. Several people in the neighborhood are outraged that other drivers never stopped to help. An East St. Louis resident, Matthew Walker said, “They could have at least called 911 and helped.” A memorial began on March 10 at the corner of State Street and Post Place. Family members said Richards was remembered as a happy child who loved to play with his brother and sisters. Maurice Richards’ aunt, Sheena Richards said, “He loved to play, ride his bike; be with his family. He always had his little brother tagging along with him.” The family said Richards was a 4th grader at Gordon Bush Elementary. The District’s Crisis Management Team was brought in to deal with students. Kelli Hawkins, Director of Communications and Public Affairs for the East St. Louis School District 189 said, “Today at school students are really somber. They understand what’s happened to their classmates and they’re attempting to process everything that’s going on. It’s a lot for an elementary school to deal with.” The boy’s family is asking for the hit-and-run driver to turn himself in. “We going to always miss Maurice, but it someone could come forward that would help a little, just a little, but not going to bring him back,” said Sheena Richards.

LOUIS • An 11-year-old East St. Louis boy died Wednesday night after he was struck by a vehicle, and several other vehicles drove around him as he lay critically hurt in the street, police said. A family member identified the child as Maurice A. Richards. The incident happened about 6:30 p.m. A motorist who saw other cars drive around the boy in the 3700 block of State Street stopped to help, police Detective Jason Hicks said. The man blocked off the street and called 911. The driver who struck Maurice left the scene. “We have no vehicle description, no suspects as of right now,” Hicks said. The boy was taken to Cardinal Glennon Children’s Hospital in St. Louis, where he died about an hour later. He lived in the 500 block of North 37th Street, near where he was hit. Family members told police he was simply trying to cross the street, Hicks said. Maurice was a student at Gordon Bush Elementary School and liked to play with his four sisters and brother, said his grandmother, Gertrude Richards. “He was a happy kid. He loved to ride his bike,” a tearful Richards said late Wednesday. “He loved to eat. He was mostly a meat eater. He liked to eat like his daddy.” He was the son of Bobby Richards and Erica Steele. Gertrude Richards said Maurice’s relatives didn’t know how long the boy was in the street, and said that witnesses said his clothes were “drenched” from the rain. “They said one lady was praying over him, and she asked other people to join and they wouldn’t join,” she said. “I guess they just drove by. They had to stop another car from almost hitting him.” Hicks implored anyone with information to come forward. “The citizens need to come together and try to get who did this and get justice for that young man,” he said. He called out those who drove around the boy. “Just for the fact that they’re seeing someone lying in the street and didn’t render aid ... they need to be held accountable. We as citizens of East St. Louis need to start taking a more serious role in things that go on.” Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call East St. Louis Police at 618-482-6600. ||||| EAST ST.

When you combine like this, you simply add their numbers. -15*t - 14*t = (-15 - 14) * t = -29*t Now our equation looks like this: -29*t - 29 = 0 Next, we're going to try to get \\"t\\" all alone. We're going to get rid of that -29 next to it. To do that, we're going to add 29 to both sides of the equation. -29*t - 29 + 29 = 0 + 29 That simplifies to: -29*t = 29 Now, we need to get rid of that -29 that's being multiplied by \\"t\\". To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -29. (-29*t) / (-29) = 29 / (-29) When we do that, we get: t = -1 So, the value of \\"t\\" that makes this equation true is -1.

The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument. The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce). Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building. The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War. Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings. St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871. The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road.

After back-to-back sub-par performances by the Patriots offense, they faced Derek Carr and the lowly Raiders in their 2014 home opener looking to have their first breakout performance of the season. After both teams punted on their opening drive, the Raiders reached the Patriots 31 and struck first blood on a 49-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. After both teams punted again, the Patriots embarked on a 15 play, 84-yard drive, converting four third-downs, and scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski midway through the second quarter to take a 7-3 lead. The Raiders punted on their next drive, and Marquette King punted only 22 yards to midfield. With the great field position, the Patriots drove all the way to the Raiders 2, but their red zone struggles continued, and they settled for a 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski, giving them a 10-3 lead at halftime. Strong defense continued in the second half. The Raiders drove deep into Patriots territory early in the second quarter, but could only score on a 37-yard field goal by Janikowski. Following a Patriots punt, the Raiders drove from their own 14, to the Patriots 37, but a false start penalty on guard Donald Penn made it 3rd-and-15, and then Carr completed a 13-yard pass to James Jones to the Patriots 29, bringing up a 4th-and-2. The Raiders decided to settle with Janikowski's 47 yard field goal, making the score 10-9. Matthew Slater returned the ensuing kickoff 26 yards to the Patriots 41. With the good field position, the Patriots drove to the Raiders 2 again, but were once again held out of the end zone, and increased their lead to 13-9 on another 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After the Raiders went three-and-out, the Patriots marched 63 yards culminating with Gostkowski's 36-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 16-9 midway through the fourth quarter. The Raiders, though, couldn't muster up any offense against the Patriots and they went three-and-out again, but the Patriots failed to put the game away and punted. In just three plays the Raiders reached Patriots territory, but two plays later, on 3rd-and-7 at the Patriots 30-yard line, Carr threw an incomplete pass seemingly bringing up a do-or-die 4th down, but Ryan was called for pass interference moving the ball to the Patriots 6-yard line. On the very next play, Darren McFadden scored on a 6-yard touchdown run, but the score was nullified by a holding penalty on Raiders left guard Gabe Jackson. On the next play, Carr's pass attempt was tipped and intercepted by Vince Wilfork with 0:51 seconds left, which sealed the win for the Patriots. Tom Brady had his best game to date, despite being pressured relentlessly by the Oakland defensive line, including being sacked twice, completing 24 of 37 passes for 234 yards, with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. The running game struggled, with Ridley leading the team with only 54 yards on 19 carries. Julian Edelman was the leading receiver for either team, with 10 catches for 84 yards. Rob Gronkowski continued to slowly work himself into the offense catching only 3 passes for 44 yards, but also caught the only touchdown. Derek Carr had a sub-par day, going 21 of 34 for only 174 yards, with no touchdowns and an interception. Both defenses were spectacular holding the opposing offense to under 300 yards of offense (241 for the Raiders, 297 for the Patriots).

Inside the prison, several gang members, Charles Makley (Christian Stolte), Harry Pierpont (David Wenham), Ed Shouse (Michael Vieau), Homer Van Meter (Stephen Dorff), and Walter Dietrich (James Russo) acquire guns smuggled into the prison inside boxes of thread sent to the prison's shirt factory, with which they take a few guards hostage and march them to the changing rooms. At the same time, the warden that meets Dillinger and Hamilton suddenly recognizes Dillinger. Dillinger admits to his identity, and at this point, he suddenly springs his handcuffs off, and he and Hamilton conjure shotguns and force the warden to open the door to the break room at gunpoint, at the moment that the other inmates come in. They force the guards to take off their uniforms at gunpoint. Everything goes as planned until Shouse suddenly beats a guard to death in a fit of rage and another guard gets shot. A running shootout ensues as the men run towards the waiting car. Unfortunately, a sniper on the wall shoots Dietrich in the back just as he is about to get into the car, mortally wounding him, and a furious Dillinger kicks Shouse out of the car.In East Liverpool, Ohio, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) and several other FBI agents are running down Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum). As Floyd sprints through an apple orchard, Purvis aims a rifle at him, fires one round, and misses, as Floyd fires back a burst from his Thompson submachine gun. Purvis sets his sights, aims, and fires again. The bullet goes straight through Floyd's chest and mortally wounds him.Meanwhile, Dillinger's gang reaches a hideout, where crooked Chicago cop Martin Zarkovich (John Michael Bolger) convinces them to hide out in Chicago, where they can be sheltered by the Mafia. Dillinger exchanges brief words with a Mafia car dealer and close... My question: What happens to Frechette during interrogation?

Unaware of the mishap, I casually strolled back into the living room to continue watching my favorite show with my best friend, Alex. Step 1: Establish the problem in the story – the malfunctioning timer. About 45 minutes passed when Alex glanced towards the kitchen and noticed a faint smell of something burning. He turned to me and asked, \\"Hey, did you forget about the food in the oven?\\" Step 2: Develop a sense of urgency – Alex notices the smell, implying that the food might be overcooked or burnt. Immediately, my heart started racing, and I jumped off the couch, dashing towards the kitchen as quickly as I could. As I entered the kitchen, the smell of burnt food overwhelmed me, and I could see smoke coming from the oven. Step 3: Show the protagonist's reaction – the character panics and rushes to the kitchen. Using a thick oven mitt, I opened the oven door to a burst of thick smoke pouring out. I could hardly see through the smoke as I reached in and carefully, yet quickly, removed the burnt dish.

Here is a news article: This crawl of online resources of the 115th US Congress was performed on behalf of The United States National Archives & Records ||||| Clark bill aims to combat dangerous ‘swatting’ hoaxes Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Katherine Clark (D-MA) and Congressman Patrick Meehan (R-PA) introduced the Interstate Swatting Hoax Act of 2015, legislation to combat attacks known as swatting. Swatting is defined as the intentional misleading of emergency responders in order to provoke a S.W.A.T. team response. In recent years, swatting has become a widely used tool for online harassers to attack journalists, academics, domestic violence survivors, and celebrities. Perpetrators locate victims’ private information online and use technology to conceal their identity as they contact emergency responders. In one recent swatting attack, a 10 year old became the unintended victim of swatting when an armed S.W.A.T. team raided his home after an anonymous call falsely reported there was a shooter inside. While federal law prohibits using the telecommunications system to falsely report a bomb threat hoax or a terrorist attack, falsely reporting other emergency situations is not currently prohibited. The Interstate Swatting Hoax Act would close this loophole by prohibiting the use of the interstate telecommunications system to knowingly transmit false information with the intent to cause an emergency law enforcement response. Recently reported cases included a string of swatting attacks in the MetroWest region of Massachusetts. Several cases of bogus calls to police departments in Framingham and Ashland were all reported within a six month period. Similar incidents have been reported in Delaware and Chester Counties in Pennsylvania. “Perpetrators of these hoaxes purposefully use our emergency responders to harm their victims,” said Clark. “These false reports are dangerous and costly, and have resulted in serious injury to victims and law enforcement. It is time to update our laws to appropriately address this crime.” “Our law enforcement personnel are already struggling to protect our communities with limited resources,” said Meehan. “The wave of ‘swatting’ incidents are costing our police departments time and tax dollars. ‘Swatting’ cases divert attention from serious situations that require the attention of highly trained personnel and puts innocent civilians at risk. This legislation updates federal statute and makes it clear that ‘swatting’ is no joke.” The FBI estimates 400 swatting attacks occur every year. Some attacks, however, have been reported to cost local law enforcement agencies as much as 100,000. The most serious cost of these attacks is the danger they pose to emergency responders, innocent victims, and their families. Swatting attacks have resulted in injury to law enforcement officers, heart attacks, and serious injury to victims. Clark has championed combatting severe online threats and abuse, which disproportionately affects women and girls. Clark successfully garnered the U.S. House’s backing to instruct the Department of Justice to investigate severe online threats, and to use existing laws to prosecute these crimes. Clark introduced the Prioritizing Online Threats Enforcement Act to ensure that federal law enforcement has the resources they need to enforce laws regarding the use of the internet to perpetuate severe threats. Meehan, a former U.S. Attorney and local prosecutor, has worked extensively on criminal justice issues during his tenure in Congress. Meehan chaired the Homeland Security Committee’s cybersecurity subcommittee in the 113th Congress and led the effort to enact the first significant cybersecurity legislation in a decade. He’s examined closely the use of communications networks to disrupt the operations of law enforcement and other first responders. The Interstate Swatting Hoax Act of 2015 has received the support of: the National District Attorneys Association, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, the Women’s Media Center, Hollaback!, the Black Women’s Health Imperative, the SPARK Movement, Women, Action & the Media, the WMC Speech Project, the National Center for Victims of Crime, the FBI Agents Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and the Major County Sheriffs’ Association.

The bill takes aim at a tactic known as \\"swatting\\" — where a prankster calls the police and alerts them to a bomb threat or other criminal activity going down at the target's house. Unable to tell the difference between a fake threat and a real one, the authorities send a SWAT team to storm the victim's abode, guns drawn. And the victim has no choice but to endure the abuse. It's a form of primarily Internet-driven trolling that's become all too common, lawmakers say. Look it up on YouTube and you'll get tens of thousands of results like this one. Video gamers are often the victims — and the perpetrators. Some players broadcast their hobby online, with cameras trained on their own faces. So when a particularly nasty gamer wants the instant, visual gratification of humiliating his or her in-game rival in real time, pop goes the call to 911. But gamers aren't the only people who've been subjected to this kind of harassment. Journalists, politicians and celebrities have all been targeted. The bill that just passed out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee would impose up to a 20-year prison sentence and heavy fines for pulling the stunt, defined in the text as \\"the transmission of misleading or inaccurate caller identification information with the intent to trigger a response by a law enforcement agency.\\" In part, the swatting trend underscores how easy it is, in the Internet age, for a harasser to dig up personal information belonging to their targets, such as their addresses. It also mirrors the growing militarization of police forces across the country, a trend that simply makes it easier for more police departments to meet situations with guns and tactical gear. And it highlights the blurring boundaries between online spaces and offline spaces — increasingly, the Internet is the same as real life. The bill's next hurdle will be a floor vote in the House. ||||| It was a Sunday night late in January, and Congresswoman Katherine Clark and her husband were winding down from a busy weekend, watching television at their home in Melrose, a city just outside of Boston, when they noticed all the police lights outside. Her children had gone to bed, so Clark assumed something must be going on at one of her neighbors' homes. She went outside to investigate and saw two cruisers cutting off the street, and a heavy police presence, some with long guns drawn, swarming over her lawn. A police officer approached and explained there had been a call saying there were multiple gun shot victims at her address, and an active shooter still in the house. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below If Clark hadn't already been invested in the problem of online abuse, this certainly would have been enough to push her over the edge. She believes she was a victim that night of what is known as \\"swatting,\\" a form of harassment in which hoax calls are made to police in order to trigger an emergency response to the home of an intended target. While the FBI doesn't keep statistics on the number of incidences of swatting, it seems to have become an increasingly common form of abuse in recent years, with numerous high profile cases, including the targeting of celebrities, and in particular, members of the online-gaming community. The reason Clark seems to have been singled out was precisely because she has been such a vocal opponent of such tactics. One of her initiatives, the Interstate Swatting Hoax Act of 2015, co-sponsored by Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania, aims to prohibit falsely reporting an emergency using telecommunications systems. She was lucky, Clark says, because she was familiar with the tactic, \\"but it was nonetheless a frightening experience in those first few minutes when I thought something had happened to our neighbors, or that somebody might be loose in our neighborhood. AP \\"Your mind races through lots of scenarios,\\" she continues. \\"I can only imagine if you were not familiar with swatting, and if the police hadn't known they were responding to my house. It certainly has given me a new perspective on just how serious and dangerous this is.\\" The issue of online abuse, especially against women, became a particular focus for Clark after one of her constituents, video-game developer Brianna Wu, found herself at the center of Gamergate in 2014 and was subjected to a torrent of threats and abuse. At the time, Wu was getting hundreds of death threats a day, she says. Clark's office called her and said Clark wanted to take point on helping out because law enforcement wasn't doing enough. \\"When all the death threats first started happening, in 2014, I had every single advantage a person can have—they made a Law & Order episode about my case, I've been written about in media all over the world—but it was very frustrating to me, talking to law enforcement, that nothing was happening,\\" Wu says. In early 2015, Clark met with the FBI, where she claims they told her handling these cases was not a priority. That May, she convinced the House of Representatives to support her petition instructing the Department of Justice to \\"intensify its efforts to combat this destructive abuse,\\" and to \\"increase investigations and prosecutions of these crimes.\\" The problem, say both Clark and Wu, isn't that local police aren't interested in protecting the citizens in their cities and towns. They just haven't been trained in how to deal with it. \\"Local beat cops are understandably concerned with enforcing local order, not enforcing telecommunication violations,\\" Wu says. \\"But at the FBI level, it's been extremely frustrating... the problem with the FBI as I understand it is they have, what, 15,000 agents, and there isn't a specific department that is tasked with putting these kinds of violations forward where you threaten to kill or rape a woman.\\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Two other bills introduced by Clark aim to address this. The Prioritizing Online Threats Enforcement Act would provide additional resources and a mandate to the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate and enforce the existing federal laws regarding online threats. The Cybercrime Enforcement Training Assistance Act would allocate funds to local police departments around the country to better train their officers in dealing with online threats. While extreme cases like swatting affect a relatively small number of people, the problem of online abuse writ large has grown exponentially. Seventy-three percent of adult Internet users have seen someone be harassed online, while 40 percent have experienced it themselves, according to numbers from Pew Research. Eighteen percent have experienced \\"more severe\\" types of abuse, such as physical threats, sustained abuse, sexual harassment, or stalking. Young women, in particular, are subjected to these forms of abuse at higher rates. Esquire Michael Stillwell Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Advertisement - Continue Reading Below And it's a problem with a significant economic impact as well. \\"This is not a case of a woman being dramatic because someone said something to her online. This is an extremely serious economic issue that effects the entire technology work force,\\" Wu says. \\"People in tech routinely get these kinds of threats when we speak openly, and it is literally chasing people out of the field. Katherine Clark isn't just a fantastic advocate for women, she's an advocate for the technology industry.\\" Last month, the issue of abuse bubbled to the surface once again with the introduction of News Genius. The site and application allows users to comment, correct, and elaborate on articles published on the web through highlighted annotations. As it was rolled out, some pointed out its potential for abusing writers on their own websites, even those who didn't opt in and didn't ask for their work to be opened up to outside comments. The controversy prompted Clark to address a letter to Genius, saying that while it has potential positive benefits, the service could \\"also be used as a tool to harass, intimidate, and silence.\\" (Genius did not respond to requests to comment on this story.) Since then, Genius has added a \\"report abuse\\" button, which is a step in the right direction. We called Clark to ask what prompted her to jump into the Genius debate, and to elaborate on her thoughts about online abuse in general. ESQ: What brought Genius to your attention? Clark: We started seeing it online and had heard from some people about Genius and how its ability to annotate any website or blog post was already starting to be used in abusive ways. We were pleased that after our letter, they added a button to their app so you could report abuse, which they didn't have. My staff in D.C. actually met with them yesterday to continue the conversation. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below But it really goes to our broader point about how all these companies need to be looking at their applications from the perspective of how they can be used for severe online abuse, and what they are doing to prevent that. Whatever their applications' intent is, to make something that is helpful and promotes conversation and opinion sharing instead of shutting down voices. Were they receptive to your ideas? It's a work in progress, but I think they are receptive. What we're trying to push for is that everybody can have a voice online, and that it is a safe place for everyone to express opinions, especially feminist opinions, which tend to get a lot of abusive responses. I think at the same time, we're really trying to promote diversity in technology, whether that be women or people of color. We have found in high tech it tends to be a very white, male-dominated field. Without the perspective of women and people of color, sometimes you miss that the application you're designing is easily exploited and used for online abuse. What got the ball rolling for you working on this? Was it Brianna Wu's story? It was. We'd heard that Brianna Wu was a constituent and she had been a consistent target of Gamergate, so we reached out and asked if we could be helpful, which led to us getting very involved in this issue on more macro level. We met with the FBI, just to see how they handle these cases. They told us pretty clearly that these cases are not a priority. We led a House effort to petition the Department of Justice to pursue cases of extreme online threats using existing statutes and laws, and that was successful. Since then, we've come up with a swatting bill and a bill that would prioritize online threats and give the DOJ more resources to be able to investigate and prosecute those cases. And just recently, we filed a bill that would give local police the training they need to be able to respond to these cases.

Getty Images Joanne Rathe In reading women tell their stories about these things, and men as well, they say they call the police, and the police don't really know what to do with it. What are local police able to do about it? We've found, from constituents and victims that we've talked to across the country, that that is exactly what happens. Very often the police are well-intentioned. They want to be helpful and responsive, but this is just not something they understand or have a lot of experience with. We have constituents who have met with police who say, \\"What is Twitter?\\" and, \\"Why don't you just get offline?\\" or, \\"Why were you playing a video game?\\" I think it's hard for some of the local law enforcement where they may not have ever had training in this area—they're trained to respond to imminent threats where there's something physical that has happened or the person is nearby. It's very different to say, \\"These are threats that I'm receiving over the Internet, but they're terrifying, and they're causing me to lose money from my business and to feel very unsafe in my house, because my address has been released and these threats are very detailed.\\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below We're hoping with this bill that would give them training and the ability to understand that these threats can be as terrifying as being stalked by someone who is physically in your yard. And they can have the same economic effect on someone when they are giving up public appearances or no longer feel they can be in their role as a journalist or writing blog posts or whatever the profession they may be in. For most of us, our professions and careers have a large online presence now. And this is a real economic issue for women, especially women of color, who tend to have the highest rates of sever abuse online. Are you optimistic about any of these bills? Is there any meaningful movement at the moment? Any pushback? I think the one that we feel we may get action on the soonest is the swatting bill. Quite frequently the reactions from my colleagues is one of confusion—they don't know what swatting is. But usually we can find examples from their districts, and that puts it in a very different light for members of Congress, that this is something that's affecting their constituents. The others have considerable costs associated with them, so we know that's going to be a longer haul. With the police training, we're looking at 20 million a year, which will obviously be harder to sell to Congress. Is that on a federal or state level? That doesn't seem like all that much. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Twenty million of federal dollars to train in the states. I think it's just a start. But it's a high enough figure; in this particular Congress, any bill with money attached has a high barrier to get over. But we're going to keep pushing, have briefings for members of Congress and their staff. We just recently were at the SXSW Online Harassment summit. And we're trying to use my position in Congress to really publicize and educate members of Congress and our constituents on how serious this problem is, and how it needs a systemic response that is just not currently available to victims. That's the other thing: It's a big waste of money to send out the SWAT team, and it's taking them away from something serious. Right. In one of my communities, Framingham, Massachusetts, where they had a string of swatting incidents back in the summer, when the next call came in and it turned out it was actually an active shooter at the house, it wasn't that they didn't respond, but they were pretty convinced it was a hoax. And that's also a dangerous situation for police if they're not taking all the precautions they would because they've responded to so many hoaxes. Do you see the conversation on this shifting? I see women in media talking about this all the time, but there's still plenty of pushback from the \\"men's rights\\" types. I think we have a long way to go. But I am committed to using my seat in Congress, and whatever bully pulpit that gives me, to be able to talk about this, and to let people know: These are not comments where people are disagreeing or have a different point of view and are being passionate about it. This is really very dangerous, very threatening, persistent behavior that is already criminal. We are not looking for major changes to the law; we are looking to enforce it, and to be able to educate local police and law enforcement about what the dangers are and how they can be helpful when they have someone who is presented with these online threats.

Solve this instance: Article: I can remember the day my father came home from the war. As he walked up the front path of our home, he saw Mum and me and he dropped the suitcase. I was only five years old so Dad made a fuss of me, then began making an even bigger fuss of my mother. This left me free to examine all the stuff lying around the broken suitcase, and I was quick to notice a newspaper advertisement displaying a new piano. When Dad saw me holding up the newspaper cutting, he smiled. \\"Yes, that's right,\\" he said. \\"I bought your mum a piano for ten pounds down and two pounds a week.\\" A few moments later, a horse pulled a cart with a piano on top. Soon we all stared at it in our small lounger room. Mum had never been close to a piano before, except at the kindergarten I attended, and she used to say how wonderful it would be if the teachers could teach her to play. After tea that night, Mum began to teach herself to play. She plinked the keys for about two hours and drove everybody in the street mad, until Dad gently said, \\"Enough is enough.\\" From that day on, she would plink between doing the cooking and housework. Three months went by and Mum was now a skilled pianist, holding parties with all the neighbors gathering around to sing. Although we were poor, Mum felt like a princess and was delighted at all the attention she was receiving. At the height of Mum's happiness, I began to notice that Dad was looking increasingly worried. It turned out that since returning from the war, he'd been unable to find a job. Then, a few weeks later, I observed two men taking Mum's piano away. Mum sobbed in the kitchen. Suddenly, it all became clear to me: no job, no money, no piano. Dad finally got a job. Mum was happy again as if he'd just win the lottery . Dad had to study to qualify as an account. Every night after dinner he'd place a stack of books on the kitchen table and study late into the night. Mum didn't say much but I could tell she was proud of Dad. Two years later, Dad bought Mum another piano. This time he paid cash for it. Question: How did the author's Dad buy the piano for his mum? Options: (A) He paid part of the bill regularly. (B) He earned it by winning a bet. (C) He paid cash for it. (D) He bought it as a big bargain. Student:","completion":"A"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which entity is this text about? Carl Gustav Jung (; German: [karl jUNG]; 26 July 1875 - 6 June 1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology. His work has been influential not only in psychiatry but also in anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and religious studies. As a notable research scientist based at the famous Burgholzli hospital, under Eugen Bleuler, he came to the attention of the Viennese founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. Carl Gustav Jung was born in Kesswil, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau, on 26 July 1875 as the second and first surviving son of Paul Achilles Jung (1842-1896) and Emilie Preiswerk (1848-1923). Their first child, born in 1873, was a boy named Paul who survived only a few days. Being the youngest son of a noted Basel physician of German descent, also called Karl Gustav Jung (1794-1864), whose hopes of achieving a fortune never materialised, Paul Jung did not progress beyond the status of an impoverished rural pastor in the Swiss Reformed Church; his wife had also grown up in a large family, whose Swiss roots went back five centuries. Emilie was the youngest child of a distinguished Basel churchman and academic, Samuel Preiswerk (1799-1871), and his second wife. Preiswerk was antistes, the title given to the head of the Reformed clergy in the city, as well as a Hebraist, author and editor, who taught Paul Jung as his professor of Hebrew at Basel University. When Jung was six months old, his father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in Laufen, but the tension between his parents was growing. Emilie Jung was an eccentric and depressed woman; she spent considerable time in her bedroom where she said that spirits visited her at night. Although she was normal during the day, Jung recalled that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. He reported that one night he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure coming from her room with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body. Jung had a better relationship with his father. Jung's mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near Basel for an unknown physical ailment. His father took the boy to be cared for by Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel, but he was later brought back to his father's residence. Emilie Jung's continuing bouts of absence and often depressed mood influenced her son's attitude towards women--one of \\"innate unreliability\\". This was a view that he later called the \\"handicap I started off with\\". He believed it contributed to his sometimes patriarchal views of women, but these were common in the society of his time. After three years of living in Laufen, Paul Jung requested a transfer; he was called to Kleinhuningen, next to Basel in 1879. The relocation brought Emilie Jung closer into contact with her family and lifted her melancholy. When he was nine years old, Jung's sister Johanna Gertrud (1884-1935) was born. Known in the family as \\"Trudi\\", she later became a secretary to her brother.","completion":"This text is about Carl Gustav Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology.

Question: Q: Shivering and adipose tissue called brown fat are used by mammals in particular to produce what? Choices: - energy - blood - nutrition - heat A: Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is - heat. Mammals, especially humans, convert energy stored in brown adipose tissue (BAT), also known as brown fat, into heat. This process is known as thermogenesis, which serves to maintain body temperature in colder conditions. The heat-production mechanism helps mammals, including humans, to survive in cold environments without freezing. BAT is packed with mitochondria, which are cell organelles popularly referred to as the \\"powerhouses\\" of the cell because they are primarily responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). These mitochondria have a protein called UCP1 (Uncoupling Protein 1) or thermogenin that helps generate heat instead of ATP when the mitochondria metabolize fatty acids. The thermogenic activity of the BAT is activated by the sympathetic nervous system in response to cold exposure. Shivering is another way the body produces heat in response to cold. When our body experiences cold temperatures, our muscles quickly contract and relax, a process that we recognize as shivering. While it may be uncomfortable, shivering is an essential defense mechanism against the cold. This quick back-and-forth movement of our muscles generates heat to warm our bodies, an energy-consuming process that raises our metabolic rate and thereby helps maintain a suitable body temperature. Therefore, both shivering and brown fat are part of the body's built-in heating system designed to keep us warm in cold environments. While they represent different physiological responses, both serve the essential function of generating heat to maintain our body's core temperature. This ability to regulate body temperature is one reason mammals can adapt to a wide range of environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What might a bird who is preening might be involuntarily communicating? Context: Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.

Briefly summarize this sentence: four right-wing members of israel 's parliament came out in favor tuesday of returning the golan heights to syria in exchange for a peace accord .","completion":"On Tuesday, four members of Israel's parliament, who are known for their right-wing political leanings, publicly expressed their support for an initiative to return the Golan Heights region back to Syria. This potential territorial concession is viewed as a means to broker peace with Syria. The Golan Heights, a region of strategic importance and a point of contention, was captured by Israel from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967. Despite its significance to Israel in terms of military security and water resources, these parliamentarians believe achieving a durable peace is more valuable. This development signifies a potential shift in Israel's political stance towards the long-standing territorial dispute, given that right-wing groups have normally advocated for the retention of such territories for security and religious reasons. Therefore, their support for this action shows their willingness to make significant concessions for a more peaceful relationship with Syria. The return of the Golan Heights to Syria, however, hinges on the signing and successful implementation of a peace accord which, although has the potential to resolve ongoing tensions, can entail a complex and sensitive negotiation process involving various stakeholders both internally and internationally. These four parliamentarians' stance should, thus, be considered in the broader context of regional political dynamics and prevailing sentiments within the Israeli society towards such territorial concessions. Moreover, while this proposal provides a potential solution to the Golan Heights dispute, it also opens up discussions about the future of other disputed territories and the wider Israel-Arab conflict. It remains uncertain how this stance will affect the overall political climate in the Middle East and how other political factions within Israel, as well as international actors, will respond to it. In summary, while the unexpected support from these four right-wing parliamentarians for the return of the Golan Heights may represent a significant shift in some Israeli political circles, the feasibility and practicality of their proposal would require further scrutiny and agreements both domestically and internationally."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Luxor (Egypt) (AFP) - Scans of King Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings point to a secret chamber, archaeologists said Saturday, possibly heralding the discovery of Queen Nefertiti's long-sought mummy. Using hi-tech infrared and radar technology, researchers are trying to unravel the mystery over the legendary monarch's resting place. A wife of Tutankhamun's father Akhenaten, Nefertiti played a major political and religious role in the 14th century BC, and the discovery of her tomb would be a major prize for Egyptologists. Experts are now \\"approximately 90 percent\\" sure there is a hidden chamber in Tutankhamun's tomb, Antiquities Minister Mamduh al-Damati told a news conference. The scans were spurred by a study by renowned British archaeologist Nicholas Reeves that said Nefertiti's lost tomb may be hidden in an adjoining chamber. Speaking at the same press conference, Reeves said the initial results could bear out his theory. View gallery Johanna Gassmann paints a replica of the bust of Nefertiti in Berlin on October 2, 2015 (AFP Photo/J … \\"Clearly it does look from the radar evidence as if the tomb continues, as I have predicted,\\" he said. \\"The radar, behind the north wall (of Tutankhamun's burial chamber) seems pretty clear.

Experts carried out a preliminary scan of the tomb earlier this month using infra-red thermography to map out the temperature of its walls. Damati said at that time that the analysis showed \\"differences in the temperatures registered on different parts of the northern wall\\" of the tomb. But the minister and Reeves had differed on whose mummy they expected to find. According to Reeves, professor of archaeology at the University of Arizona, Tutankhamun, who died unexpectedly, was buried hurriedly in an underground chamber probably not intended for him. View gallery The golden sarcophagus of King Tutankhamun in his burial chamber at the Valley of the Kings (AFP Pho … The boy king died aged 19 in 1324 BC after just nine years on the throne. His final resting place was discovered by another British Egyptologist, Howard Carter, in 1922. Reeves's theory is that priests would have been forced to reopen Nefertiti's tomb 10 years after her death because the young pharaoh's own mausoleum had not yet been built. But Damati believes that such a chamber, if found adjoining Tutankhamun's tomb, may contain Kiya, another of Akhenaten's wives. Akhenaten is known for having temporarily converted ancient Egypt to monotheism by imposing the cult of sun god Aton. Nefertiti's role in the cult would have ruled out her burial in the Valley of the Kings according to Zahi Hawass, the country's former antiquities minister and expert on ancient Egypt. \\"Nefertiti will never be buried in the Valley of the Kings,\\" he told AFP. \\"The lady was worshipping Aton with Akhenaten for years. The priests would never allow her to be buried in the Valley of the Kings,\\" he said. Hawass also questioned how archaeologists would enter the hidden part of the tomb without causing damage. Damati said that after the analysis, that would be the next challenge. \\"The data is being analysed to get a clear picture of what's behind the wall,\\" he said. \\"The next step, which we will announce once we agree on it, will be accessing what's behind the wall without damaging the tomb,\\" he said. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Tutankhamun may have been Nefertiti's son Egyptian officials now say they are \\"90% sure\\" that there is a hidden chamber in King Tutankhamun's tomb. The Antiquities Ministry said it had carried out scans to gather more information about the theory. Archaeologist Nicholas Reeves believes Tutankhamun's remains may have been rushed into an outer chamber of what was originally Queen Nefertiti's tomb. The remains of Tutankhamun, who may have been her son, were found in 1922. He died 3,000 years ago aged 19.

If I am right it is a continuation - corridor continuation - of the tomb, which will end in another burial chamber,\\" he said. Mr Damati said the scans would now be sent to Japan for further analysis. Dr Reeves developed his theory after the Spanish artistic and preservation specialists, Factum Arte, were commissioned to produce detailed scans of Tutankhamun's tomb. The scans were then used to produce a facsimile of the 3,300-year-old tomb near the site of the original Valley of the Kings in Luxor. While assessing the scans last February, Dr Reeves spotted what he believed were marks indicating where two doorways used to be. The archaeologist from the University of Arizona says he believes Nefertiti may lie inside. Tutankhamun's tomb was the most intact ever discovered in Egypt. Close to 2,000 objects were found inside. But its layout has been a puzzle for some time - in particular, why it was smaller than those of other kings' tombs. Dr Reeves believes there are clues in the design of the tomb that indicate it was designed to store the remains of a queen, not a king. His theory has yet to be peer-reviewed and leading Egyptologists have urged caution over the conclusion.

The trio had accidentally joined the French Foreign Legion after mistaking it for the American Legion while trying to evade their landlord in Paris. As part of their assignment within the legion, they were tasked with protecting Captain Gorgonzola from potential threats posed by the native population in the desert. When Captain Gorgonzola was kidnapped, the stooges were given the responsibility of rescuing him and bringing him back alive. Disguising themselves as Santa Claus and utilizing a sleigh and a reindeer, they managed to infiltrate the town where the captain had been taken. Despite their disguises not being effective, they successfully overpowered a guard and proceeded further into the town in search of Captain Gorgonzola. Eventually, they discovered that the captain was held captive by a sheik who was attempting to coerce him into exchanging the French Foreign Legion's ammunition for valuable jewelry and a harem of beautiful women. Determined to rescue Captain Gorgonzola, the stooges disguised themselves once more, this time as members of the sheik's harem. They exploited a distraction during a dance to incapacitate the sheik and his chief bodyguard, thus enabling them to escape along with the captain. The group then accidentally stumbled upon a lion's den, but Curly managed to tame the lion, convincing it to help them return to their camp by pulling a wagon. In summary, the stooges were guarding Captain Gorgonzola for the French Foreign Legion, which they had unwittingly joined as a result of their misadventures in Paris. Their mission was to ensure the captain's safety from the native population and other potential adversaries in the desert."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Question: Where is one likely to find an old newspaper? Choices: - library - lawn - front door - jail - subway The rationale to choose \\"library\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is \\"library.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"library\\" as the answer is that libraries typically have archives and large collections of newspapers, including old editions. This is because libraries serve as repositories for all kinds of information resources, including both current and historical newspapers. In many cases, libraries maintain bound volumes, microforms, or digital copies of newspapers, allowing patrons to access and research older issues. Now let's examine why the other options are less likely or incorrect: - Lawn: While it is possible to find a discarded newspaper on someone's lawn, it would likely be a recent edition and not an older one, and it's not a reliable or consistent source for finding old newspapers. - Front door: Similar to the \\"lawn\\" scenario, a newspaper found at someone's front door would likely be a current edition, as newspapers are typically delivered to residences daily or weekly. This would not be a reliable location to find an old newspaper. - Jail: Jails or prisons do not typically maintain a collection of old newspapers. They might have current newspapers for inmates to read, but these facilities are not designed for research or accessing archived materials. - Subway: While one might occasionally spot a newspaper left behind on a subway train or platform, it would most likely be a recent edition. Subway stations and trains are not suitable places for storing or researching old newspapers. Therefore, the most reliable and likely location to find an old newspaper is a library, due to their extensive collections and archival efforts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There was a huge corporation in which I had a contract with. I was called in, to help them uncover what they considered “a very serious series of incidents”. Their own “in house” attempts were fruitless. It turned out, they had an over-sized engineering department, and that it had been announced that this would be scaled back due to completion of contracts. Someone though, within the engineering department, was sabotaging the continued work, slowing the completion. I was to go undercover, posing as a visiting engineer from a distant plant, and find out who the perpetrator/s were, as they wished to file legal action. So, this is at the corporate headquarters, in the late 1980’s. These people were making 6 figure incomes easily. That being said, you kind of expect a bit more of a dignified behavior here than you would with a construction laborer or dishwasher. I completed my job in four days, giving them the evidence and name of the lone individual respsonsible for the sabotage. What exactly was he doing? He carried rubber gloves in his back pocket, and he would periodically use the restroom, and remove his feces from the toilet and smear it all over the walls, covering as much surface as he could. He would also visit restrooms in different departments and do the same. This would cause the unionized individuals, who only had that restroom to use in their area, to walk off their work stations. Seriously, a butt-hurt guy fearing a layoff, so he decided to smear his shit all over the place before it even happened.

Question 2: Can nanotechnology create you an infinite amount of wealth by gold, diamonds, gems, oil, etc.? Options: - no - yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answer to Question 1: In theory, nanotechnology has the potential to create an unlimited number of gold, gems, oil, diamonds, and other valuable materials through manipulation at the molecular level. However, the idea that this could lead to infinite wealth is a bit more complex and unlikely. Here are a few reasons why: 1. Resource Scarcity: Even with nanotechnology, the raw materials needed to create these valuable materials are still finite. Natural resources are limited, and any manufacturing process that involves converting elements to the desired material will still be dependent on the availability of the required resources. 2. Energy Requirements: The processes involved in nanotechnology, such as atomic manipulation, would require a significant amount of energy. As energy production is currently limited by both resources and technology, it would be difficult to achieve a level of production that could support the creation of infinite wealth through nanotechnology. 3. Economic Impact: If the production of gold, gems, oil, diamonds, and other valuable materials were to become nearly limitless, their value could depreciate due to oversupply. In other words, the more of a resource that is available, the less valuable it becomes. This is known as the law of supply and demand in economics. 4. Technological Limitations: While nanotechnology has made significant advancements, we are still a long way from realizing its full potential. Currently, there is no known method for creating valuable materials such as gold and diamonds on a large scale, let alone in an unlimited capacity. Therefore, the idea of achieving infinite wealth through nanotechnology remains purely theoretical at this point. Answer to Question 2: The answer to this question is similar to the answer to Question 1. Nanotechnology has the potential to create wealth through the creation of gold, diamonds, gems, oil, and other valuable materials, but it is highly unlikely that it can create an infinite amount of wealth for the same reasons mentioned. To summarize, while nanotechnology may hold the potential to create a significant amount of wealth by producing valuable materials such as gold, diamonds, gems, and oil, it is unlikely to create infinite wealth due to resource scarcity, energy requirements, economic impact, and current technological limitations. Given the similarities between the two questions and the factors discussed, the answer to both questions would be \\"no.\\" While nanotechnology could lead to increased wealth production, it is unlikely to create infinite wealth through the creation of an unlimited number of gold, gems, oil, diamonds, and other valuable materials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa. He became one of the founders of the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU; at the opening ceremonies, he proclaimed that African states should reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President Thabo Mbeki. At the third AU summit, held in Libya in July 2005, he called for a greater level of integration, advocating a single AU passport, a common defence system and a single currency, utilising the slogan: \\"The United States of Africa is the hope.\\" In June 2005, Libya joined the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and in August 2008 Gaddafi was proclaimed \\"King of Kings\\" by an assembled committee of traditional African leaders.

Summarize this article: In the U.S., it is generally legal to use a hidden camera to record footage without a person's consent--provided that you are filming in public or within your own home. Many states have passed laws against filming people in spaces where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as bathrooms or personal bedrooms. It is generally legal to use a hidden camera in the workplace, as long your filming pertains to a business concern. Don't film someone at work without their consent in order to settle a personal dispute--unless you're ready to risk legal consequences. Laws vary between states and countries. Research the laws for your area before you record audio or video of anyone without their express consent. If you are planning to distribute the footage, sell the footage, or use it in court, then it is extremely important that you follow the law. If you are only planning to use the footage for personal entertainment purposes, you may not need to worry so much. Run a web search for \\"free webcam recording program\\" and install the software onto your computer. You may be able to use Windows Movie Maker or iVideo, if these are already installed on your computer. Search the Start menu (bottom left-hand corner of the Windows desktop) to figure out whether you have a program installed. When you leave the room, or when you are ready to start recording, boot up the recording software and click \\"Record\\". Cover up the USB cord with something so that it isn't obviously running to the hidden camera. Books, papers, or a jacket will do--anything that looks natural. Be subtle; only do this if you typically keep a webcam next to your computer. Keep in mind that while this may be a more straightforward approach, the snooper may be more suspicious if they notice a camera point at them--even if they don't think that it's turned on. Be sure to turn off, cover, or disable the LED light that shows that your webcam is running. The \\"recording\\" light may tip off a snooper that they are being filmed. If the screen is open and the snooper can see the webcam feed, they will know that they are being recorded. You have to be sneaky to catch a sneak. If you own a desktop computer, you should be able to turn off the monitor and leave the computer tower running. If you own a laptop, you may be able to put the screen to sleep while the recording program runs. You may also consider folding the screen down until the laptop is almost--but not quite--closed. The computer will look like it's off, but it will still be running. Leave the camera running when you think that it will capture what it needs to capture. If you're not sure, leave it on as often as possible. If time goes on and you don't capture anything incriminating, reconsider the situation. Was the snooping a one-time thing? Has the snooper found a way to sneak around your camera? Summary:","completion":"In the U.S., using hidden cameras to record footage without consent is generally legal in public spaces and within your own home, but not in private areas where individuals expect privacy. Workplace filming is allowed if it pertains to a business concern.

For the fourth straight home game the Patriots played the Jets in a contest where the final margin of victory was less than ten points, and third straight where the margin didn't exceed three points. Tom Brady made his 200th career regular season start. On the fourth play of the game, Shane Vereen went completely unnoticed by the Jets' secondary, on a wheel route, and Brady hit him for a 49-yard touchdown, just 1:29 into the game. Following this, the Jets drove all the ways to the Patriots 9. On 1st-and-goal, Geno Smith hit Jeremy Kerley for a touchdown, but the play was nullified when offensive guard Oday Aboushi was flagged for holding. The Patriots defense kept them out of the end zone over the next three plays and the Jets settled for a 22-yard field goal from Nick Folk. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets seemed primed for a touchdown, but another critical holding call moved the Jets out of the red zone, and Folk kicked a 47-yard field goal, making the score 7-6. The Patriots went three-and-out yet again, but once more the Jets could only get a Folk field goal, this one from 46 yards, but the Jets took their first lead, 9-7. This time the Patriots responded this time, racing 80 yards in 10 plays to take the lead on Brady's 3-yard touchdown pass to Vereen, this one for 3 yards, to take the lead. The Jets reached the Patriots 9 for the second time, but the Patriots defense once again turned into a brick wall in the red zone, and Folk had to kick his fourth field goal of the half to bring the score to 14-12. A crucial pass-interference penalty on Asher Allen on the Patriots' next drive, helped them reach Jets' territory and Gostkowski kicked a 39-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 17-12 lead at halftime. On the Jets first drive of the third quarter they continued their clock-draining strategy with an 11-play, 6:02 drive, this time reaching the end zone again with Chris Ivory scoring on a 1-yard touchdown plunge, giving the Jets their second lead of the game, 19-17. Once again though, the Patriots countered, moving 53 yards to the Jets 18, and Gostkowski banged in a 36-yard field goal, taking a 20-19 lead. The next five combined possessions ended in punts. With 10:51 remaining in the game, Tom Brady engineered a Brady-esque drive reaching the Jets 4. A 6-yard false start penalty on Wright and a 10-yard offensive pass interference penalty on LaFell sent them back to the Jets 19. Following an in-completion to Vereen, on 3rd-and-Goal, Brady rolled out to the left and found Danny Amendola for the touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 27-19. This was Amendola's only catch of the game. The Jets didn't give up though. Geno Smith engineered a 12-play, 86-yard drive, finding tight end Jeff Cumberland for a 10-yard TD pass to cut the Patriots' lead to two points with 2:31 remaining. However, the 2-point conversion failed and the Jets still trailed, 27-25.

Though not spectacular, Brady was efficient, completing 20 of 37 passes for 261 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. Geno Smith completed 20 of 34 passes for 226 yards, a touchdown, and no interceptions. Vereen was the top rusher & receiver for the Patriots with 43 yards rushing and 71 receiving. It was learned shortly after the game that stalwart defensive end Chandler Jones injured his hip and would miss seven games. The Jets ran for 218 yards on the night, led by Chris Ivory, who continued to be a pest to the Patriots, gaining 107 yards on 21 carries. Chris Johnson added 61 yards on 13 carries.The Jets out-gained the Patriots 423-323 and absolutely controlled the clock winning T.O.P. 40:54-19:06, but the Patriots defense tightened down when it mattered.

OPT: (a). World (b). Sports (c). Business (d). Science/Tech","completion":"This information is primarily related to Option (c). Business. While at first glance it could seem political due to the involvement of Treasurer Peter Costello and the mention of both houses of Parliament, the main discussion here is about economic events such as fiscal policies, promises related to economic growth and how these could influence the economy. The news article amongst other things is discussing official predictions of economic growth and government spending - topics which fall squarely within the realm of business and economy. Economy and business are intertwined as economic policies, growth indicators and governmental fiscal actions all directly impact the business environment of a country. Economic policies and spending determine the thrust areas of an economy and can significantly impact both the macro and micro business environments. Peter Costello, as Treasurer, would be largely responsible for managing the government's budget, economic policies and financial legislation, all of which directly influence business strategies and operations, hence, it's crucial to keep track of such events. Additionally, the events described could potentially impact factors such as taxes, legislation, and economic stability that directly shape the business environment, affecting both the investment and operational decisions of companies. Economic growth is a strong indicator of the overall health of an economy which will, in turn, affect businesses growth prospects. In conclusion, while there are elements of politics involved, the core theme of the article relates heavily to the field of business and economic conditions of a state.

Are they crazy about Britney Spears? Do they love the Backstreet Boys? Or do they dance to Eminem? Well, nearly 6,000 teens have taken part in a Teens & Music study, conducted by USA Weekend Magazine last autumn. And the results show what type of music is hot and what is not. It comes as no surprise that hip-hop and rap are the most popular types of music among American teenagers. They began in the mid-1970s, with young black kids in New York, taking music onto the streets. Hip-hop and rap are well-known for the breakdancing that goes with them. The word \\"rap\\" comes from a 1960s slang word for conversation. It is a rapid, slangy rhyme that is spoken rather than sung. Eminem is among the most popular rappers ever to hit the US. His first album \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" topped the American music chart in May 2000. Although about a third of teens in the US showed their support for him, almost as many said that his music was so offensive that they couldn't listen to it. Compared with Eminem, actor-rapper Will Smith is more of a star for the kids. He was awarded the Wannabe Award, on April 12 at Nickelodeon's 16th Annual Kids' Choice Awards. It is an award given to a celebrity whom kids most want to be. Pop music, such as Brittney Spears and the Backstreet Boys has always suited the tastes of the general public. It continues to enjoy support among teens and is second most popular after rap. Third is rock -- music with exciting dance beats and simple lyrics that speak loudly of social problems. The melodies are led by electric guitars. Rock became popular in the US in the early 1950s. American singer Elvis Presley and British group the Beatles became world-famous rock artists. The study also showed that jazz is least loved by American teens. It developed in the latter part of the 19th century from a mixture of African work songs and hymns .

As with zoneinfo, a user of Microsoft Windows configures DST by specifying the name of a location, and the operating system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows.

In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps.

Q:Given the following context: Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, and as part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What does the man who tends the hunting lodge threaten to tell the Chicago businessman about? from the following article ? Rosa Moline is the dissatisfied, restless wife of Lewis, a small-town Wisconsin doctor. She is easily bored, uninterested in her husband's career or in anything to do with her current circumstances. She has long desired a glamorous life, in a world where she can have expensive things and meet truly interesting people. For over a year, she has been having an affair with Neil Latimer, a Chicago businessman who owns the local hunting lodge. Tired of waiting for him to ask her to marry and move to Chicago, Rosa extorts money from Lewis' patients - who often do not have cash but pay him in produce or in other non-financial ways - to finance her trip to the city. Lewis does not yet know about the affair, but he is used to his wife's unease with her life; he discovers the extortion and throws the cash at her, telling her that if she goes to Chicago, she need not come back. Rosa immediately leaves and fully expects Latimer to welcome her. However, he avoids her at first, then when he does meet her, he tells her he is love with another woman and intends to marry. Devastated, Rosa returns to Wisconsin, where Lewis forgives her. She soon becomes pregnant and, briefly, seems to be trying to settle down. During a party for Moose, the man who tends to the hunting lodge, Latimer shows up. He lets Rosa know that he has changed his mind and wants to marry her. Moose overhears the couple planning for her divorce and their marriage; the next day, as everyone is heading out on a hunting trip, Moose bets that her lover will not want the baby and advises Rosa that she had better tell Latimer about it, or he will.

He sends Gibson videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him. Dagen awakens in a cage in an asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist; Suzanne, his lawyer; and Cale McNamara, his best friend and co-conspirator. All three are in separate traps representing the three wise monkeys and are killed despite his efforts to save them.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Who will increase the size of their muscles less? Michael has become bored with his passive life style, and has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby. He begins to exercise with weights several times a week. Michael's brother, Robert, isn't as motivated as Michael though. Robert decides to continue being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months. Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","completion":"Robert will increase the size of his muscles less compared to Michael. This is because Michael exercises with weights several times a week, while Robert only exercises with weights every couple of months. Regular weight lifting helps increase muscle size and strength, whereas infrequent exercise does not contribute as effectively to muscle growth. Therefore, Michael's consistent weight lifting routine is more effective in building and maintaining muscle strength and size than Robert's inactive lifestyle with occasional weightlifting."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. ___ Thank you so much. Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation and as one people. Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election, whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time. By the way, we have to fix that. Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone, whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference. I just spoke with Gov. Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard-fought campaign. We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From George to Lenore to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service and that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Gov. Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward. I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden. And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly: Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been prouder to watch the rest of America fall in love with you, too, as our nation's first lady. Sasha and Malia, before our very eyes you're growing up to become two strong, smart beautiful young women, just like your mom. And I'm so proud of you guys. But I will say that for now one dog's probably enough. To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics. The best. The best ever. Some of you were new this time around, and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are family. No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together and you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful president. Thank you for believing all the way, through every hill, through every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics that tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym, or saw folks working late in a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home, you'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or a roof over their head when they come home. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. It's important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight, and it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. We can never forget that as we speak people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter, the chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. A country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation, with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet. We want to pass on a country that's safe and respected and admired around the world, a nation that is defended by the strongest military on earth and the best troops this _ this world has ever known. But also a country that moves with confidence beyond this time of war, to shape a peace that is built on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being. We believe in a generous America, in a compassionate America, in a tolerant America, open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag. To the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner. To the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president _ that's the future we hope for. That's the vision we share. That's where we need to go _ forward. That's where we need to go. Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there. As it has for more than two centuries, progress will come in fits and starts. It's not always a straight line. It's not always a smooth path. By itself, the recognition that we have common hopes and dreams won't end all the gridlock or solve all our problems or substitute for the painstaking work of building consensus and making the difficult compromises needed to move this country forward. But that common bond is where we must begin. Our economy is recovering. A decade of war is ending. A long campaign is now over. And whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you, I have learned from you, and you've made me a better president. And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead. Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together. Reducing our deficit. Reforming our tax code. Fixing our immigration system. Freeing ourselves from foreign oil. We've got more work to do. But that doesn't mean your work is done. The role of citizen in our democracy does not end with your vote. America's never been about what can be done for us. It's about what can be done by us together through the hard and frustrating, but necessary work of self-government. That's the principle we were founded on. This country has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military in history, but that's not what makes us strong. Our university, our culture are all the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores. What makes America exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on earth. The belief that our destiny is shared; that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations. The freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights. And among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism. That's what makes America great. I am hopeful tonight because I've seen the spirit at work in America. I've seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors, and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job. I've seen it in the soldiers who reenlist after losing a limb and in those SEALs who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them watching their back. I've seen it on the shores of New Jersey and New York, where leaders from every party and level of government have swept aside their differences to help a community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm. And I saw just the other day, in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8-year-old daughter, whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care. I had an opportunity to not just talk to the father, but meet this incredible daughter of his. And when he spoke to the crowd listening to that father's story, every parent in that room had tears in their eyes, because we knew that little girl could be our own. And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright. That's who we are. That's the country I'm so proud to lead as your president. And tonight, despite all the hardship we've been through, despite all the frustrations of Washington, I've never been more hopeful about our future. I have never been more hopeful about America. And I ask you to sustain that hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism, the kind of hope that just ignores the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path. I'm not talking about the wishful idealism that allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk from a fight. I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us so long as we have the courage to keep reaching, to keep working, to keep fighting. America, I believe we can build on the progress we've made and continue to fight for new jobs and new opportunity and new security for the middle class. I believe we can keep the promise of our founders, the idea that if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like or where you love. It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, able, disabled, gay or straight, you can make it here in America if you're willing to try. I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggests. We're not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are and forever will be the United States of America. And together with your help and God's grace we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth. Thank you, America. God bless you. God bless these United States. ||||| In his 20-minute speech to supporters after winning re-election, President Barack Obama touched on familiar themes he has emphasized throughout his presidency.

To answer the question, we need to provide more information about the groundwood process and its main ingredient. The groundwood process is a mechanical pulping method in which logs are ground against a rough surface or grindstone, producing small wood fibers. This process is used to manufacture various types of paper products, including newsprint and other low-cost, high-volume paper grades. The main ingredient in the groundwood process is wood, specifically softwood. Softwood comes from coniferous trees, such as pine, spruce, and fir, which have long, strong fibers suitable for papermaking. The wood is ground into small fibers, which are then mixed with water, heated, and refined to create a pulp. This pulp is used as a raw material to produce different types of paper. As the aforementioned sentence states, the mechanical pulping process does not remove lignin from the wood fibers. Lignin is a complex organic polymer that binds to cellulose fibers, providing structural support and rigidity to the tree. When lignin is not removed during the pulping process, it can negatively impact the quality of the paper produced. The presence of lignin causes the paper to turn yellow and become brittle over time, leading to a lower quality final product compared to that produced using chemical pulping methods, in which lignin is removed. In conclusion, while the sentence provided talks about the effects of mechanical pulping on paper quality, it does not directly answer the question about the main ingredient involved in the groundwood process. The main ingredient in the groundwood process is wood, specifically softwood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Among the options given, the ones conforming to this type are: - Grass: It's mentioned explicitly in the question that grass has roots that absorb water, so it is an obvious answer. - Apples: While apples themselves do not absorb water, they grow on trees, which use their roots to draw up water from the ground. However, within the context of the question, 'apples' might not be the most suitable choice since they are a fruit and do not directly possess roots. - Spruce: This is a type of tree. Trees such as the spruce have extensive root systems that they use to absorb water from the soil, fulfilling their nutritional needs and aiding their growth. - Oak: This is also a tree, which absorbs water through its root system for sustenance and growth. - Trees: This is a general term that includes all types of trees, all of which have roots that absorb water.

The CIA's senior management saw problems with the armed Predator as well, problems that Clarke and even Black and Allen were inclined to minimize. One (which also applied to reconnaissance flights) was money. A Predator cost about 3 million. If the CIA flew Predators for its own reconnaissance or covert action purposes, it might be able to borrow them from the Air Force, but it was not clear that the Air Force would bear the cost if a vehicle went down.

Whiz-bang medical researchers discovered that women could decrease their risk of diabetes by 29 percent when they followed a regimen of drinking three to four cups of coffee a day. The ladies who had the courage to drink 10 or more cups of coffee a day progressed even better. They reduced their risk of diabetes by 79 percent. The men participating in the studies also reduced their risk, but not to the extent as did the women. When men drank three to four cups a day, they reduced their risk of diabetes by 27 percent. The men who drank 10 or more cups of java per day reduced their risk by 55 percent. These results confirm a January report by the equally 'prestigious' Harvard School of Public Health. That report concluded that drinking six 8-ounce cups of coffee a day could reduce diabetes risk in men by about 50 percent and in women by 30 percent.

Please answer the following question: If heat is necessary for the survival of animals, then what is necessary for the survival of animals? Answer choices: - honey - acid rain - woods - warmth - genes - food - oxygen - heat A:","completion":"Animals require a variety of factors to survive, and each of these factors plays a crucial role in their well-being, growth, and reproduction. Some of these factors are more essential than others, but ultimately, animals need a combination of these factors to thrive in their habitats. Let's discuss the given answer choices in detail to better understand the necessities for animal survival. 1. Honey: Though honey is a popular natural food source consumed by humans and some animals (such as bears), it is not a fundamental necessity for the survival of all animals. So, honey does not fit the criteria for an essential requirement for animal survival. 2. Acid rain: Acid rain is a result of air pollution, which causes negative impacts on the environment, such as harming plants, aquatic life, and soil chemistry. It is detrimental to animal survival, instead of being necessary. 3. Woods: Woods or forests provide a natural habitat for many animals and offer them food, shelter, and protection from predators. However, not all animals are found in wooded environments, so woods cannot be considered a universal necessity for animal survival. 4. Warmth: Warmth or heat is necessary for animal survival but does not cover all of the elements an animal needs to thrive. Warmth helps regulate metabolic processes, and various animals rely on different temperature ranges to survive, depending on their adaptations. Warmth is essential but only one of the many necessary factors. 5. Genes: Genes are vital because they carry the hereditary information responsible for an animal’s inherited traits and functions. Genes play a crucial role in the survival of animals as they ensure the continuity and adaptation of the species. However, genes alone are not enough to guarantee an animal's survival. 6. Food: Food is one of the most critical factors necessary for animal survival. Animals need food to obtain energy and nutrients to grow, reproduce, and maintain overall health. Without an adequate food supply, animals cannot meet their energy needs and eventually starve. Food is a fundamental necessity for animal survival. 7. Oxygen: Oxygen is another crucial element necessary for animal survival. Most animals require oxygen for respiration, a process that extracts energy from food molecules, such as glucose. Oxygen plays a vital role in enabling animals to generate the energy they need to survive. 8. Heat: As mentioned earlier, heat or warmth is necessary for animal survival, as it helps regulate metabolic processes and maintains the proper functioning of an animal's body. Different animals have various adaptations to survive in their preferred temperature ranges. In conclusion, among the given answer choices, warmth (heat), genes, food, and oxygen are crucial elements necessary for the survival of animals. These elements play varying roles in maintaining an animal's well-being, growth, reproduction, and overall health. While some factors are more specific to particular species or environments (such as woods), the necessity for food, oxygen, genes, and warmth are universal, making them essential survival factors for animals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I probably put off reading this book because it has a picture of a dog on the front cover, and not being much of a \\"pet-person\\" myself, I didn't think I'd be able to get into this story. Well, was I ever wrong! It wasn't about pets at all, but about giving love and shelter to troubled youths.

With a warm and soft heart, she reached out to the lost and lonely, and helped them find themselves and their way in life. I appreciated the slow and patient way Nick and Claire developed their friendship and grew to trust each other over time. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","completion":"The review is positive. The reviewer initially had reservations about the book due to the cover image, but they ended up enjoying the story and its focus on love and shelter for troubled youths.

Q:Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Michael Cromwell is a self-absorbed, successful commodities broker living in New York City. Wanting to marry his new fiancée Charlotte, he needs to obtain a final divorce from his first wife Patricia who left him some years earlier. Patricia now lives with a semi-Westernised tribe in Canaima National Park, Venezuela. Michael travels there to get her signature on divorce papers, but upon arriving, discovers that he has a 13-year-old son named Mimi-Siku. Michael attempts to bond with Mimi-Siku in his brief stay with the tribe and promises to take him to New York \\"when he is a man.\\" Michael is also given a new name, Baboon, as is a custom in the tribe. That night, Mimi-Siku undergoes the traditional rite of passage of his tribe, who then considers him to be a man. The tribal elder gives Mimi a special task: to become a tribal leader one day, Mimi must bring fire from the Statue of Liberty and he looks forward to traveling with his father. Against his own protests, Michael brings Mimi-Siku to New York with him. Michael works as a trader at the World Trade Center in building 7. Michael's fiancée, Charlotte, is less than pleased about the unexpected visitor in a loin cloth outfit, who tries to urinate in front of her at a fake tree (as is usual in his tribe), suggests eating her cat, and Maitika, his enormous pet tarantula escapes from his box and into her apartment. Mimi-Siku wears traditional dress during much of his stay in New York. As Michael attempts to adapt Mimi-Siku to city life, cross-cultural misunderstandings occur when Mimi-Siku reverts to customs considered acceptable by his tribe. On climbing the Statue of Liberty to reach the flame, Mimi-Siku is disappointed when he sees that the fire is not real.

One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...

Q:Question: \\"Who lived by the teachings of Mahayana?\\" Context: \\"There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the provided context, it is evident that adherents of the Mahayana teachings were predominantly bodhisattvas, although the term Mahayana did not signify a distinct school or sect within Buddhism. Rather, Mahayana comprised a set of principles and doctrines aimed at guiding the spiritual development of bodhisattvas - compassionate beings on the path to Buddha-hood. These teachings were initially referred to as Bodhisattvayāna, which translates to the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas.\\" It is worth noting that Mahayana was never established as a rival sect to the early schools of Buddhism, as it did not possess a unique Vinaya (monastic discipline) or ordination lineage. Instead, each bhikṣu (monk) or bhikṣuṇī (nun) adhering to the Mahayana principles belonged formally to an early Buddhist school. This tradition persists in present-day East Asia's Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage and Tibetan Buddhism's Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage. Chinese monks who ventured to India provide insights into the intermingling of Mahayana and non-Mahayana practitioners. They observed that both groups often coexisted within the same monasteries, emphasizing the compatibility and lack of division between practitioners of Mahayana and other early forms of Buddhism. In conclusion, individuals who lived by the teachings of Mahayana were primarily bodhisattvas practicing and promoting the values and doctrines nestled within the Mahayana tradition. Although not constituting a distinctly separate sect, Mahayana played an important role in shaping the spiritual growth and compassionate endeavors of Buddhist practitioners, many of whom cohabited with non-Mahayana monks and nuns in shared monastic settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Graziano was the son of Ida Scinto and Nicola Barbella. Barbella, nicknamed Fighting Nick Bob, was a boxer with a brief fighting record. Born in Brooklyn, Graziano later moved to an Italian enclave centered on East 10th Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A in Manhattan's East Village. He grew up as a street fighter and learned to look after himself before he could read or write. Graziano heard from a couple of his friends about a tournament going on with a gold medal for the winner. He entered under the name of Joe Giuliani and was trained by Tobias (Toby) Zaccaria of Kings County (Brooklyn), NY. He fought four matches and ended up winning the New York Metropolitan Amateur Athletic Union Boxing Competition (1939). He sold the gold medal for 15 and decided that boxing was a good way to make cash. A couple of weeks into amateur fighting, Graziano was picked up for stealing from a school. He went to Coxsackie Correctional Facility, where he spent three weeks, with boyhood friend Jake LaMotta, and then he went on to the New York City Reformatory where he spent five months. After he got out of the reformatory, he headed back to the gym to earn money and while there, met Eddie Cocco who started his professional career. He entered the ring under the name Robert Barber. A couple of weeks later, Graziano was charged with a probation violation and sent back to reform school where he was charged with starting a minor riot. He was then sent to Rikers Island. When Graziano got out of jail he enlisted in the military but went AWOL after punching a captain. He escaped from Fort Dix in New Jersey and started his real boxing career under the name of \\"Rocky Graziano\\". He won his first couple of bouts. After gaining popularity under the name of Graziano, he was found by the military. After his fourth bout, he was called into manager's office to speak with a couple of military personnel.

He was a tough guy who liked to fight and grew up in a neighborhood with lots of Italians. One day, his friends told him about a fighting competition where they would give a gold medal to the winner. Graziano entered the competition, won it, and sold the medal for some money. He thought this fighting thing was a good way to make money! But he got into some trouble for stealing and had to go to a place called a reformatory, which is kind of like a school for kids who make bad choices. When he got out, he tried to make money by fighting again but got into more trouble and had to go back to the reformatory. After that, Graziano decided to join the army, but he didn't like it very much and got into trouble there too. He decided to leave the army without permission and started fighting under a new name, \\"Rocky Graziano.\\" He got really popular as a fighter, but the army found him and wanted to talk to him. He thought he would get in big trouble, so he ran away for a little bit, but eventually came back. Instead of getting in trouble, the army gave him a chance to keep fighting as long as he did it while staying in the army. So, Graziano learned that even though he made some mistakes, he could still do what he loved as long as he followed the rules."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, in this case a monsoon, can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of global warming. Direct effects: 1. Increased cloud cover during monsoons can temporarily reflect sunlight back into space, reducing the amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth's surface. This can lead to short-term cooling effects in the affected regions. 2. Heavy rainfall can cause increased vegetation growth, which may lead to increased absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, acting as a temporary carbon sink. Indirect effects: 1. Changes in global weather patterns due to a monsoon can alter the distribution of greenhouse gases, causing regional variations in their concentrations, ultimately affecting global warming. 2. Severe flooding during monsoons can damage human infrastructure, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions from affected areas due to decreased industrial and transportation activities. 3. Monsoons can cause increased soil erosion and sedimentation in bodies of water, potentially affecting their ability to absorb solar radiation and contribute to the overall heat balance of the planet. 4. A monsoon could lead to a temporary change in human behavior, such as increased use of public transportation or decreased agricultural production, that ultimately influences greenhouse gas emissions and the Earth's temperature. Overall, the effects of a monsoon on global warming can be complex and depend on various factors, including the severity of the monsoon, the location and extent of its impact, and the duration of its occurrence.

Albrecht the Elder was 62 or 63 when his panel was painted early in 1490. Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to...

It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago.

Background: Secretariat (March 30, 1970 - October 4, 1989) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who, in 1973, became the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. His record-breaking win in the Belmont Stakes, where he left the field 31 lengths behind him, is widely regarded as one of the greatest races of all time. During his racing career, he won five Eclipse Awards, including Horse of the Year honors at ages two and three. He was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974. Context: Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced in track bandages, but typically wore a blinker hood, mostly to help him focus, but also because he had a tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. \\"He was a big fat sucker\\", Davis said. \\"I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to.\\" Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as \\"having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before ...\\" Groom Eddie Sweat was another important member of the Secretariat team, providing most of the daily hands-on care. Sweat once told a reporter, \\"I guess a groom gets closer to a horse than anyone. The owner, the trainer, they maybe see him once a day. But I lived with him, worked with him.\\" Laurin sent Chenery regular updates on Secretariat's progress, saying that the colt was still learning to run, or that he still needed to lose his baby fat. Chenery recalled that when Secretariat was in training, Lucien once said: \\"Your big Bold Ruler colt don't show me nothin'. He can't outrun a fat man.\\" But Secretariat made steady progress over the spring. On June 6, he wore blinkers for the first time to keep his attention focused and responded with a half-mile workout in a solid 47 3/5 seconds. On June 24, he ran a \\"bullet\\", the fastest workout of the day, at 6 furlongs in 1:12 4/5 on a sloppy track. Laurin called Chenery at her Colorado home and advised her that Secretariat was ready to race. The 1973 Kentucky Derby on May 5 attracted a crowd of 134,476 to Churchill Downs, then the largest crowd in North American racing history. The bettors made the entry of Secretariat and Angle Light the 3-2 favorite, with Sham the second choice at 5-2. The start was marred when Twice a Prince reared in his stall, hitting Our Native, positioned next to him, and causing Sham to bang his head against the gate, loosening two teeth. Sham then broke poorly and cut himself, also bumping into Navajo. Secretariat avoided problems by breaking last from post position 10, then cut over to the rail. Early leader Shecky Greene set a reasonable pace, then gave way to Sham around the far turn. Secretariat came charging as they entered the stretch and battled with Sham down the stretch, finally pulling away to win by 2 1/2 lengths. Our Native finished eight lengths further back in third. On his way to a still-standing track record of 1:59 2/5, Secretariat ran each quarter-mile segment faster than the one before it. The successive quarter-mile times were :25 1/5, :24, :23 4/5, :23 2/5, and :23. This means he was still accelerating as of the final quarter-mile of the race. No other horse had won the Derby in less than 2 minutes before, and it would not be accomplished again until Monarchos ran the race in 1:59.97 in 2001. Sportswriter Mike Sullivan later said: I was at Secretariat's Derby, in '73 ... That was ... just beauty, you know? He started in last place, which he tended to do. I was covering the second-place horse, which wound up being Sham. It looked like Sham's race going into the last turn, I think. The thing you have to understand is that Sham was fast, a beautiful horse. He would have had the Triple Crown in another year. And it just didn't seem like there could be anything faster than that. Everybody was watching him. It was over, more or less. And all of a sudden there was this, like, just a disruption in the corner of your eye, in your peripheral vision. And then before you could make out what it was, here Secretariat came. And then Secretariat had passed him. No one had ever seen anything run like that - a lot of the old guys said the same thing. It was like he was some other animal out there. Secretariat next went to Saratoga, popularly nicknamed \\"the graveyard of champions\\", in preparation for the Whitney Stakes on August 4, where he would face older horses the first time. On July 27, he put in a stunning workout of 1:34 for a mile on a sloppy track, a time that would have broken Saratoga's track record. On race day though, he was beaten by the Allen Jerkens-trained Onion, a four-year-old gelding who had set a track record at 6 1/2 furlongs in his previous start. The track condition for the Whitney was labelled fast but was running slow, especially along the inside rail. Secretariat broke poorly and Onion led from the start, setting a slow pace running well off the rail. Down the backstretch, Turcotte chose to make his move along the rail rather than sweeping wide. Secretariat responded more sluggishly than usual and Turcotte went to the whip. Secretariat closed to within a head on the final turn before Onion pulled ahead in the straight to win by a length. A record crowd of more than 30,000 witnessed what was described as an \\"astonishing\\" upset. Despite Jerkens's reputation as the \\"Giant Killer,\\" Secretariat's stunning loss can possibly be attributed to a viral infection, which caused a low-grade fever and diarrhea. \\"I was learning then that anything could happen in horse racing\\", said Chenery. \\"We knew he had a low-grade infection. But we decided he was strong enough to win anyway, and we were wrong.\\" Secretariat lost his appetite and acted sluggishly for several days. Charles Hatton wrote: \\"He seemed distressingly ill walking off, and he missed the Travers. Returned to Belmont to point for the 250,000 Marlboro, the sport's pin-up horse looked bloody awful, rather like one of those sick paintings which betoken an inner theatre of the macabre. It required supernatural recuperative powers to recover as he did. He was subjected to four severe preps in two weeks. Astonishingly, he gained weight and blossomed with every trial.\\" Question: Did he win ?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Secretariat won numerous races throughout his career, most notably the Triple Crown in 1973, which includes the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes. He set records in each of these races, which still stand today. His victory in the Belmont Stakes with a 31-length lead is considered one of the greatest races of all time. However, it is important to note that Secretariat did not win every race he participated in, as mentioned in the text. For example, he lost the Whitney Stakes to Allen Jerkens-trained Onion in an \\"astonishing\\" upset, possibly due to an underlying viral infection. Despite this loss and other obstacles, Secretariat's impressive racing career earned him a place in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was the 1960s, an era marked by youth: Vietnam War protests, psychedelic drugs, sexual revolutions. The young Walker relished the culture of exultation, of joie de vivre, and yet was also acutely aware of its passing. He was haunted by the knowledge that ageing would eventually steal away his vitality – that with each passing day his body was slightly less robust, slightly more decayed. One evening he went for a drive in his convertible and vowed that by his 40th birthday, he would find a cure for ageing. Walker became a scientist to understand why he was mortal. “Certainly it wasn’t due to original sin and punishment by God, as I was taught by nuns in catechism,” he says. “No, it was the result of a biological process, and therefore is controlled by a mechanism that we can understand.” Scientists have published several hundred theories of ageing, and have tied it to a wide variety of biological processes. But no one yet understands how to integrate all of this disparate information. Walker, now 74, believes that the key to ending ageing may lie in a rare disease that doesn’t even have a real name, “Syndrome X”. He has identified four girls with this condition, marked by what seems to be a permanent state of infancy, a dramatic developmental arrest. He suspects that the disease is caused by a glitch somewhere in the girls’ DNA. His quest for immortality depends on finding it. It’s the end of another busy week and MaryMargret Williams is shuttling her brood home from school. She drives an enormous SUV, but her six children and their coats and bags and snacks manage to fill every inch. The three big kids are bouncing in the very back. Sophia, 10, with a mouth of new braces, is complaining about a boy-crazy friend. She sits next to Anthony, seven, and Aleena, five, who are glued to something on their mother’s iPhone. The three little kids squirm in three car seats across the middle row. Myah, two, is mining a cherry slushy, and Luke, one, is pawing a bag of fresh crickets bought for the family gecko. Finally there’s Gabrielle, who’s the smallest child, and the second oldest, at nine years old. She has long, skinny legs and a long, skinny ponytail, both of which spill out over the edges of her car seat. While her siblings giggle and squeal, Gabby’s dusty-blue eyes roll up towards the ceiling. By the calendar, she’s almost an adolescent. But she has the buttery skin, tightly clenched fingers and hazy awareness of a newborn. Back in 2004, when MaryMargret and her husband, John, went to the hospital to deliver Gabby, they had no idea anything was wrong. They knew from an ultrasound that she would have clubbed feet, but so had their other daughter, Sophia, who was otherwise healthy. And because MaryMargret was a week early, they knew Gabby would be small, but not abnormally so. “So it was such a shock to us when she was born,” MaryMargret says. Gabby came out purple and limp. Doctors stabilised her in the neonatal intensive care unit and then began a battery of tests. Within days the Williamses knew their new baby had lost the genetic lottery. Her brain’s frontal lobe was smooth, lacking the folds and grooves that allow neurons to pack in tightly. Her optic nerve, which runs between the eyes and the brain, was atrophied, which would probably leave her blind. She had two heart defects. Her tiny fists couldn’t be pried open. She had a cleft palate and an abnormal swallowing reflex, which meant she had to be fed through a tube in her nose. “They started trying to prepare us that she probably wouldn’t come home with us,” John says. Their family priest came by to baptise her. Day after day, MaryMargret and John shuttled between Gabby in the hospital and 13-month-old Sophia at home. The doctors tested for a few known genetic syndromes, but they all came back negative. Nobody had a clue what was in store for her. Her strong Catholic family put their faith in God. “MaryMargret just kept saying, ‘She’s coming home, she’s coming home’,” recalls her sister, Jennie Hansen. And after 40 days, she did. Gabby cried a lot, loved to be held, and ate every three hours, just like any other newborn. But of course she wasn’t. Her arms would stiffen and fly up to her ears, in a pose that the family nicknamed her “Harley-Davidson”. At four months old she started having seizures. Most puzzling and problematic, she still wasn’t growing. John and MaryMargret took her to specialist after specialist: a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist, a geneticist, a neurologist, an ophthalmologist and an orthopaedist. “You almost get your hopes up a little – ’This is exciting! We’re going to the gastro doctor, and maybe he’ll have some answers’,” MaryMargret says. But the experts always said the same thing: nothing could be done. The first few years with Gabby were stressful. When she was one and Sophia two, the Williamses drove from their home in Billings, Montana, to MaryMargret’s brother’s home outside of St Paul, Minnesota. For nearly all of those 850 miles, Gabby cried and screamed. This continued for months until doctors realised she had a run-of-the-mill bladder infection. Around the same period, she acquired a severe respiratory infection that left her struggling to breathe. John and MaryMargret tried to prepare Sophia for the worst, and even planned which readings and songs to use at Gabby’s funeral. But the tiny toddler toughed it out. While Gabby’s hair and nails grew, her body wasn’t getting bigger. She was developing in subtle ways, but at her own pace. MaryMargret vividly remembers a day at work when she was pushing Gabby’s stroller down a hallway with skylights in the ceiling. She looked down at Gabby and was shocked to see her eyes reacting to the sunlight. “I thought, ‘Well, you’re seeing that light!’” MaryMargret says. Gabby wasn’t blind, after all. Despite the hardships, the couple decided they wanted more children. In 2007 MaryMargret had Anthony, and the following year she had Aleena. By this time, the Williamses had stopped trudging to specialists, accepting that Gabby was never going to be fixed. “At some point we just decided,” John recalls, “it’s time to make our peace.” Mortal questions When Walker began his scientific career, he focused on the female reproductive system as a model of “pure ageing”: a woman’s ovaries, even in the absence of any disease, slowly but inevitably slide into the throes of menopause. His studies investigated how food, light, hormones and brain chemicals influence fertility in rats. But academic science is slow. He hadn’t cured ageing by his 40th birthday, nor by his 50th or 60th. His life’s work was tangential, at best, to answering the question of why we’re mortal, and he wasn’t happy about it. He was running out of time. So he went back to the drawing board. As he describes in his book, Why We Age, Walker began a series of thought experiments to reflect on what was known and not known about ageing. Ageing is usually defined as the slow accumulation of damage in our cells, organs and tissues, ultimately causing the physical transformations that we all recognise in elderly people. Jaws shrink and gums recede. Skin slacks. Bones brittle, cartilage thins and joints swell. Arteries stiffen and clog. Hair greys. Vision dims. Memory fades. The notion that ageing is a natural, inevitable part of life is so fixed in our culture that we rarely question it. But biologists have been questioning it for a long time. It’s a harsh world out there, and even young cells are vulnerable. It’s like buying a new car: the engine runs perfectly but is still at risk of getting smashed on the highway. Our young cells survive only because they have a slew of trusty mechanics on call. Take DNA, which provides the all-important instructions for making proteins. Every time a cell divides, it makes a near-perfect copy of its three-billion-letter code. Copying mistakes happen frequently along the way, but we have specialised repair enzymes to fix them, like an automatic spellcheck. Proteins, too, are ever vulnerable. If it gets too hot, they twist into deviant shapes that keep them from working. But here again, we have a fixer: so-called ‘heat shock proteins’ that rush to the aid of their misfolded brethren. Our bodies are also regularly exposed to environmental poisons, such as the reactive and unstable ‘free radical’ molecules that come from the oxidisation of the air we breathe. Happily, our tissues are stocked with antioxidants and vitamins that neutralise this chemical damage. Time and time again, our cellular mechanics come to the rescue. Which leads to the biologists’ longstanding conundrum: if our bodies are so well tuned, why, then, does everything eventually go to hell? One theory is that it all boils down to the pressures of evolution. Humans reproduce early in life, well before ageing rears its ugly head. All of the repair mechanisms that are important in youth – the DNA editors, the heat shock proteins, the antioxidants – help the young survive until reproduction, and are therefore passed down to future generations. But problems that show up after we’re done reproducing cannot be weeded out by evolution. Hence, ageing. Most scientists say that ageing is not caused by any one culprit but by the breakdown of many systems at once. Our sturdy DNA mechanics become less effective with age, meaning that our genetic code sees a gradual increase in mutations. Telomeres, the sequences of DNA that act as protective caps on the ends of our chromosomes, get shorter every year. Epigenetic messages, which help turn genes on and off, get corrupted with time. Heat shock proteins run down, leading to tangled protein clumps that muck up the smooth workings of a cell. Faced with all of this damage, our cells try to adjust by changing the way they metabolise nutrients and store energy. To ward off cancer, they even know how to shut themselves down. But eventually cells stop dividing and stop communicating with each other, triggering the decline we see from the outside. Scientists trying to slow the ageing process tend to focus on one of these interconnected pathways at a time. Some researchers have shown, for example, that mice on restricted-calorie diets live longer than normal. Other labs have reported that giving mice rapamycin, a drug that targets an important cell-growth pathway, boosts their lifespan. Still other groups are investigating substances that restore telomeres, DNA repair enzymes and heat shock proteins. During his thought experiments, Walker wondered whether all of these scientists were fixating on the wrong thing. What if all of these various types of cellular damages were the consequences of ageing, but not the root cause of it? He came up with an alternative theory: that ageing is the unavoidable fallout of our development. The idea sat on the back burner of Walker’s mind until the evening of 23 October 2005. He was working in his home office when his wife called out to him to join her in the family room. She knew he would want to see what was on TV: an episode of Dateline about a young girl who seemed to be “frozen in time”. Walker watched the show and couldn’t believe what he was seeing. Brooke Greenberg was 12 years old, but just 13 pounds (6kg) and 27 inches (69cm) long. Her doctors had never seen anything like her condition, and suspected the cause was a random genetic mutation. “She literally is the Fountain of Youth,” her father, Howard Greenberg, said. Walker was immediately intrigued. He had heard of other genetic diseases, such as progeria and Werner syndrome, which cause premature ageing in children and adults respectively. But this girl seemed to be different. She had a genetic disease that stopped her development and with it, Walker suspected, the ageing process. Brooke Greenberg, in other words, could help him test his theory. Uneven growth Brooke was born a few weeks premature, with many birth defects. Her paediatrician labeled her with Syndrome X, not knowing what else to call it. After watching the show, Walker tracked down Howard Greenberg’s address. Two weeks went by before Walker heard back, and after much discussion he was allowed to test Brooke. He was sent Brooke’s medical records as well as blood samples for genetic testing. In 2009, his team published a brief report describing her case. Walker’s analysis found that Brooke’s organs and tissues were developing at different rates. Her mental age, according to standardised tests, was between one and eight months. Her teeth appeared to be eight years old; her bones, 10 years. She had lost all of her baby fat, and her hair and nails grew normally, but she had not reached puberty. Her telomeres were considerably shorter than those of healthy teenagers, suggesting that her cells were ageing at an accelerated rate. All of this was evidence of what Walker dubbed “developmental disorganisation”. Brooke’s body seemed to be developing not as a coordinated unit, he wrote, but rather as a collection of individual, out-of-sync parts. “She is not simply ‘frozen in time’,” Walker wrote. “Her development is continuing, albeit in a disorganised fashion.” The big question remained: why was Brooke developmentally disorganised? It wasn’t nutritional and it wasn’t hormonal. The answer had to be in her genes. Walker suspected that she carried a glitch in a gene (or a set of genes, or some kind of complex genetic programme) that directed healthy development. There must be some mechanism, after all, that allows us to develop from a single cell to a system of trillions of cells. This genetic programme, Walker reasoned, would have two main functions: it would initiate and drive dramatic changes throughout the organism, and it would also coordinate these changes into a cohesive unit. Ageing, he thought, comes about because this developmental programme, this constant change, never turns off. From birth until puberty, change is crucial: we need it to grow and mature. After we’ve matured, however, our adult bodies don’t need change, but rather maintenance. “If you’ve built the perfect house, you would want to stop adding bricks at a certain point,” Walker says. “When you’ve built a perfect body, you’d want to stop screwing around with it. But that’s not how evolution works.” Because natural selection cannot influence traits that show up after we have passed on our genes, we never evolved a “stop switch” for development, Walker says. So we keep adding bricks to the house. At first this doesn’t cause much damage – a sagging roof here, a broken window there. But eventually the foundation can’t sustain the additions, and the house topples. This, Walker says, is ageing. Brooke was special because she seemed to have been born with a stop switch. But finding the genetic culprit turned out to be difficult. Walker would need to sequence Brooke’s entire genome, letter by letter. That never happened. Much to Walker’s chagrin, Howard Greenberg abruptly severed their relationship. The Greenbergs have not publicly explained why they ended their collaboration with Walker, and declined to comment for this article. Second chance In August 2009, MaryMargret Williams saw a photo of Brooke on the cover of People magazine, just below the headline “Heartbreaking mystery: The 16-year-old baby”. She thought Brooke sounded a lot like Gabby, so contacted Walker. After reviewing Gabby’s details, Walker filled her in on his theory. Testing Gabby’s genes, he said, could help him in his mission to end age-related disease – and maybe even ageing itself. This didn’t sit well with the Williamses. John, who works for the Montana Department of Corrections, often interacts with people facing the reality of our finite time on Earth. “If you’re spending the rest of your life in prison, you know, it makes you think about the mortality of life,” he says. What’s important is not how long you live, but rather what you do with the life you’re given. MaryMargret feels the same way. For years she has worked in a local dermatology office. She knows all too well the cultural pressures to stay young, and wishes more people would embrace the inevitability of getting older. “You get wrinkles, you get old, that’s part of the process,” she says. But Walker’s research also had its upside. First and foremost, it could reveal whether the other Williams children were at risk of passing on Gabby’s condition. For several months, John and MaryMargret hashed out the pros and cons. They were under no illusion that the fruits of Walker’s research would change Gabby’s condition, nor would they want it to. But they did want to know why. “What happened, genetically, to make her who she is?” John says. And more importantly: “Is there a bigger meaning for it?” John and MaryMargret firmly believe that God gave them Gabby for a reason. Walker’s research offered them a comforting one: to help treat Alzheimer’s and other age-related diseases. “Is there a small piece that Gabby could present to help people solve these awful diseases?” John asks. “Thinking about it, it’s like, no, that’s for other people, that’s not for us.” But then he thinks back to the day Gabby was born. “I was in that delivery room, thinking the same thing – this happens to other people, not us.” Still not entirely certain, the Williamses went ahead with the research. Amassing evidence Walker published his theory in 2011, but he’s only the latest of many researchers to think along the same lines. “Theories relating developmental processes to ageing have been around for a very long time, but have been somewhat under the radar for most researchers,” says Joao Pedro de Magalhaes, a biologist at the University of Liverpool. In 1932, for example, English zoologist George Parker Bidder suggested that mammals have some kind of biological “regulator” that stops growth after the animal reaches a specific size. Ageing, Bidder thought, was the continued action of this regulator after growth was done. Subsequent studies showed that Bidder wasn’t quite right; there are lots of marine organisms, for example, that never stop growing but age anyway. Still, his fundamental idea of a developmental programme leading to ageing has persisted. For several years, Stuart Kim’s group at Stanford University has been comparing which genes are expressed in young and old nematode worms. It turns out that some genes involved in ageing also help drive development in youth. Kim suggested that the root cause of ageing is the “drift”, or mistiming, of developmental pathways during the ageing process, rather than an accumulation of cellular damage. Other groups have since found similar patterns in mice and primates. One study, for example, found that many genes turned on in the brains of old monkeys and humans are the same as those expressed in young brains, suggesting that ageing and development are controlled by some of the same gene networks. Perhaps most provocative of all, some studies of worms have shown that shutting down essential development genes in adults significantly prolongs life. “We’ve found quite a lot of genes in which this happened – several dozen,” de Magalhaes says. Nobody knows whether the same sort of developmental-programme genes exist in people. But say that they do exist. If someone was born with a mutation that completely destroyed this programme, Walker reasoned, that person would undoubtedly die. But if a mutation only partially destroyed it, it might lead to a condition like what he saw in Brooke Greenberg or Gabby Williams. So if Walker could identify the genetic cause of Syndrome X, then he might also have a driver of the ageing process in the rest of us. And if he found that, then could it lead to treatments that slow – or even end – ageing? “There’s no doubt about it,” he says. Public stage After agreeing to participate in Walker’s research, the Williamses, just like the Greenbergs before them, became famous. In January 2011, when Gabby was six, the television channel TLC featured her on a one-hour documentary. The Williams family also appeared on Japanese television and in dozens of newspaper and magazine articles. Other than becoming a local celebrity, though, Gabby’s everyday life hasn’t changed much since getting involved in Walker’s research. She spends her days surrounded by her large family. She’ll usually lie on the floor, or in one of several cushions designed to keep her spine from twisting into a C shape. She makes noises that would make an outsider worry: grunting, gasping for air, grinding her teeth. Her siblings think nothing of it. They play boisterously in the same room, somehow always careful not to crash into her. Once a week, a teacher comes to the house to work with Gabby. She uses sounds and shapes on an iPad to try to teach cause and effect. When Gabby turned nine, last October, the family made her a birthday cake and had a party, just as they always do. Most of her gifts were blankets, stuffed animals and clothes, just as they are every year. Her aunt Jennie gave her make-up. Walker teamed up with geneticists at Duke University and screened the genomes of Gabby, John and MaryMargret. This test looked at the exome, the 2% of the genome that codes for proteins. From this comparison, the researchers could tell that Gabby did not inherit any exome mutations from her parents – meaning that it wasn’t likely that her siblings would be able to pass on the condition to their kids. “It was a huge relief – huge,” MaryMargret says. Still, the exome screening didn’t give any clues as to what was behind Gabby’s disease. Gabby carries several mutations in her exome, but none in a gene that would make sense of her condition. All of us have mutations littering our genomes. So it’s impossible to know, in any single individual, whether a particular mutation is harmful or benign – unless you can compare two people with the same condition. All girls Luckily for him, Walker’s continued presence in the media has led him to two other young girls who he believes have the same syndrome. One of them, Mackenzee Wittke, of Alberta, Canada, is now five years old, with has long and skinny limbs, just like Gabby. “We have basically been stuck in a time warp,” says her mother, Kim Wittke. The fact that all of these possible Syndrome X cases are girls is intriguing – it could mean that the crucial mutation is on their X chromosome. Or it could just be a coincidence. Walker is working with a commercial outfit in California to compare all three girls’ entire genome sequences – the exome plus the other 98% of DNA code, which is thought to be responsible for regulating the expression of protein-coding genes. For his theory, Walker says, “this is do or die – we’re going to do every single bit of DNA in these girls. If we find a mutation that’s common to them all, that would be very exciting.” But that seems like a very big if. Most researchers agree that finding out the genes behind Syndrome X is a worthwhile scientific endeavour, as these genes will no doubt be relevant to our understanding of development. They’re far less convinced, though, that the girls’ condition has anything to do with ageing. “It’s a tenuous interpretation to think that this is going to be relevant to ageing,” says David Gems, a geneticist at University College London. It’s not likely that these girls will even make it to adulthood, he says, let alone old age. It’s also not at all clear that these girls have the same condition. Even if they do, and even if Walker and his collaborators discover the genetic cause, there would still be a steep hill to climb. The researchers would need to silence the same gene or genes in laboratory mice, which typically have a lifespan of two or three years. “If that animal lives to be 10, then we’ll know we’re on the right track,” Walker says. Then they’d have to find a way to achieve the same genetic silencing in people, whether with a drug or some kind of gene therapy. And then they’d have to begin long and expensive clinical trials to make sure that the treatment was safe and effective. Science is often too slow, and life too fast. End of life On 24 October 2013, Brooke passed away. She was 20 years old. MaryMargret heard about it when a friend called after reading it in a magazine. The news hit her hard. “Even though we’ve never met the family, they’ve just been such a part of our world,” she says. MaryMargret doesn’t see Brooke as a template for Gabby – it’s not as if she now believes that she only has 11 years left with her daughter. But she can empathise with the pain the Greenbergs must be feeling. “It just makes me feel so sad for them, knowing that there’s a lot that goes into a child like that,” she says. “You’re prepared for them to die, but when it finally happens, you can just imagine the hurt.” Today Gabby is doing well. MaryMargret and John are no longer planning her funeral. Instead, they’re beginning to think about what would happen if Gabby outlives them. (Sophia has offered to take care of her sister.) John turned 50 this year, and MaryMargret will be 41. If there were a pill to end ageing, they say they’d have no interest in it. Quite the contrary: they look forward to getting older, because it means experiencing the new joys, new pains and new ways to grow that come along with that stage of life. Richard Walker, of course, has a fundamentally different view of growing old. When asked why he’s so tormented by it, he says it stems from childhood, when he watched his grandparents physically and psychologically deteriorate. “There was nothing charming to me about sedentary old people, rocking chairs, hot houses with Victorian trappings,” he says. At his grandparents’ funerals, he couldn’t help but notice that they didn’t look much different in death than they did at the end of life. And that was heartbreaking. “To say I love life is an understatement,” he says. “Life is the most beautiful and magic of all things.” If his hypothesis is correct – who knows? – it might one day help prevent disease and modestly extend life for millions of people. Walker is all too aware, though, that it would come too late for him.

For one Oklahoma family, it seems that has happened. \\"She's sweet, she laughs, has a huge smile,\\" said Felicia Qualls about her daughter Layla. When little Layla entered the world, her parents, Jesse and Felicia, felt their family was complete. Being their second child, they knew what to expect, plenty of diaper changes and late night feedings - or so they thought. \\"She just wouldn't eat,\\" said Jesse Sapp, Layla's father. \\"I mean we couldn't get her to drink a bottle to save her life.\\" Not eating was just the first sign and even when she did start eating, she wouldn't gain any weight. They soon realized Layla would take them on a different path. A timeless path where it appeared their little girl was not aging. \\"She's growing but it's just not at the rate you would expect,\\" said Jesse. Celebrating her third birthday on May 3, Layla still looks like a 9 to 10 month old baby, weighing only about 19 pounds. And doctors are baffled as to why. \\"She's seen, it seems, like every specialist there is, everything comes back normal,\\" said Jesse. \\"And that is frustrating because you know after all those tests, they're all normal but we know she's not normal,\\" added Felicia. Layla isn't alone though. Researcher Dr. Richard Walker has found seven children worldwide including Layla, who have this extremely rare condition, called Syndrome X. He hopes to reveal the condition's genetic blueprint to find out which genes are slowing down the aging process. Dr. Steve Horvath is conducting the clinical tests for the study. We visited him at his research lab on the UCLA campus. \\"I'm the father of a three year old girl so I felt very sympathetic for the families,\\" Dr. Horvath said. He's passionate to find out why the Syndrome X children do not aging physically and mentally. So his team collected blood samples and extracted the DNA for analysis. \\"We did everything right, the whole protocol worked very well, very high quality DNA,\\" he said. The results, though, were disappointing. Researchers found the blood of the Syndrome X children doesn't look any younger than that of a normal child. \\"It would have been nice to say we found a footprint of the mechanism that could explain that condition,\\" said Dr. Horvath. \\"As a researcher you need to continue searching.\\" They will continue searching for the answers Layla's family would like to have by collecting more tissue samples for analysis. \\"It would be nice to kind of know, maybe they'll discover something but it doesn't matter,\\" said Jesse. Because they know it doesn't change the way they feel about her or the joy she brings to their lives. \\"She might be like this forever and she might not walk and do other things that other children do but that's okay with us, we still love her,\\" said Felicia. Researchers are also doing a genetic study on the Syndrome X children. Those results are not complete yet. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Syndrome X is an extremely rare condition that affects the aging process of the body, making the individual appear to never age.

This implies that German does not want the redhead to be present when the linemen come out, perhaps fearing some potential negative consequence or conflict. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that German told the redhead to stay if this individual wanted to meet the linemen. This assumption is in direct contrast to the premise because it implies that German wanted the redhead to be present when the linemen arrive. If this hypothesis were accurate, German's advice to the redhead would be the exact opposite of what was mentioned in the premise. In summary, given the information provided in the premise, it is not possible to conclude that the hypothesis \\"German told the redhead to stay if he wanted to meet the linemen\\" is true. Instead, the premise indicates that German advised the redhead to leave before the linemen came out, which suggests that the hypothesis is false and cannot be supported by the provided context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber.

I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval.

Plot title: Wrecked Movie plot: A man, referred to in the movie only as \\"Man\\" (Adrien Brody), wakes up, severely injured, in a wrecked car in the bottom of a ravine with his right leg stuck between the dashboard and the door. He has a broken leg and is suffering from amnesia. He hallucinates about a woman (Caroline Dhavernas) finding him. He also drives away a cougar after giving two warning shots from a revolver he retrieved inside the car. After a few days of being stuck in that position, he manages to escape the car by prying out the car door with a shifter lever. In the car, he finds bags of money and hears on the car radio about an armed robbery by a man named Raymond Plazzy. Finding a credit card under the passenger seat in the name of Raymond Plazzy, The Man assumes that he is Raymond Plazzy and that he committed the robbery. A man (Adrian Holmes) wearing hunting gear emerges from the woods and starts to loot the wrecked car. The Man tries to get help from the hunter, who just runs away with some of the stolen money. A dog appears, and The Man follows it into the woods. He finds a working cell phone inside a cave, discovering the tragic fate of the hunter who was possibly attacked by the cougar. The Man cannot obtain a signal in the woods. Frequently hallucinating about the woman, he finally shoots her with the revolver after realizing the hallucination led him back to the car. He then decides to get out of the ravine. After crawling for days, he finds a road and a dead body with a driver's license that says Raymond Plazzy. He then pieces together what happened to him: He was running errands with his wife (the Woman) when he witnessed an armed robbery and was taken hostage by Plazzy. They were driving down the road, arguing about the situation; and he used the moment to grab the wheel, causing the car to crash. Suddenly, the cougar appears; the man gives the dead body to the cougar to eat. The man now has a cell phone signal and calls for help. The man is picked up by a forest ranger. He gets into the truck; and, when he clicks his... My question: Where does the hallucination lead him? Answer:","completion":"The hallucination of the woman leads the Man back to the wrecked car. Throughout the movie, the Man repeatedly sees hallucinations of this woman, who we later find out is actually his wife. These hallucinations seem to be a driving force in his desire to survive and seek help. At one point, the hallucination actually leads him away from the car and into the woods, where he encounters several challenges including a cougar and a hunter. However, the point you're interested in occurs later in the movie. After following the hallucination further into the woods, he suddenly realizes that the hallucination of the woman has actually guided him in a circle back to the crash site, leading him back to the wrecked car. This likely happens as a narrative device that underscores his disoriented state and further stresses his desperate and perilous predicament. It also serves to bring him back to the starting point of his ordeal as he begins to piece together his memories, practically and symbolically. Feeling betrayed by the hallucination that he believed was trying to aid him, he then shoots at the hallucination of the woman with his revolver. This act can be seen as a manifestation of his frustration and realization that the hallucinations were not leading him to rescue or safety, but rather were a product of his amnesia and injury. Therefore, while the hallucinations may have initially served as a beacon of hope and direction for the Man, they ultimately led him back to his original, dire predicament - stuck alone and injured with a wrecked car in the middle of a ravine. This eerie realization that he's gone in circles intensifies his desperation to survive, escape the ravine, and find real, not hallucinated, help."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects.

(WMTV) -- Some students say an announcement telling students some of their classmates were dead as part of a safe driving drill was inappropriate. During the morning announcements students were told the name of four students who had supposedly died in a car accident that morning. Several minutes later, a second announcement told students their classmates were not dead and that, instead, the announcement was part of a simulation drill. The Brodhead HIgh School principle says the drill was put on by the student council as part of a year-long campaign on safe driving. Throughout the day more announcements told students more of their classmates were dying in car accidents. The students that were \\"dying\\" as part of the drill were aware ahead of time but were not allowed to use their phones to notify other classmates that they were okay. \\"A lot of our fellow friends and students actually started crying because they thought these people were actually dead and so I think a lot of them actually called their parents in school too,\\" Brodhead High School student Madison Trombley says. The district superintendent says the drill was not intended to cause any harm or stress or scare students. He says a few parents called in to complain saying it was harmful to their children. He says he thinks this was a real-life look for students in to what could happen if they do not drive carefully. Some students say if they would have been warned about the drill the reaction would have been much different. \\"it wasn't really effective. They were trying to teach using scare tactics which doesn't teach it just makes you not trust the teachers and any of the announcements you're going to get,\\" Brodhead High School student Sam Bolen says. ||||| Brodhead students say safe driving drill went too far https://t.co/zrWQEgdPOo pic.twitter.com/Q1LOXv8s3y — nbc15_madison (@nbc15_madison) October 28, 2016 Just after the morning Pledge of Allegiance last Wednesday, students at Brodhead High School received a startling announcement. Four of their classmates had been killed in a car crash involving texting and driving. In Sam Bolen’s algebra class, people began stirring. Brodhead is a city in rural Wisconsin, about 100 miles southwest of Milwaukee. With a population of about 3,000, it is the kind of place where everyone knows everybody else. “They went into detail about how one of them was rushed to the hospital,” Bolen, a junior, told The Washington Post. “I was pretty upset. It is a really small school, like, most of the people really knew who they were. You kind of know who everybody is in a smaller school.” Bolen texted his mother, and many other students did the same with their parents, he said. “A lot of our fellow friends and students actually started crying,” Brodhead student Madison Trombley told NBC 15 News, which first reported the incident. A high school in Brodhead, Wis., is under fire for announcing the 'deaths' of four students in a crash crash as part of a safe driving initiative. Ten minutes after the announcement was made, students were told their classmates had not in fact been in an accident. (Brodhead High School) The person making the announcement waited 10 minutes, then said that the previous message had actually been part of a drill about safe driving techniques. There had not been a car crash. The four students were not dead after all. [My father died because of a distracted driver. We have to do more so it doesn’t happen to others.] According to NBC 15, the “deceased” students who participated in the drill were told not to use their phones to reply to classmates. Questions about whether the school crossed a line to get its safe-driving message out have divided its students and the community. Bolen and his mother said they have received intense backlash since he gave an interview to NBC 15 last week. “There’s been a parent that said, ‘If you have a child who’s offended by this, you are raising a weak, drama-filled child,'” Bolen said this week. “It is kind of uncomfortable when you know that teachers are even talking bad about students who are upset.” Brodhead School District Superintendent Leonard Lueck told The Post in an email that the drill was intended to bring awareness to teen driving safety but acknowledged “problems with this activity due to communication issues that occurred.” “While we stand by the worthiness of the activity, we recognize the flaws with how it was communicated,” Lueck wrote. “We will evaluate the value of this activity and either make changes to how it is communicated or not do the activity again.” Lueck added that the district formally apologized to parents and students “for any undue stress this activity may have caused.” [This surprising activity is more dangerous than using your phone while driving] On Facebook, a student named Miranda Ryser, who identified herself as a student council member, posted several impassioned messages on Facebook in defense of the drill following the NBC 15 report. “To the people who are upset about what happened at school today, good,” Ryser wrote. “I hope you’re upset about it because I would rather have you upset and pissed off at the student council and the principal for a day, instead of being depressed because one of your classmates ACTUALLY died. I get that some people were already affected by other car accidents but it happens. People die on the daily basis and it happens. Touchy subject or not it happens and it shows that it can happen unexpectedly. She added: “If we did anything like this in another way, no one would listen or pay attention to ANYTHING. Try warning high school students of the dangers they just don’t care.” Nearly 60­ percent of crashes involving teen drivers have some form of distraction in the six seconds leading up to the accident, according to a report by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. In about 12 percent of the cases studied, the distraction was cellphone use. The percentage of teens in crashes using cellphones has remained about the same since 2007, but researchers found that teen drivers are using them less for talking and listening and more for reasons that require looking at the phone. Sarah Bolen, Sam’s mother, said they are not criticizing the student council or the message; on the contrary, she said, Sam is named after his uncle, who was killed by a drunk driver, which made the fake death announcements even more upsetting. But she did not approve of the way the school staff members and administrators handled the exercise. “It’s almost insulting, in a way,” she said of the school’s approach, which she called a scare tactic. “I don’t feel that you need to go to those kinds of extremes to teach a lesson. It minimizes other people’s feelings who have actually gone through it.” What some classmates found bizarre was that the fake death announcements continued through the day. In the second hour, it was the school principal who came on to tell the student body that four other classmates had “died.” And then, during the school’s official morning announcements that day — akin to a student-run newscast — two classmates delivered this: “These are your morning announcements. Currently today it is the 26th. There have been a series of wrecks and multiple reckless driving things happening currently around Brodhead. We’ve currently lost a handful of fellow students, and we’re going to show you some images of their lives now. We’d like you to give them a moment of silence.” For about a minute, photos of several Brodhead students flashed on the screen against a haunting piano and violin tune. “Today make sure you take a moment and think about all your loved ones as those were pretty sad moments there,” the student broadcasters said in their sign-off. “As well as drive safe . . . have a good day.” [Bringing back driver’s ed could be just the thing to get teens behind the wheel] Finally, after a rundown of the day’s cafeteria menu and a volleyball team fundraiser, two adults appeared on screen in the same video to give an “update” about four other students who had been “T-boned by a drunk driver.” Somberly, one recited the names of the students who had been “killed.” By then, most of the student body knew the announcements were not real, and the “dead” students were still at school, dressed in black. “You just kind of became numb to it,” Bolen said. “They just kept doing it. It just didn’t really make sense.” At the end of the day, Bolen said, there was an assembly where the school’s principal called out students who were upset. “He yelled that ‘if anyone has a problem about it, their parents can call me tomorrow,'” Bolen said. “He was very standoffish about it.” Reached by phone Monday, Brodhead High School Principal Jim Matthys cut short inquiries about the announcements. “I don’t have any comment for you, I’m sorry,” Matthys said before hanging up. Sarah Bolen said that attitude was part of the reason she has not tried to contact the school or district. Given the comments she has read since the incident was first reported, she fears that even more vitriol will be directed at those who disagreed with the drill — but she said she thought it was important to speak out. “I want to note that there’s better ways to go about teaching our children, and that’s not through fear,” she said. “It’s not fear-based. It’s with compassion, and having compassion is not weakness. It’s actually the opposite.” Read more: This school staged a ‘Color Wars’ pep rally. Then students showed up in ‘White Pride’ shirts.

The museum was founded by millionaire seafood industrialist F. Nelson Blount. The non-profit Steamtown Foundation took over operations following his death in 1967. Because of Vermont's air quality regulations restricting steam excursions, declining visitor attendance, and disputes over the use of track, some pieces of the collection were relocated to Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the mid-1980s and the rest were auctioned off. After the move, Steamtown continued to operate in Scranton but failed to attract the expected 200,000–400,000 visitors. Within two years the tourist attraction was facing bankruptcy, and more pieces of the collection were sold to pay off debt. In 1986, the United States House of Representatives, under the urging of Pennsylvania Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. As a result, the National Park Service (NPS) conducted historical research on the equipment that remained in the Foundation's possession. This research was used as a Scope of Collections Statement for the Steamtown National Historic Site. The scope was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. The report provided concise histories of each piece of equipment and made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the soon-to-be government-funded collection. By 1995, Steamtown had been acquired and developed by the NPS with a 66 million allocation. Several more pieces have been removed from the collection as a result of the government acquisition. Part of the Blount collection is still on display at the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton., what would be the answer ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules. Question: \\"Which federal government agencies knew that American 11 had been hijacked before it struck the World Trade Center and how did most of them find out what had happened?\\" Response: \\"The FTC knew, but everyone else found out from ABC\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What shows a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art? , can you please find it? The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi. They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs. Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture). In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \\"Art of Dying\\". It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy. As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones.","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What shows a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art?\\" can be found in this part of the article: \\"The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi.

In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Now, I have a new situation: Brad and Frank are two cousins. they both own land in the same county. Frank's parcel is a pine forest, while Brad's is a nice dry grassland with wild flowers and a few shrubs. Answer this question please: Which parcel has thinner hummus layers?

Article: The House will vote Wednesday on a five-year farm bill unveiled by House and Senate negotiators from both parties on Monday night. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said he would personally support the compromise bill, giving it further momentum ahead of the House vote. The bill includes nearly 1 trillion in funding for agriculture subsidy, crop insurance and food stamp programs over the next 10 years. ADVERTISEMENT It would reduce food stamp funding by about 8 billion, much less than what Cantor and other House Republicans had demanded. Overall, the bill is expected to save 23 billion over 10 years compared to existing funding. “Despite the Senate's unwillingness to challenge the status-quo and include all of the critical reforms to important programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the finalized Farm Bill will include a new initiative that allows states to implement work requirements for able-bodied adults as well as initiatives to help move individuals from dependence to self-sufficiency and independence,” Cantor said in praising the measure. Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said he also supports the farm bill. “I have voted against the last two Farm Bills because, in my view, they made farm and food stamp policy worse rather than better. This legislation, however, is worthy of the House’s support,” he said. House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) touted the bill’s “significant savings and reforms” in a statement. “We are putting in place sound policy that is good for farmers, ranchers, consumers, and those who have hit difficult time,” he said. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said the bill “saves taxpayers billions, eliminates unnecessary subsidies, creates a more effective farm safety-net and helps farmers and businesses create jobs.\\" Although House Agriculture ranking member Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) said he did not support all of the provisions, he also announced he will vote for it. His support brings a significant contingent of rural Democrats that could be necessary for the bill’s passage this week. “While it’s no secret that I do not support some of the final bill’s provisions, I believe my reservations are outweighed by the need to provide long term certainty for agriculture and nutrition programs. This process has been going on far too long,” he said. Peterson's support comes after a compromise was found on dairy subsidies and dairy lobbyists voiced their support. The compromise discourages milk overproduction by limiting how much milk can be insured in the future and also has a provision allowing the Agriculture Department to buy up some excess production. Farm lobbyists backing the bill said they would work overtime to get it approved by both chambers. Opponents include some House conservatives and the meat processing industry. But in another hopeful sign for the bill, Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.), a member of the conference committee and top proponent of new food stamp restrictions, said he would support the bill. “Some of the reforms in this farm bill are fantastic,” he said in reference to provisions affecting food stamps, dairy programs and direct payments. “You’ve got to crawl before you walk and walk before you can run.” The House bill had initially made a 39 billion cut to the food stamp programs. The food stamps cuts are achieved, as expected, by making it more difficult to qualify for nutrition assistance by virtue of receiving home heating aid. The threshold is raised to 20 per month from 1 per month. The bill contains funding for a new pilot program aimed at encouraging able-bodied recipients to find work and more than 200 million more for food banks. Southerland said after leaving Boehner’s office on Monday that the Speaker appeared to be onboard with a compromise on the dairy program after demanding changes to an earlier draft. “We believe the Speaker is satisfied with the dairy [provision],” Southerland said. Boehner forbade any dairy reform containing milk supply management from inclusion in the bill. The compromise bill does not contain the management mechanism in the Senate bill but has other \\"tweaks\\" meant to address overproduction concerns, sources said. On farm subsidies, the bill offers producers a choice between a shallow loss revenue insurance long favored by Northern crop growers and price-based supports supported by those in the South. The target prices for the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) option are the same as in the House-passed farm bill. The Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) program is triggered when revenue falls below 86 percent, up from 85 percent in the House bill and down from 89 percent in the Senate bill. Negotiators have altered payment limit provisions contained in both the House and Senate farm bills. The limits are now capped at 125,000 per individual or 250,000 per couple, but caps within that total for PLC, ARC or marketing loan deficiency payments have been removed. The compromise also changes restrictions on the so-called “actively engaged” provision. The criteria for management has been strengthened compared to current law, a source said, but the provision appears to be scaled back from the labor requirement in the earlier versions of the bills. The bill resolves a long-running dispute over whether commodity subsidies should be tied to current production or historical production. With a number of caveats, it ties subsidies to historical production but allows famers to update their \\"base acres\\" once in the life of the farm bill. Critics of the original House bill had said linking support to current production would distort trade and invited retaliation. The 2008 farm bill expired on Oct. 1 and, without a new measure, spring planting decisions are up in the air. The Agriculture Department technically should now be enforcing a reversion to 1949 law that would spike milk prices. A top agriculture lobbyist sounded upbeat Monday but not 100 percent sure of passage. “I think there is real progress, but we have a lot of work to do before this comes to the House floor,” the lobbyist said. Part of the concern erupted due to a fight over two livestock provisions not included in the bill. Meat and poultry lobbyists vowed to oppose the farm bill on Monday, after two of their core priorities were left on the cutting room floor. Language aimed at curtailing a meat country-of-origin labeling (MCOOL) requirement and one aimed at restricting activities by the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) was left out. The development was supported by growers but opposed by processors. Senate negotiators won on MCOOL and GIPSA and also prevailed by keeping out of the bill an amendment by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) aimed at stopping California from banning eggs hatched from hens in tiny battery cages. In another last minute decision, Senate Agriculture Committee ranking member Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) succeeded in keeping in place a catfish inspection program that importers and Vietnam have called an illegal trade barrier. — This story was updated at 7:20 p.m. ||||| WASHINGTON — House and Senate negotiators on Monday agreed on a new five-year farm bill that will eliminate or consolidate dozens of agriculture subsidy programs, expand government-subsidized crop insurance and cut about 8 billion from the food stamp program over the next decade. The bipartisan agreement, two years after lawmakers began work on the nearly 1 trillion bill, is a major step forward in reauthorizing hundreds of farm and nutrition programs that must be renewed every five years. And, at least for now, it brings an end to the partisan fighting that stalled two previous attempts to pass the legislation. The bill would reduce spending by about 23 billion over the next 10 years. The House is expected to vote on the measure on Wednesday. It is unclear when the Senate will take up the legislation. Many Senate Democrats are likely to be unhappy with the food stamps measure, which cuts roughly twice as much as senators approved in May. Yet the food stamp cuts may not be large enough to appease House conservatives, who in June helped defeat a bill backed by Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio that would have cut 20 billion from the program. The House eventually passed a bill covering only nutrition programs that would have sliced nearly 40 billion from food stamps. The negotiations were headed by the leaders of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, Representative Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, and Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan. The deal “puts us on the verge of enacting a five-year farm bill that saves taxpayers billions, eliminates unnecessary subsidies, creates a more effective farm safety net and helps farmers and businesses create jobs,” Ms. Stabenow said. Mr. Lucas said, “I am proud of our efforts to finish a farm bill conference report with significant savings and reforms.” Farmers also welcomed the news of the agreement. “The bill is a compromise,” said Ray Gaesser, an Iowa farmer who is president of the American Soybean Association. “It ensures the continued success of American agriculture, and we encourage both the House and the Senate to pass it quickly.” Antihunger advocates criticized the agreement. “They are gutting a program to provide food for hungry people to pay for corporate welfare,” said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. The new bill would make the most significant changes to farm programs in decades. It would create a new milk insurance subsidy program and place a cap on farm subsidy payments. The full details of the bill have not been released. It is expected to leave in place the federal sugar program, which is a combination of import restrictions and production quotas that are intended to keep the price of American sugar well above that available on the world market and which has long been criticized by candy makers and bakers. It also is expected to keep a controversial catfish-inspection office at the Agriculture Department that is supported by Southern lawmakers and the catfish industry, but has faced opposition because it duplicates a similar program at the Food and Drug Administration. Some countries that export catfish, like Vietnam, say the program protects American catfish producers. Among the most significant changes to farm subsidies would be the elimination of so-called direct payments. They have been in place since 1996, cost about 5 billion a year and go to farmers and landowners whether they grow crops or not. Some of the savings from the elimination of direct payments will be added to the crop insurance program, in which the federal government covers losses from poor yields or declines in revenue. It also has its critics. “It’s a classic bait-and-switch proposal to protect farm subsidies,” said Vincent H. Smith, a professor of farm economics at Montana State University and a longtime critic of agriculture subsidies. “They’ve eliminated the politically toxic direct payments program and added the money to a program that will provide farmers with even larger subsidies.” Antihunger advocates like Mr. Berg say crop insurance expansion would come at the expense of millions of people who depend on food stamps. The farm bill would avoid some of the drastic measures that were part of the House bill, like work requirements and drug testing for food stamp recipients, but antihunger advocates said the 8 billion cut would reduce benefits by about 90 a month for 850,000 households. The bill does contain financing for a pilot program aimed at encouraging recipients who can work to find work. Nearly two million people will be affected by the cuts. “This vote is a tragic, heartless and economically counterproductive departure from America’s bipartisan history of fighting hunger,” Mr. Berg said. “Members of Congress who voted for this should be ashamed.” ||||| The compromise farm bill announced Monday by congressional negotiators sets policy for food stamps and farm programs. The bill would cut food stamps by around 800 million a year and continue generous farm subsidies. Agriculture programs in the bill: — The end of so-called direct payments, paid to farmers whether they farm or not. The payments now cost around 4.5 billion a year. — A new revenue insurance subsidy that would pay farmers in the event of \\"shallow losses,\\" or revenue losses incurred before their paid crop insurance kicks in. That program might kick in sooner than previously thought as some crop prices have dropped in recent months. — A separate subsidy program would trigger payments when crop prices drop. This is similar to current subsidies, though the new programs would kick in sooner, especially for cotton and rice, the crops that depend the most on the direct payments that would be phased out. Producers would have to choose between these subsidies or the revenue insurance. — Stricter limits on how much money an individual farmer can receive — 125,000 annually on all payments and loans, when some were previously unrestricted. The agreement is less strict than either the House or Senate bills, which had put limits on how much a farmer could receive from individual programs. Language that would limit how many people in a farm operation may receive such payments was also passed by both chambers but taken out of the compromise bill, which would kick the issue to the Agriculture Department. — More money for government-subsidized crop insurance programs. A Senate amendment that would have lowered crop insurance payouts for the wealthiest farmers was struck from the final version. ||||| Updated 9:07 p.m. Negotiators agreed Monday evening on a new five-year farm bill that slashes about 23 billion in federal spending by ending direct payments to farmers, consolidating dozens of Agriculture Department programs and by cutting about 8 billion in food stamp assistance. Corn plants grow on a Minnesota farm. (Washington Post via Tony Thompson) House leaders said they planned to pass the 950-page bill by Wednesday evening -- meaning that for the second time in two weeks lawmakers will vote on a bill running hundreds of pages just hours after its formal release. Congress already passed a 1.1 trillion omnibus spending package this month within days of its release and with little formal debate. But the farm bill is already more than two years overdue and a final version has been delayed for several weeks amid haggling over the finer details of government support programs for the dairy industry, concerns with payments to the managers and owners of family farms and labeling for livestock born in other countries but slaughtered in the United States. The agreement cuts about 19 billion in farm programs, including the end of direct payments to farmers -- some of whom weren't actually farming at all. The program has existed since the 1990s and has been singled out by President Obama and members of both parties in recent years as a prime example of government inefficiency. Another 6 billion will be saved by cutting from 23 to 13 the number of conservation programs operated by the Agriculture Department and its agencies. Another 8 billion will be saved by closing loopholes and ending other misuse of the food stamp program, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Supporters said the measure will slash billions of dollars and help support 16 million jobs in the agriculture industry -- making it the only bipartisan, money-saving jobs bill to pass Congress in recent years. \\"We never lost sight of the goal; we never wavered in our commitment to enacting a five-year, comprehensive farm bill,\\" House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank D. Lucas (R-Okla.) said Monday night as he asked colleagues for support. “This bill proves that by working across party lines, we can reform programs to save taxpayer money while strengthening efforts to grow our economy,\\" Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said in a statement. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) announced support for the legislation and said the House would vote on the bill Wednesday. Boehner called the deal \\"a positive step in the right direction\\" while Cantor said, \\"This was not an easy task, and it took hard work to arrive here.\\" Both leaders have expressed concerns with the size and scope of previous farm bills and their tepid support Monday evening signals that many fiscal conservatives will be unhappy that the new agreement doesn't go farther to reduce spending, especially to SNAP. Over the summer, the House voted to slash about 40 billion over the next decade from the program. The Democratic-controlled Senate voted over the summer to cut only 4 billion. The final agreement achieves savings by tweaking a loophole in a federal heating assistance program that has allowed about a dozen states to pay out as little as 1 to some recipients and boost that person's eligibility for food aid. The changes will require states to pay more in order to qualify people for \\"heat and eat\\" benefits and will reduce, but not eliminate, SNAP payments by about 90 monthly for about 850,000 households. The bill also for the first time establishes pilot programs to encourage food stamp recipients to seek jobs and bars USDA from using money to recruit new beneficiaries or to advertise the program on television, radio and billboards. Addressing years of documented evidence of misuse and abuse of the program, USDA will need to ensure that illegal immigrants, lottery winners, college students and the dead cannot receive food stamps and that people cannot collect benefits in multiple states. Advocates for low-income families blasted the deal Monday as unfair to the nation's poorest and several urban state lawmakers have said they likely will vote against the overall bill because of the food stamp cuts. \\"Only in Washington could a final bill that doubles the already egregious cuts to hungry families while somehow creating less total savings than originally proposed be called progress,\\" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said Monday evening in announcing her opposition to the overall bill. For the first time, the bill authorizes colleges and universities to grow industrial hemp for research purposes in states that permit growth and cultivation of the plant. Currently 11 states -- Colorado, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia -- have such laws. Aides noted that the new hemp-themed provisions are among hundreds of policy and spending details buried in the legislation, but the decision is likely to contribute to a growing national debate about the legalization of marijuana both for medicinal and recreational purposes. Industry groups said Monday night that they were reviewing the legislation, and while the agreement is expected to upset some associations for different reasons, several signaled early support Monday evening, as did organizations pushing for changes to foreign food aid included in the bill. \\"The bill is a compromise,\\" said Ray Gaesser, president of the American Soybean Association. \\"It ensures the continued success of American agriculture, and we encourage both the House and the Senate to pass it quickly.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A five-year farm bill, unveiled by the House and Senate negotiators on Monday night, is scheduled to be voted on by the House on Wednesday.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"To determine how good the Go language is to learn and whether it is a good language to learn, let's evaluate some criteria that can help make an informed decision. Additionally, we will compare the two questions to determine if they convey the same meaning. Step 1: Analyze the popularity of Go. Popular languages tend to have more community support, job opportunities, and resources for learning. According to recent programming language rankings, Go (or Golang) is in the top 20 most popular languages, so it has a fairly good standing in the programming community. Step 2: Assess the performance and application of Go. Go is designed for high-performance software development and has gained popularity for its simplicity, efficient compilation, and concurrent programming capabilities. It is particularly well-suited for building network applications and microservices, due to its strong support for concurrent and parallel programming. Step 3: Check for ease of learning. Go is known for its simplicity and readability, with a syntax that is not overly complex. This can help beginners grasp the language more easily than languages with a more complicated and extensive syntax. Step 4: Evaluate the job market. As the language is growing in popularity, more companies are adopting Go for parts of their tech stack, which means there's potential for job opportunities. However, it might not have the same demand as more established languages like Python, Java or JavaScript. Conclusion: Based on the criteria analyzed, Go is a good language to learn due to its popularity, high-performance capabilities, simplicity, and growing job market. However, it might be best to combine Go with other widely-used languages to maximize the range of job opportunities and adaptability in the programming world. Now, let's compare the two questions: 1. How good is the Go language to learn? 2. Is Go a good language to learn? Both questions are asking about the value and potential benefits of learning the Go language. They convey the same general idea, though there's a slight difference in the way they are phrased. Question 1 is asking for an evaluation of how good Go is to learn, while question 2 is more of a yes or no question asking if Go is a good language to learn. Despite the minor differences in phrasing, both questions ultimately seek the same answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The staff are his old gang from his French Resistance days, paroled based on patriotic war work as long as they keep clean. Bertani, Foussard, and the others blame Robie, because they are currently all under suspicion while the new Cat is active. Still, when the police arrive at Bertani's restaurant, Foussard's teenage daughter Danielle (Brigitte Auber), who has a crush on Robie, spirits him to safety. Robie can prove his innocence if he can catch the new Cat in the act. He enlists the aid of an insurance man, H. H. Hughson (John Williams), who reluctantly obtains a list of the most expensive jewelry owners currently on the Riviera. Widow Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis) and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly) top the list. Robie strikes up a friendship with them. Jessie's delighted but Frances offers a pretense of modesty. When Robie and Frances run into Danielle at the beach, Robie keeps up the mask of being a wealthy American tourist, despite Danielle's jealous barbs about his interest in Frances. From the trailer Grace Kelly and Cary Grant Grace Kelly as Frances Stevens Kelly and Grant Frances sees through Robie's cover as an American industrialist. She seduces him, dangling before him her jewels, teases him with steamy tales of rooftop escapades, and offers herself as an accomplice who might share his crimes. Fireworks fill the night sky. The next morning, Jessie discovers her jewels are gone. Robie is accused by Frances of being merely a distraction so he could steal her mother's jewelry. The police are called, but Robie has disappeared. To catch the new Cat, Robie stakes out an estate at night. He struggles with an... My question: How are Jessie and Frances related?

When metamorphic rocks are subjected to extremely high temperatures and pressures deep within the Earth's crust, they can eventually melt and turn into magma. This magma, being less dense than the surrounding solid rocks, will rise towards the Earth's surface, potentially resulting in a volcanic eruption or intrusions where the magma cools and solidifies underground.

Can you ask a girl to break up with her boyfriend to be with you? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose your answer from: [1]. no. [2]. yes.","completion":"[1]. no. The two questions you provided are not paraphrases of each other, but rather distinct inquiries about different topics concerning romantic relationships. The first question focuses on which private parts of a girl might make her feel uncomfortable when touched by her boyfriend in a relationship. It's important to remember that physical intimacy in a relationship should always be built on trust and consent. Every individual's comfort level and boundaries will vary, and it is crucial for a couple to communicate openly about their preferences. There are several areas that might make a girl feel uncomfortable when touched by her boyfriend, depending on personal preferences: 1. Breasts: Some women may feel sensitive or uncomfortable when their breasts or nipples are touched, especially if done so without asking for permission beforehand. 2. Genitals: Touching or fondling a woman's genitals can make her feel extremely uncomfortable, particularly if she isn't ready for such intimacy, or if her partner does not obtain consent beforehand. 3. Inner thighs and buttocks: These areas can be quite sensitive and could create discomfort if touched unexpectedly. The key to building a successful relationship is communication. Couples should express their desires, limits, or concerns regarding physical intimacy to ensure a mutually respectful, healthy, and fulfilling connection. The second question asks whether it is appropriate to request a girl to break up with her boyfriend to be in a relationship with you. While expressing your feelings towards someone is understandable, it's essential to consider the emotional impact on all parties involved. Encouraging someone to end their current relationship for your benefit could cause emotional turmoil, resentment, and potentially damage any potential future relationship you may have with that person. Additionally, it's necessary to consider the possibility that the girl might choose to stay in her current relationship, which would ultimately lead to rejection for you. It's important to be aware that relationships should be built on a solid foundation that respects all individuals involved, rather than attempting to force the outcome you desire. Overall, these two questions tackle very different aspects of romantic relationships: one regarding physical boundaries and another related to entering into a relationship in a respectful, ethical manner.

Article: Advertisement Continue reading the main story HONG KONG — Even for China’s scandal-numbed diners, inured to endless outrages about food hazards, news that the lamb simmering in the pot may actually be rat tested new depths of disgust. In an announcement intended to show that the government is serious about improving food safety, the Ministry of Public Security said on Thursday that the police had caught a gang of traders in eastern China who bought rat, fox and mink flesh and sold it as mutton. But that and other cases of meat smuggling, faking and adulteration featured in Chinese newspapers and Web sites on Friday were unlikely to instill confidence in consumers already queasy over many reports about meat, fruit and vegetables laden with disease, toxins, banned dyes and preservatives. Sixty-three people were arrested and accused of “buying fox, mink and rat and other meat products that had not undergone inspection,” which they doused in gelatin, red pigment and nitrates, and sold as mutton in Shanghai and adjacent Jiangsu Province for about 1.6 million, according to the ministry’s statement. The report, posted on the Internet, did not explain how exactly the traders acquired the rats and other creatures. “How many rats does it take to put together a sheep?” said one typically baffled and angry user of Sina Weibo, China’s Twitter-like microblog service that often acts as a forum for public venting. “Is it cheaper to raise rats than sheep?” Residents of Shanghai recently endured the sight of thousands of dead hogs floating down a nearby river, apparently the dumped victims of disease in piggeries upstream. The arrests were part of a nationwide operation since late January to “attack food safety crimes and defend the safety of the dining table,” the ministry said. The police arrested 904 people suspected of selling fake, diseased, toxic or adulterated meat, and broke up 1,721 illicit factories, workshops and shops. Yet the ministry acknowledged that diners still had reason to worry. In food safety campaigns in past years, “some serious problems have been dealt with swiftly and vigorously, but for a variety of reasons, food safety crimes remain serious, and are displaying new circumstances and features,” an unnamed senior official said in the statement. “For example, there is selling of meat injected with water and meat from animals dead from disease, as well as passing off relatively cheap types of meat as relatively expensive beef and mutton.” China’s prime minister since March, Li Keqiang, has said that improving food safety is a priority — one of the main grievances of citizens that he has said his government will tackle. But similar vows by his predecessor, Wen Jiabao, ran up against inadequate resources, buck-passing and muddle among rival agencies, and protectionism by local officials, Mao Shoulong, a professor of public policy at Renmin University in Beijing, said in an interview. “The United States and Europe can’t eradicate these problems, either, but they are even more complicated in China,” said Professor Mao, who has studied food and pharmaceutical safety regulation. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Chinese food production has become larger scale and more technological, but the problems emerging also involve using more sophisticated technology to beat regulators and cheat consumers,” he said. “The government’s efforts need to catch up with the scale and complexity of the problems.” This time, at least, the government gave consumers a stomach-churning glimpse into problems in the meat industry. The cases described included a company in Inner Mongolia, a northeast region of China, caught with 23 tons of fake beef jerky and unprocessed frozen meat adulterated with flavoring chemicals and swarming with bacteria. Six suspects in Guizhou Province, in southwest China, were caught with 8.8 tons of “toxic chicken feet” marinated in a hydrogen peroxide solution and adulterated with illegal additives. Chicken feet, steamed or boiled with spices, are a popular dish in parts of China. The fraud sometimes had deadly results. In February, the police in Shaanxi Province in northwest China arrested a suspect accused of selling a lamb carcass so heavily laced with pesticide that one person died after eating the barbecued meat. In another show of official efforts to stem public ire over menaces to food safety, China’s Supreme People’s Court, the country’s highest court, on Friday issued guidelines for sternly punishing related offenses, like taking “ditch” cooking oil that has been used and dumped in drains and processing it to be resold for cooking. Such problems “seriously affect social harmony and stability, and seriously harm the image of the party and government,” the court said in a statement issued by state-run media. Public discontent about food safety has brought growing pressure on the Chinese Communist Party leadership, especially since 2008, when officials acknowledged that tens of thousands of children were at risk from kidney stones and other organ damage caused by milk powder adulterated with melamine, a chemical used to bamboozle protein tests. At least six infants died from illnesses attributed to the toxin, which sickened more than 300,000 children. Many consumers have recently stopped buying chicken and duck out of worries about avian flu. Parents in many Chinese cities, including Beijing, have become increasingly alarmed by acrid pollution that doctors blame for increased respiratory illnesses. “Food safety and environmental protection face the same problem that although regulatory capacity has expanded, there’s been no fundamental change for the better,” Professor Mao said. “The fact that the police have become involved shows how serious the problems still are.” ||||| BEIJING | BEIJING May 3 (Reuters) - Chinese police have broken a crime ring that passed off more than 1 million in rat and small mammal meat as mutton, authorities said, in a food safety crackdown that coincides with a bird flu outbreak and other environmental pressures. Authorities have arrested 904 suspects since the end of January for selling and producing fake or tainted meat products, the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement posted on its website on Thursday. During the crackdown, police discovered one suspect surnamed Wei who had used additives to spice up and sell rat, fox and mink meat at markets in Shanghai and Jiangsu province. Police arrested 63 suspects connected to the crime ring in a case valued at more than 10 million yuan (1.6 million) in sales since 2009. Despite persistent efforts by police, \\"food safety crimes are still prominent, and new situations are emerging with new characteristics\\", the ministry's statement said, citing \\"responsible officials\\". Police confiscated more than 20,000 tonnes of fake or inferior meat products after breaking up illegal food plants during the nationwide operation, the ministry said. Food safety and environmental pollution are chronic problems in China and public anxiety over cases of fake or toxic food often spreads quickly. In April, many consumers lost their appetite for poultry as an outbreak of the H7N9 bird flu virus spread in China. Sales dropped by 80 percent in eastern China, where the bird flu has been most prevalent, although experts stress that cooked chicken is perfectly safe. In March, more than 16,000 rotting pigs were found floating in one of Shanghai's main water sources, triggering a public outcry. Over-crowding at pig farms was likely behind the die-off and their disposal in the Huangpu river. The public security ministry said police had confiscated more than 15 tonnes of tainted pork in Anhui province, although as much as 60 tonnes had been sold in Anhui and Fujian provinces since mid-2012. But it was the rodent meat in particular that people couldn't stomach, with Internet users turning to the popular microblogging site Sina Weibo to vent their outrage. \\"Rats? How disgusting. Everything we eat is poison,\\" one user wrote.

Robert Adams’ Retrospective Goes West Retrospective exhibits, while an enviable chance to create a cohesive story from a lifetime’s worth of work, can be a curator’s nightmare: pieces have to be gathered from all over the world, selected at a distance, organized before they even get to the gallery. Not so the new retrospective of the work of Robert Adams, the photographer famous for documenting the people and landscapes of the American West—both natural and manmade—who is approaching his 75th birthday this May. The show, which opens at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) on March 11, was put together at the Yale University Art Gallery (YUAG) from the master set of thousands of prints donated to the gallery by the photographer in 2004. “We had time to work with originals and precisely strike a tone that we thought the overall exhibition should have,” says Joshua Chuang of the YUAG, who worked with Adams to curate the images that the show comprises. Adams had preserved the best prints of his work throughout his career and he was instrumental in sculpting the retrospective, which will travel for two years following its time at LACMA. “It’s a very special artist indeed who is the best editor of his own work,” says Chuang. “Adams is really exceptional in that way.” The resulting show is not intended to be merely a collection of over 300 pictures that happen to be the work of one artist, but rather a single, epic piece of work. It includes each of his major projects, dating back to 1964, and dozens of photo books that he has produced. LACMA’s installation also includes a multimedia reading room and a variety of related programs, from a botany-themed tour to talks with local artists who have been inspired by Adams’ work. Chuang says that, taken together, the pictures in the show demonstrate how, even though many people think that a camera captures a literal version of the world, the art of photography is one of fiction. “The way that fiction functions is very tricky because it’s using facts to tell a fiction, and it has the appearance of fact,” he says. Robert Adams’ particular devotion to those facts, especially when it comes to capturing the precise look of light that may be flat or boring or dim, was so extreme that the photographer, viewing prints of a photograph taken decades before, was able to describe to curators the exact feeling of standing in a particular spot thirty years ago, and how that feeling ought to come across in the image. Chuang says that such fastidiousness about light means that Robert Adams’ work probably captures the West more accurately than that of the other chronicler of that region, Ansel Adams. But that faithfulness doesn’t mean a lack of artistry. Robert Adams’ skill at capturing nondescript light conjures up an experience—whether it’s in a Target store or the desert—with unexpected intricacy. “He makes smog in California look ethereal and beautiful,” says Chuang. And because of his relationship with that state, the photographer’s series of Los Angeles photographs will be highlighted in the show’s LACMA incarnation, in order to allow visitors to compare the environment of their daily lives with the one captured on film, says Edward Robinson, LACMA curator. “It will be great for people to see this extraordinary photographer’s understanding and exploration of the area, to see how changes in the built environment have been reflected in the landscape,” says Robinson, “and what even the trees can suggest about the use of the land over time.” Robert Adams: The Place We Live will be on view at LACMA from March 11 through June 3.

Sentence 2: Courbet's paintings were heavily influenced by the landscape of the Loue river. Select from: a). yes. b). it is not possible to tell. c). no. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. In the first sentence, it is stated that the landscapes of the Loue river and its tributary, the Lison, 'inspired so many of Courbet's paintings.' This implies that Courbet's paintings were heavily influenced by the landscapes of these areas as the verb 'inspire' indicates that the landform became a significant creative source for Courbet's artistic creations. The term 'inspiration' in the artistic context can be interpreted as a kind of influence, which directly aligns with the claim made in the second sentence: \\"Courbet's paintings were heavily influenced by the landscape of the Loue River.\\" The first sentence gives a direct context where Courbet’s works were influenced by these landscapes as the artist traced the Loue river and its tributary, the Lison. The specifics of Courbet's influence are detailed further when you consider the idea of 'tracing' the river back to their sources. This action suggests that Courbet interacted with the landscape at an intimate and deep level, which would certainly have had a profound influence on his artwork. The phrase 'heavily influenced' used in the second sentence is an accurate summary of Courbet's high level of interaction and inspiration from the landscapes of the Loue river and the Lison, as described in the first sentence. In conclusion, the claim in sentence two is a simplification and summary of the information provided in sentence one. It encapsulates the influence of the Loue river’s landscape on Courbet's paintings as described in the first sentence.

Here is a news article: Steven Avery is the subject of the \\"Making a Murderer\\" documentary. (Photo: Photo courtesy of Netflix Inc.) Nearly three months after Steven Avery’s post-conviction lawyer pledged she had a plan to overturn her client’s 2007 murder conviction, both sides have signed a written agreement to begin independent scientific testing on several critical pieces of evidence. The agreement, several weeks in the making, was filed Wednesday with Sheboygan County Circuit Judge Angela Sutkiewicz, the special judge appointed to oversee Avery’s post-conviction appeal. Avery attorney Kathleen Zellner tweeted Wednesday afternoon that it had been signed. \\"It's encouraging that the Attorney General's Office was so cooperative and helpful in expediting these tests,\\" Zellner told USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin. \\"Our experience in our other exonerations is that's the best attitude in working toward trying to discover anything\\" that gets to the truth. Avery was convicted of intentional first-degree homicide by a jury of Manitowoc County residents in the death of Teresa Halbach, 25, of rural Calumet County. His case gained international attention when the \\"Making a Murderer\\" docu-series debuted on Netflix nearly a year ago. Practically all of the evidence included in the scientific testing order is connected to Halbach’s blue-green Toyota RAV4. The vehicle was located along the outer ridge of the Avery Salvage Yard on Nov. 5, 2005, six days after Halbach vanished. She was last seen alive on Halloween. She had visited the salvage yard to photograph a red van that Avery wanted to sell through the Auto Trader magazine. These critical items of evidence will undergo testing as part of this week’s court order: Blood flakes recovered from the floor near the center console of Halbach’s RAV4. Bloodstain cutting from the driver’s seat. Bloodstain cutting from passenger’s seat. Swab of the RAV 4 ignition area where blood was found. Swab of bloodstain taken from the rear passenger’s door. Swab of bloodstain taken from a CD case found in vehicle. Additionally, three other items of evidence used to secure Avery’s arrest and eventual conviction are subject to the new testing order. Those items are: A vial of blood said to be a sample of Avery’s blood from 1996. This was the vial of blood that Avery’s murder trial defense lawyers Dean Strang and Jerry Buting came across during their pretrial case research inside the clerk’s office at the Manitowoc County Courthouse. A spare key for Halbach’s vehicle found in Avery’s bedroom by Manitowoc County Sheriff’s deputies James Lenk and Andrew Colborn. The swab from the hood latch of Halbach’s RAV4 that later generated a DNA profile for Avery. Forensic testing on the hood latch was not performed by the Wisconsin State Crime Lab in Madison, even though the lab initially impounded the vehicle and conducted a battery of standard forensic tests. Rather, the swab of the hood latch that yielded the DNA profile of the murder defendant did not occur until six months later. In April 2006, Calumet County sheriff’s officials decided to carry out their own forensic testing of the hood area. Zellner has said she wants to determine if the hood latch DNA swab was fabricated from other known DNA samples that were in the possession of Calumet and Manitowoc County law enforcement.

'We could have separated them, but since they came as a kind of family, the zoo decided to keep them together,' said Diane Smith, assistant director of Noah's Ark. 'To our knowledge, this is the only place where you'll find this combination of animals together.' The only time they have ever been separated is when Baloo needed an operation to remove a harness that had been left around one of his paws. Noah's Ark Animal Sanctuary.

Hey there: Shere Khan approaches Baloo the bear to say hi in their enclosure. Best friends: Baloo and Shere Khan enjoy the closest relationship of the three. Best buds: Baloo and Shere Khan confirm their life-long friendship at their sanctuary. Playtime: The three animals relax during a day in the Georgia heat. Say cheese: Leo, Baloo and Shere Khan pose up for a family portrait in the morning sun. 'It is possible to see Baloo, who is a 1000lb bear, Shere Khan, a 350lb tiger and Leo, who is also 350lbs, messing around like brothers.

Handled by Charles and Jama Hedgecoth, the zoo's owners and founders, the three friendly giants appear to have have no comprehension of their animal differences. 'Baloo and Shere Khan are very close,' says Diane. 'That is because they rise early, and as Leo is a lion, he likes to spend most of the day sleeping. Predators: Leo and Shere Khan provide a very rare and unusual sight as the pose for a wonderful portrait. Youngsters: Thirteen years ago Baloo, Leo and Shere Khan were just cubs and did not know that nature never intended them to meet or be friends. Rough and tumble: Leo and Shere Khan practice their fighting skills - just for fun, mind. What is it? Shere Khan and Baloo look very confused by the blue ball in their pen, while Leo seems totally uninterested. 'It is wonderful and magical to see a giant American Black Bear put his arm around a Bengal and then to see the tiger nuzzle up to the bear like a domestic cat. 'When Leo wakes up the three of them mess around for most of the day before they settle down to some food.' Surprisingly for three apex predators with the power to kill with a single bite or swipe of their paw, they are very relaxed around each other. 'They eat, sleep and play together,' said Jama. 'As they treat each other as siblings they will lie on top of each other for heat and simply for affection. 'At the moment they are getting used to their new habitat. 'Shere Khan is being quite reticent about the move, but Baloo, the bear is very good at leading him on and making him feel comfortable and safe.'

Explaining that the three 'brothers' have always seemed to share a unique bond, Charles said: 'Noah's Ark is their home and they could not possibly be separated from each other. 'You just have to remember who you're dealing with when you are with them though. 'It's when you forget that these fellows are wild animals that you get yourself in trouble.'

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An abandoned ship crashes into a dockyard in Brooklyn, New York, and the ship inspector, Silas Green, finds it full of corpses. Elsewhere, Julius Jones, Silas's nephew, has a run-in with some Italian mobsters. Just as the two goons are about to kill Julius, Maximillian, a suave, mysterious vampire (who arrived on the ship in his intricately carved coffin), intervenes and kills them. Soon after, Maximillian infects Julius with his vampiric blood, before Julius turning into a decaying ghoul and claiming that it has benefits; he then explains that he has come to Brooklyn in search of the Dhampir daughter of a vampire from his native Caribbean island in order to live beyond the night of the next full moon. This Dhampir turns out to be NYPD Detective Rita Veder, who is still dealing with the death of her mentally ill mother (a paranormal researcher) some months before. As she and her partner, Detective Justice, are in the middle of investigating the murders on the ship, Rita begins having strange visions about a woman who looks like her, and begins asking questions about her mother's past. When she tells Justice about having \\"a strange feeling\\" about the investigation, he is skeptical, which frustrates Rita. The visions are presumably influenced in part by her vampire heritage; this is hinted at a few times throughout the first two-thirds of the story. Rita is completely unaware of this heritage, and believes she is losing her mind, similar to what happened to her mother. Meanwhile, Maximillian initiates a series of sinister methods to find out more about Rita and to further pull her into his thrall, including seducing and murdering her roommate Nikki, as well as disguising himself as her preacher and a lowlife crook. Max, in these disguises, misleads Rita into thinking Justice slept with Nikki,... Answer:","completion":"The ship inspector's name is Silas Green."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: 300: Battle of Artemisia Context: Note: this film is actually a prequel as well as a sequel to the original '300' film (with the events happening before, concurrently, and after the events of the previous film).In the opening scene, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) narrates about King Darius (Igal Naor) leading his army of Persians into Greece in the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC during the first Persian invasion of Greece. The Athenian general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) led his own army against them at the shores. The Greeks brutally and effortlessly take down the invading Persians one by one, paving the way for Themistocles to take aim at Darius, who is watching the massacre of his men from his ship offshore. Themistocles raises a bow and arrow, ready to commit the act that would make him known as a legend. He releases the bow just in time for Darius's son, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to watch. He runs to his father's side but is too late to save him as the arrow pierces him. Xerxes holds his father in his arms and locks eyes with Themistocles. The latter walks away, with Gorgo stating that he knew in his heart that he made a mistake not to kill Xerxes when he had the chance.Darius is returned to his kingdom to lie in his deathbed. He and Xerxes are joined by Artemisia (Eva Green), Darius's commanding naval officer, said to be as vicious as she is beautiful. She holds Darius's hand. In his dying moments, he tells Xerxes that it is best to leave the Greeks alone, for only the gods can defeat them. Artemisia pulls the arrow out of his chest to end his suffering. For a week, Xerxes sits and mourns the death of his father. On the eighth day, Artemisia holds Xerxes and tells him that his father's last words were not a warning, but a challenge. If only the gods can defeat the Greeks, then, she tells him, he is to become the god king.Artemisia has Xerxes sent into the desert wearing chains until he walks into a cave with a pool of bright gold liquid.

It made headlines on Thursday, when reports said that there's a chance it could strike our planet in less than 20 years. Such a collision could unleash a force as powerful as a couple of thousand atomic bombs. But NASA was quick to calm nerves and point out some very good news. The most dangerous known asteroids don't really pose much of a threat. And there are very few of them. Also, the chances that this one, which the Ukrainian astronomers who discovered it named 2013 TV135, will collide with Earth are extremely slim, NASA said in a statement it called \\"a reality check.\\" That's the size of four football fields, but it does not quite make it an OPTIONS: - Earth crusher. - NASA crusher. - TV135 crusher. - Ukrainian crusher.","completion":"an Earth crusher. The asteroid, named 2013 TV135 by the Ukrainian astronomers who discovered it, is approximately the size of four football fields. However, despite its considerable size, it does not classify as an Earth crusher. This term might suggest that the asteroid has the potential to cause catastrophic damage to our planet, but NASA's \\"reality check\\" statement has reassured the public that the threat posed by this particular asteroid is minimal. One reason for this comforting assessment is that 2013 TV135, as well as other known dangerous asteroids, simply don't pose much of a threat. While any asteroid collision with Earth can potentially cause significant damage, factors such as the size, composition, and trajectory of the asteroid are crucial elements that determine the extent of the impact. In the case of asteroid 2013 TV135, its relatively limited size compared to other Earth-approaching asteroids plays a significant role in diminishing the level of danger it presents. Another factor contributing to the reduced risk assessment is the extremely low likelihood of 2013 TV135 actually colliding with Earth. According to NASA's statement, the chances of this asteroid striking our planet in less than 20 years are very slim. With each passing year, astronomers are able to more accurately predict and track the paths of such potentially hazardous space objects, enabling better protection and preparation measures for our planet. That being said, it is essential that we continue to improve our understanding of these celestial bodies and monitor them closely, as they can still pose risks to our planet under certain circumstances. It is the ongoing collaboration between international space agencies, researchers, and astronomers that helps us in this regard, providing us with vital information and early warnings about potential threats and hazards from space. In conclusion, while the headline about the 2013 TV135 asteroid might seem alarming at first, NASA's \\"reality check\\" statement has effectively eased concerns by highlighting the minimal threat posed by this asteroid and others like it. Although it is the size of four football fields, it does not qualify as an Earth crusher. Instead, this situation serves as a reminder of the importance of constant advancements in space research and collaboration among the global scientific community, ensuring that we possess the knowledge and tools necessary to protect our planet from potential asteroid impacts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

House Ways and Means Republicans on Friday evening released an IRS video depicting agency employees line dancing to singer Cupid’s “down, down, do your dance.” The IRS shot the video for entertainment at a 2010 agency conference in Anaheim, Calif. Text Size - + reset The release of the video comes just days before the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration — the same watchdog that uncovered IRS employees were targeting conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status — is set to release a report that’s likely to bring a new wave of troubles for the IRS. (PHOTOS: 8 key players in IRS scandal story) The report is titled “Collected and Wasted: The IRS Spending Culture and Conference Abuses,” and part of it looks at the Anaheim conference. The probe shows the agency spent about 49 million on at least 220 conferences for employees over the past three years, according to a Washington Post report. House Republicans on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is slated to hold a hearing on IRS conference spending Thursday, will surely use the new video to blast the agency for wasting money. The video doesn’t lack for theatrics. Employees in the film are whipped into shape by a colleague yelling, “Get in line now. … Chop, chop!” “After countless hours of hard work and one broken leg,” the moderator says, the employees end up picking up on the shuffle and have fun. “They finally got it,” the woman who plays the trainer jokes. “They’re ready for Anaheim!” But Republicans don’t find it funny. “Whether it is the tens of thousands of hard-earned taxpayer dollars spent to produce frivolous entertainment for agency bureaucrats, or the IRS’s own admission that it targeted the American people based on their personal beliefs, the outrage toward the IRS is only growing stronger,” said Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Charles Boustany in a statement.

Movie plot title: The Mission Movie plot: The film is set in the 1750s and involves Spanish Jesuit priest Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) who enters the northeastern Argentina and western Paraguayan jungle to build a mission station and convert a GuaranÃ­ community to Christianity.[6] The GuaranÃ­ community is not initially receptive to Christianity or outsiders in general, shown by the opening scene where they tie a priest to a wooden cross and send him over the Iguazu Falls, a large waterfall they live above. Father Gabriel travels to the falls, climbs to the top, and plays his oboe. The GuaranÃ­ warriors, captivated by the music, allow him to live. Mercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) makes his living kidnapping natives such as the Guarani community and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza (Chuck Low). After returning from another kidnapping trip Mendoza is told by his assumed fiancÃ©, Carlotta (Cherie Lunghi), that she loves his younger half-brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn). Mendoza later finds them in bed together and in a fit of rage kills Felipe in a duel. Although he is acquitted of the killing by Cabeza, Mendoza spirals into depression and seeks absolution for his actions. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable penance. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return to the GuaranÃ­ village, scaling a cliff while dragging a heavy bundle containing his armour and sword. Upon reaching the outskirts of the natives' territory, there are a few tense moments when the natives recognise him, but after seeing him in his humbled state, they cut away his heavy bundle and forgive him. Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the GuaranÃ­. Moved by the GuaranÃ­'s acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit under Father Gabriel and his colleague Father Fielding (Liam Neeson). The Jesuit missions were safe because they were...

Question: For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3.

Article: WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States says an American citizen may have gone missing in Yemen. A State Department official says the U.S. is aware of reports of a missing American but can't discuss any individual's situation. The reports had indicated an oil worker was taken hostage in the capital of Sanaa, currently controlled by Shiite rebels known as Houthis (HOO'-theez). The State Department official says the U.S. urges all Americans living in Yemen to leave as soon as they safely can. The official wasn't authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity. The State Department says there's a high security threat to Americans because of terrorist activities and armed groups in Sanaa that have detained U.S. citizens before. A Saudi-led coalition has been fighting the Houthis in Yemen since March 2015. ||||| DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen’s Houthi forces have detained a U.S. citizen in the capital Sanaa for reasons that were not immediately clear, two colleagues of the man said on Monday. The Iran-aligned Houthis control much of northern Yemen, including Sanaa, and are battling a Saudi-led coalition that is trying to restore the internationally recognized government. Nadia Burch told Reuters that her husband, Danny Lavon Burch, was seized on Saturday after taking his children to school. He had been working in Yemen since the late 1980s, currently with the oil company Safer, said Burch, a Yemeni. “He has no problems or disputes with anyone, which is why he didn’t leave as others did,” she said. “I ask for the release of my husband and his safe return to me.” A U.S. State Department official said they were aware and concerned about the report. The Houthi movement did not respond to a request for comment and the Safer oil company was also not immediately available for comment. Two of Mr. Burch’s colleagues in Sanaa said Houthi forces were responsible, without elaborating. But Nadia Burch said the kidnappers had not contacted her and she was unsure of their identity. More than 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen’s civil war. It began in March 2015 when the Houthis advanced on the interim headquarters of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in the southern port city of Aden, forcing him to flee the country and seek Saudi help. |||||Summary:","completion":"An American citizen, identified as Danny Lavon Burch, may have gone missing in Yemen, according to a U.S. State Department official.

Q: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Pakistan tried to control the foreign exchange market and India didn't.

The Pitchford Inquiry is to look at how undercover officers infiltrated political campaigns over 40 years. It has been claimed that some of the officers spied on activists ahead of the G8 summit at Gleneagles in 2005. But the inquiry is only currently able to examine undercover operations in England and Wales. Its remit states that the inquiry can \\"report on undercover police operations conducted by English and Welsh police forces in England and Wales since 1968\\". But it \\"will not examine undercover or covert operations conducted by any body other than an English or Welsh police force\\". Scotland's justice secretary Michael Matheson has now written to the Home Office asking that the inquiry be extended so that it covers the activities of undercover officers in Scotland as well as England and Wales. However, the justice secretary said he had not received any \\"concrete evidence\\" that officers working for Scottish police forces had broken guidelines on the use of covert surveillance. Undercover: The allegations made to date He added: \\"I have written to the Home Secretary asking her to confirm that Lord Justice Pitchford's inquiry will be able to take evidence relating to undercover operations in Scotland authorised by and carried out by English and Welsh police forces as part of a national operation.\\" The move was welcomed by Scottish Labour MSP Neil Findlay, who has been among those calling for an inquiry into covert police operations in Scotland. Mr Findlay said it was a \\"breakthrough in the campaign for an inquiry into undercover police spying on environmental, trade union and political activists\\". The Home Office confirmed that the home secretary had received the letter and would respond in due course. Last month, the Metropolitan Police made an \\"unreserved apology\\" and agreed financial compensation packages for seven women deceived into having sexual relationships with undercover officers who were spying on campaign groups. One of the five officers involved fathered children. The officers had been working undercover for the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), which was part of the Metropolitan Police until it was shut down in 2008, and the separate National Public Order Intelligence Unit (NPOIU). Both teams deployed officers on long-term undercover operations to infiltrate radical political or social causes, such as environmental campaigns, anarchy and animal rights. It has been claimed that undercover Met officers including Mark Kennedy, one of the five officers who is known to have had relationships with women, infiltrated environmental groups ahead of the Gleneagles G8 summit.

The shiny brass gleamed under the warm sunlight streaming through the window, reflecting a golden brilliance that couldn't be achieved by any polishing of his aged instrument. However, it wasn't just the upgraded appearance; this new trumpet was longer than his old one, and that's the reason it wouldn't fit into the worn-out case he's been using for years. Vincent, an aspiring and talented musician, had been waiting to upgrade his trumpet for some time. He had dreams of playing with big bands and world-class orchestras, but he knew that the smaller size of his old trumpet limited his range and performance possibilities. When he finally saved enough money, he took a chance on ordering a professional-grade trumpet, not realizing that the longer trumpet design may not fit his case. Now that his new and improved trumpet had arrived, Vincent found himself unable to use his old case. He tried every angle and position, but it was evident that the extra length of the trumpet would not allow it to fit. Feeling anxious and frustrated, he began to search for a solution. He knew that merely carrying the trumpet without a case could result in serious damage to the delicate instrument. Vincent decided to start looking for a new case specifically designed to accommodate longer trumpets, much like his own. He embarked on a journey to find the perfect case for his treasured trumpet going from store to store, browsing through countless models and shapes. It wasn't a simple search. The new trumpet possessed unique dimensions, and Vincent wanted a case that would provide a snug fit while offering optimal protection. He pondered custom-made options and local artisans who could potentially build a unique case or modify an existing one. As he continued his quest, Vincent stumbled upon countless musicians and discovered new styles and techniques, each giving a unique perspective to his beloved art. A few weeks into his search, Vincent finally discovered a beautifully crafted leather case, offering elegance and durability. The customized case allowed for his trumpet's unique length and design, without compromising its snug fit. His perseverance had paid off, and he knew that his trumpet was finally secure and safe. With the problem solved, Vincent returned to practicing and refining his skills, introducing new techniques he had learned during his search. The longer, more advanced trumpet allowed him to access new depths of his musical aptitude, creating richer, more intricate tones. Soon enough, word got around about the rising trumpet virtuoso, and invitations to join prestigious ensembles and perform at exclusive events were sent his way. Vincent's journey to replace his old case became much more than he had initially imagined. His dedication to safekeeping his new trumpet indirectly led to his growth as a musician and the admiration of his peers. Not only did he find the perfect case worthy of safeguarding his treasured instrument, but he also advanced in his skills, transforming his life as a musician profoundly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What does the woman mean? - She doesn't expect to finish all her work in thirty minutes. - She has to do a lot of things within a short time. - She has been overworking for a long time.","completion":"The woman, Mary, means that she has to do a lot of things within a short time. This can be deduced from the dialogue that unfolds between the two individuals. Mary appears overwhelmed and admits that she has a million things to do, which implies that she has numerous tasks or responsibilities to handle. In addition, she further states that she needs to finish these tasks within the next 30 minutes. This clearly communicates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the short amount of time she has to complete these tasks. The statement \\"She doesn't expect to finish all her work in thirty minutes\\" is not entirely accurate, as Mary only expresses the overwhelming nature of her situation and has not explicitly stated that she does not expect to finish her work in the given time frame. However, given the enormity and urgency of her tasks, it is understandable why it could be inferred that she might not have the confidence to complete everything promptly. Lastly, the statement \\"She has been overworking for a long time\\" cannot be directly inferred from the dialogue. While Mary is evidently under pressure due to her numerous tasks and the time constraint, there is no indication that this has been a prolonged situation for her or that she has been working in this state for an extended period. In conclusion, the most accurate interpretation of the woman's meaning within the context of the dialogue is that she has to do a lot of things within a short period of time, which leads to her feeling overwhelmed and possibly doubtful of her ability to complete all her work within the next 30 minutes. However, her statement does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that she has been overworked for an extended period of time or that she necessarily expects to not complete her work in the allotted time frame."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who treated the band well on the tour? Metallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album. Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname \\"Alcoholica\\". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading \\"Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All\\". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. \\"In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we've won them over. And fans who come to hear Ozzy go home liking Metallica.\\" Metallica won over Osbourne's fans and slowly began to establish a mainstream following.The tour, however, was notable for several incidents. Hetfield broke his wrist in a mid-tour skateboarding accident, and his guitar technician John Marshall played rhythm guitar on several dates. The European leg of the Damage, Inc. Tour commenced in September, with Anthrax as the supporting band. After the performance of September 26 in Stockholm, the band's bus rolled over on a stretch of icy road the following morning. Burton was thrown through a window and killed instantly. The driver was charged with manslaughter but was not convicted. The band returned to San Francisco and hired Flotsam and Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted to replace Burton. Many of the songs that appeared on the band's next album, ...And Justice for All, were composed during Burton's career with the band.

Let's go step by step: Step 1: Combine the terms with r. 575r and 861r are like terms, which means that they both contain the variable r raised to the same power (in this case, the power is 1). We can add them together: (575 + 861)r = 1436r So, our equation now looks like this: 1436r + 2202 = 12254 Step 2: Isolate the term with r. We want to get r by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to subtract 2202 from both sides of the equation: 1436r + 2202 - 2202 = 12254 - 2202 1436r = 10052 Step 3: Solve for r. Now that we have isolated the r term, we can solve for r by dividing both sides of the equation by 1436: 1436r / 1436 = 10052 / 1436 r ≈ 6.9958 So, the solution to the equation is: r ≈ 6.9958"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Population: - The Battle of Kursk was a Second World War engagement between German and Soviet forces on the Eastern Front near Kursk (south-west of Moscow) in the Soviet Union during July and August 1943. The German offensive was code-named Operation Citadel and led to one of the largest armoured clashes in history, the Battle of Prokhorovka. The German offensive was countered by two Soviet counter-offensives, Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev and Operation Kutuzov. For the Germans, the battle was the final strategic offensive that they were able to launch on the Eastern Front. Their extensive loss of men and tanks ensured that the victorious Soviet Red Army enjoyed the strategic initiative for the remainder of the war. - Operation Kutuzov was a major offensive launched by the Red Army on 12 July 1943, in the Central Russian Upland, against Army Group Center of the German \\"Wehrmacht\\". The operation was named after General Mikhail Kutuzov, the Russian general credited with saving Russia from Napoleon during the French invasion of Russia in 1812.

Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream.

Answer the question...what is the height of the freedom tower??","completion":"The Freedom Tower, officially known as One World Trade Center, is the main building of the redeveloped World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, New York City. It is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere and was completed in 2014. The height of One World Trade Center is notably symbolic: its structural height (roof height) is 1,368 feet (417 meters) which is the exact same height as the North Tower of the original World Trade Center. However, the building's total height, including its antenna, reaches a significant 1,776 feet (541 meters). This particular height of 1,776 feet was purposefully chosen as a direct reference to the year of the United States' Declaration of Independence. Including its antenna, One World Trade Center is currently the sixth tallest building in the world. Without the antenna, it ranks as the 28th tallest. Despite these categorizations, the building's symbolic height of 1776 feet has also made it a powerful and dramatic symbol of resilience and renewal in the face of the devastating terrorist attacks that destroyed the original World Trade Center buildings on September 11, 2001. One World Trade Center's 104 floors comprise commercial office space, an observation deck, several restaurants, and broadcasting infrastructure, with the antenna functioning as a critical part of broadcast operations for the area. In short, while the structural top of One World Trade Center stands at 1,368 feet or 417 meters, its overall height including its antenna brings it to a symbolic and monumental 1,776 feet, or 541 meters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These protesters wanted to go to a place called Pennsylvania to do something called picketing. Picketing is when people stand outside with signs to show they don't like something. But, they wanted to picket at a very sad event called a funeral. Funerals are when people say goodbye to someone they love who has passed away. The funerals were for a group of people called the Amish. The Amish are very kind people who live a simple life, without many of the things we use every day, like cars and electricity. They wear simple clothes and work very hard on their farms. It is very important to be respectful at a funeral because people are feeling very sad. When the protesters realized this, they decided it would be wrong to picket at the Amish funerals. So, they changed their plans and decided not to go. In the end, the Amish families could say goodbye to their loved ones in peace. The protesters learned that it is important to be kind and respectful, even if they don't agree with someone else's way of living.

Which American group is made up of will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo and Fergie?","completion":"The American group you are referring to is The Black Eyed Peas, a hip-hop and pop music band that originated in Los Angeles, California. The group was formed in 1995 and initially consisted of members will.i.am (William James Adams Jr.), apl.de.ap (Allan Pineda Lindo), and Taboo (Jaime Luis Gomez). The trio gained popularity in hip-hop circles and released their debut album, “Behind the Front,” in 1998. The album received critical acclaim and helped establish The Black Eyed Peas as a creative force within the music industry. Fergie (Stacy Ann Ferguson) joined the group in 2002, adding a distinctive female vocal presence and later becoming an essential component of the band's mainstream success. Fergie, who had initially gained fame as a member of the all-female pop group Wild Orchid, brought a different musical style and vibe to The Black Eyed Peas. This new sound was showcased in their third album, “Elephunk,” which was released in 2003. The album featured the hit singles \\"Where is the Love?\\" (featuring Justin Timberlake), \\"Hey Mama,\\" and \\"Let's Get It Started,\\" propelling the band to international stardom. The Black Eyed Peas continued their successful run with albums such as “Monkey Business” (2005), which included popular tracks like \\"Don't Phunk with My Heart,\\" \\"My Humps,\\" and \\"Pump It.\\" Their fifth album, “The E.N.D.” (2009), featured the record-breaking single \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" and the dance sensation \\"I Gotta Feeling.\\" This album showcased the band's evolution towards electronic dance music, solidifying their influence on global pop culture. In 2011, the group released their sixth album, “The Beginning,” which included the hit tracks \\"The Time (Dirty Bit)\\" and \\"Just Can't Get Enough.\\" Despite the continued commercial success, Fergie decided to take a hiatus from the group in 2017 to focus on her solo career, family life, and other interests. This led to The Black Eyed Peas briefly returning to their roots as a trio. However, in 2020, they released a new album called \\"Translation,\\" which included collaborations with artists such as Shakira, Maluma, and J Balvin. Throughout their career, The Black Eyed Peas have not only exhibited a unique capacity to experiment with different sounds and genres but also to address social issues and promote a message of unity. The group's members have also been involved in a variety of individual projects, from solo music careers to acting and philanthropy work. Their musical legacy continues to thrive, and they remain influential figures in the global music scene."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Most manufacturers place them near the car’s engine or battery, beneath the steering wheel, or inside the glove box. Look for a gray or black box; it may be labeled as “Fuses.” Check your car’s manual if you have trouble finding the fuse boxes. If you don’t have your manual, search online for “fuse box placement” plus your car’s year, make, and model. Lift the latch on the side of the fuse box to loosen the cover. Check the inside of the lid for a diagram of the devices each fuse controls. Your manual may also include a diagram but, if all else fails, you can also find information on your specific vehicle online. The diagram will also list the fuse’s amperage, which you’ll need to know to purchase a replacement. Be sure to turn your car off before troubleshooting the fuse box. Some cars and fuse replacement kits include small plastic fuse pullers, which you can use to pluck the fuse from the box. If you don’t have fuse pullers handy, a pair of tweezers will do the trick. In a pinch, you can also carefully pull the fuse from the box with your fingers. Make sure your car is completely off before you pull out the blown fuse. Keep the keys out of the ignition to avoid accidentally putting it in “Run” or “Accessories” mode. Otherwise, you could get a nasty shock. Car fuses are small, so it’s a little tougher to find signs that one blew. Hold it up to the light and look closely inside for a thin wire that connects the 2 sides of the fuse. If the wire is broken, or if you see charred marks, the fuse has blown. If the wire is intact and the fuse seems fine, double-check your diagram to ensure you have the correct fuse. If you've checked each fuse individually and none have blown, your car’s electrical system may need a mechanic’s attention. If you’re not able to visually tell if the fuse has blown, then you may need to check the fuses with a multimeter to determine if it’s working. Head to an auto shop or major retailer's automotive department to find fuses for your car. Bring the blown fuse with you to ensure you get the right match. Once you’ve purchased the right replacement, simply insert it into the slot where you removed the blown fuse. Make sure the car is off before you set the fuse into the empty slot. Press down with a little pressure until it pops into place. Car fuses are color-coded, so if the fuses are a different color, you know right away they aren’t a match. Additionally, be sure the prong shape of the new fuse matches the old one. If necessary, ask an employee at the store for help finding the right replacement.","completion":"This article discusses the process of finding, checking, and replacing a car's fuse.

The three-time Ballon d'Or winner had failed to score in his past three games for Real Madrid and was under scrutiny from some sections of the Spanish press ahead of Los Blancos' round of 16 Champions League tie with Schalke. But in the 26th minute, Ronaldo proved his doubters wrong, thumping a powerful header past third-choice keeper Timon Wellenreuther from Daniel Carvajal's cross to give Real a 1-0 lead. Cristiano Ronaldo has ended his three-game goal drought against Schalke in the Champions League. Ronaldo scored with a powerful header from Daniel Carvajal's cross to give his side the lead. It was refreshing to see that the media's cynicism had not spilled over into Real's fanbase and several supporters brought banners of well-wishes for Ronaldo. To the casual observer, three games without a goal might not seem that big a deal, especially considering that Ronaldo had already netted 36 times beforehand. But the mini-drought came as a sub-plot to a wider concern about the player's form or rather his attitude. Ronaldo was recently criticised for going ahead with his birthday celebrations in a nightclub just hours after Real had lost 4-0 to city rivals Atletico in the Madrid derby. The goal against Schalke, incidentally, was Ronaldo's 464th for club and country since starting his career in 2002. One Real Madrid fan reveals her unwavering support for Cristiano Ronaldo.

On 27 July 1843 Sharpe married Elizabeth Fletcher, second sister of John Fletcher, at Bolton Parish Church. The couple had five children: Francis in 1845, Edmund junior (known as Ted) in 1847, Emily in 1849, Catherine (known as Kate) in 1850, and Alfred in 1853.When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47. The seven years he spent there were later described, in a Memoir published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as \\"perhaps the happiest years of his life\\". The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called Bron Haul near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the A5 road. Two years later he bought a larger property called Coed-y-Celyn on the east bank of the River Lledr, about a mile south of Betws-y-Coed.

Answer the following question: Two students were learning about atmospheres and planets. Dan learned about the atmosphere of Earth, while Nate learned about planet Venus and its atmosphere. Which student learned less about the planet with a hotter surface temperature? Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","completion":"Since Dan learned about the atmosphere of Earth, and Nate learned about planet Venus and its atmosphere, and Venus has a much hotter surface temperature than Earth, the student who learned less about the planet with a hotter surface temperature would be Dan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification.

Is \\"The age limit of eighty years imposed by the Pope, a numerical increase of Cardinals by almost 100%, and a reform of the regal vestments of the \\"Princes of the Church\\" further contributed to a service-oriented perception of Cardinals under his pontificate.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What type of clothing did Paul VI enact reform on?\\"","completion":"While the statement provides some useful information, it does not effectively answer the question \\"What type of clothing did Paul VI enact reform on?\\" The statement primarily focuses on the age limit, increase in the number of cardinals, and the general perception of cardinals under Paul VI's pontificate. However, it does not delve into the specific details of the clothing reforms enacted by Paul VI. A better and more detailed answer to the question would be: Pope Paul VI enacted reform on the traditional regalia worn by the cardinals, who were known as the \\"Princes of the Church.\\" His clothing reform aimed to simplify and modernize the vestments, moving towards a more service-oriented perception and function of the Cardinals. One of the major changes implemented by Paul VI was the elimination of the cappa magna, a long, cape-like garment with an extensive train that historically symbolized the rank and power of a cardinal. The cappa magna was associated with great pomp and splendor. Instead, cardinals were instructed to wear a simple scarlet cape trimmed with ermine, a more modest and less ostentatious garment. Other modifications in the regalia of cardinals included the simplification of the consistory choir dress. Previously, this attire comprised of an elaborate fur-trimmed gown with a fur-trimmed cowl, which was replaced by a plain choir cassock without the fur. The fur-trimmed mozzetta, a short, cape-like garment, was also replaced with a plain version. Additionally, the zuchetto, a skullcap worn by the cardinals, was changed from red to scarlet. These reforms sought to emphasize the spiritual and pastoral role of the cardinals as opposed to the lavish insignia of their status as \\"Princes of the Church.\\" Under Pope Paul VI, the focus shifted to their service to the Church, highlighting the theological significance, simplicity, and humility expected of their position. In conclusion, Pope Paul VI reformed the traditional regalia worn by cardinals by simplifying and modernizing the vestments. The changes removed symbols of power and rank associated with these ecclesiastical garments, placing greater emphasis on the spiritual and pastoral role of cardinals in the Church."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Combine like terms: 847d, 880d, and 708d are the like terms. And -379d is subtracted. 847d + 880d + 708d - 379d = 2056d So, the simplified equation will become: 2056d = -117192 This simplified equation can be solved for d by dividing the two sides of the equation with the coefficient of d (2056). So divide each side of the equation by 2056, such that d = -117192 / 2056 By performing this division, we can find the value of 'd' d = -57 Therefore, the solution to the equation 847*d + 880*d + 708*d - 379*d = -117192 is d = -57."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When she becomes aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread.Guerin begins by interviewing the prepubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing projects. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved.As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her being removed from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation.On June 26, 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous citations for speeding she has ignored.

Q:Information: - Ciconia is a genus of birds in the stork family . Six of the seven living species occur in the Old World , but the maguari stork has a South American range . In addition , fossils suggest that Ciconia storks were somewhat more common in the tropical Americas in prehistoric times . These are large storks , typically 100 cm tall , with a 180 cm wingspan and a long thick bill . Members of this genus are more variable in plumage than other storks , but several species have black upper bodies and wings , and white belly and undertail . Juveniles are a duller , browner version of the adult . Ciconia storks are gregarious and colonial breeders , and pairs stay together for life . They typically build large stick nests in trees , although the maguari stork will nest on the ground and at least three species will construct their nests on human habitations . One of these , the white stork , is probably the best known of all storks , with a wealth of legend and folklore associated with this familiar visitor to Europe . These storks feed on frogs , insects , young birds , lizards and rodents . They fly with the neck outstretched , like most other storks , but unlike herons which retract their neck in flight . The migratory species like the white stork and the black stork soar on broad wings and rely on thermals of hot air for sustained long distance flight . Since thermals only form over land , these storks , like large raptors , must cross the Mediterranean at the narrowest points , and many of these birds can be seen going through the Straits of Gibraltar and the Bosphorus on migration . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills. They belong to the family Ciconiidae. They are the only family in the order Ciconiiformes, which was once much larger and held a number of families. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how much does U.S. pay on health care per person Suggested answer: The two countries had similar health care systems before Canada reformed its system in the 1960s and 1970s. Should I validate this answer?","completion":"It appears that the suggested answer does not directly address the question being asked. The question is asking for the amount that the U.S. spends on health care per person, but the provided answer is comparing the health care systems of the U.S. and Canada. To provide a detailed and accurate answer to the question, one should consider the following information: According to the latest data available from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in 2019, the U.S. spent a total of around 3.8 trillion on health care, which equates to approximately 11,582 per person. It's important to note that health care spending per capita can vary year by year and is influenced by numerous factors, such as changes in health care costs, policy updates, and population growth. The U.S. is known for having one of the highest health care expenditures per capita among developed countries. This level of spending is generally attributed to a combination of factors, which may include a higher prevalence of chronic diseases, higher prices of medical goods and services, and a more fragmented health care delivery system. If you want to compare the U.S. health care spending per person to that of Canada, in 2019, Canada spent approximately CAD 264 billion on health care, which equates to roughly CAD 7,068 (USD 5,418) per person, as per the Canadian Institute for Health Information. Comparing these figures, it indicates that the U.S. pays a significantly higher amount per person on health care than Canada does. In conclusion, the original suggested answer should not be validated, and a more appropriate answer would be: In 2019, the U.S. spent approximately 11,582 on health care per person. This figure is higher than many other developed countries, including Canada, which spent around USD 5,418 per person on health care in the same year."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question The Tepehuán suffered a series of devastating epidemics of European-introduced diseases in the years before the revolt. Epidemics were known to have occurred in their region in 1594, 1601-1602, 1606-1607, 1610, and 1616-1617. The Tepehuán and their neighbors may have been reduced in population by more than 80 percent by the epidemics, from a pre-Columbian population of more than 100,000 to fewer than 20,000, of which the Tepehuán may have been one-half of this total During the Chichimeca war the Tepehuán remained neutral although urged by the Chichimecas to join them in resistance to Spanish expansion. The Spanish failed to defeat the Chichimeca militarily and instituted a new policy called \\"peace by purchase\\" in which Catholic missionaries would be a major tool in pacifying hostile and semi-hostile Indians. Indians were to be supplied with food and tools and resettled into towns. Missionaries, rather than the military, would take on most of the responsibility for integrating the Indians into Mexican and Christian society. The Acaxee and Xixime were the first to have this new Spanish policy applied to them and the Tepehuán would be next. How many people dies in the epidemics?","completion":"The exact number of people who died in the epidemics is not provided in the article. However, it states that the Tepehuán and their neighbors' population might have been reduced by more than 80% due to the epidemics. The pre-Columbian population was more than 100,000, which means that if the reduction was indeed 80%, then approximately 80,000 people (80% of 100,000) would have died in the epidemics, leaving fewer than 20,000 people. It is important to note that this is an estimation and the actual number of deaths could be higher or lower."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Media playback is not supported on this device On the same Centre Court where he ended Great Britain's 77-year wait for a men's singles champion last year, Murray gave a listless display in the quarter-finals as he was thrashed 6-1 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 by rising star Grigor Dimitrov. In four Grand Slams since his Wimbledon triumph, Murray, 27, has not reached a final and has only got past the quarter-finals on one occasion, although he spent a large chunk of the last 12 months recovering from back surgery. Although critical of Murray's \\"flat\\" body language during the match, Connors backed the Briton to return to the top, even though the would number five will slip further down the world rankings as a result of his defeat at SW19. \\"Murray has got years of great tennis left,\\" Connors, who won his last Grand Slam in 1983 at the age of 31, told BBC Sport. \\"Winning Grand Slams is different to other tournaments. It's two weeks, with days off, fighting mental battles, fighting physical battles, winning three out of five sets, everything. That's why they are so tough.\\" Fellow American John McEnroe felt Murray was just beaten by the \\"hungrier guy\\" but wondered if the Scot, who asked Amelie Mauresmo to be his coach following the French Open, might decide to give his former adviser, Ivan Lendl, a call. \\"I think it would still be possible and possibly profitable for both of them,\\" said McEnroe, who won seven Grand Slams in his career. \\"Having said that, I would give Amelie more of a chance.\\" John Lloyd said he was \\"baffled\\" by Murray's performance, while Tim Henman, another former British number one, said Dimitrov was a \\"star who will be around for a very long time\\". Read more from Connors, McEnroe, Lloyd and Henman below, plus reaction from the BBC's other top tennis pundits. \\"Andy looked a bit flat out there. Once the shoulders shrug and the head falls, that just gives your opponent that little extra lift. Media playback is not supported on this device \\"Sometimes it is how you lose that counts. If you go out there and get hammered but fought to the very end and came out bloody, then you walk off with your head held high. \\"It's easy to say from here but when things are not working you should try to do something else. You have to mix some things up. When you are down two sets to love, you've still got to try to figure out a way to win. \\"I noticed Murray looking up to his box a lot. Your coach can't help you. You are down there by yourself. \\"That's why tennis is so great. It's you against someone who is trying to beat your brains out. That's the fun part of it, to figure out a way to keep that from happening. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\\" \\"I found it interesting that Dimitrov said Murray was looking tired or flat in the warm-up. It's a classic case of a hungrier guy that wanted it more against a guy who just woke up on the wrong side of the bed, didn't seem to have the energy, Media playback is not supported on this device \\"Dimitrov was totally comfortable from the baseline, which I found amazing. One shot that made all the difference in the world to me - which is unusual in men's tennis now - was the one-handed sliced backhand. It really bothered Murray. \\"I've never seen Andy Murray miss more easy balls. Again, how much did it have to do with him having a terrible day and how much did it have to do with Dimitrov? \\"I think Mauresmo's done an excellent job coaching other people. There's no reason to suggest she can't do a good job coaching Murray. It would be unfair to her to fire her, because there's nothing you can do right before Wimbledon, when you're trying to defend your title. \\"Could I suggest the possible call to Lendl? I wouldn't put it past the two of them. I think it would still be possible and possibly profitable for both of them. Having said that, I would give Amelie more of a chance.\\" \\"In his first four matches, Andy's serve was first class, but today he struggled. His first-serve percentage wasn't bad - 61% - but he only won three out of 10 points on his second serve. \\"There are two sides to this... Dimitrov came out and controlled it from the word go, winning the first set in 25 minutes. The second-set tie-break was crucial and, at 4-4, he played three great points in a row. \\"On the other hand, Andy didn't play at his best. There's not too much to analyse. He didn't play well and his opponent took full advantage.\\" \\"There is a whole load of weight on you as defending champion and I thought Andy did really well in the opening games. \\"When I was here defending my title, I just felt so much pressure and I felt like a huge disappointment to me and everyone else when I lost. I was just glad to get that year out of the way. \\"Andy did try today, but it just didn't work for him.\\" \\"We are baffled by the performance of Andy Murray. You can have bad days but it's strange that his intensity was not higher. At least make your opponent work and put him under pressure but that didn't happen. \\"Andy Murray was poor, his body language was poor and he gave up this game too easy. For a player of his standard, who has won two Grand Slams, I am very, very surprised by the way he has gone out.\\" \\"Murray has always had that ability that all great champions have to figure it out and get in their opponent's head. But today, every time I thought it was his moment, he delivered the unforced error. \\"Dimitrov's movement at the back of the court was exceptional. Andy said at the French Open that he thought defence was the most important part of the sport and I think he was a bit put off by how well Dimitrov was able to deal with the shots he threw at him.\\" Nine-time champion Martina Navratilova: \\"Wow, what an amazing match Dimitrov played today.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Italy are the only World Cup squad without any English-based players. England's first opponents in Brazil have begun their training camp. Mario Balotelli, Andrea Pirlo and Gianluigi Buffon in action.","completion":"Title: Italy, a World Cup Squad without English-based Players, Begins Training for Brazil Showdown The Italian national team has begun preparations for the upcoming World Cup, with a unique characteristic setting them apart from every other participating country: they have no English-based players in their squad. As Italy faces off against England in their first match in Brazil, this interesting factor will certainly add an intriguing dimension to the match. In a football world where English clubs have consistently drawn superstar talent from around the globe, Italy is bucking the trend with a team composed entirely of players without England's Premier League experience. Instead, their roster is primarily made up of players from their domestic Serie A as well as a few from other European leagues. The Italian team has assembled some of the finest talents in world football, including star players Mario Balotelli, Andrea Pirlo, and Gianluigi Buffon, as they commence their training camp in anticipation of the Brazil tournament. Eyes are on Mario Balotelli, a dynamic and unpredictable striker, as he returns to the national team with a wealth of experience from both the Serie A and France's Ligue 1. Supporting Balotelli will be the highly-skilled and experienced midfielder Andrea Pirlo, known for his playmaking ability and free-kick prowess. Back in goal, captain and goalkeeping legend Gianluigi Buffon provides a towering figure of leadership and reliability, as he seeks to make an impact in what could be his final World Cup appearance. With a string of strong performances in their recent qualifying campaign, the Italian team presents itself as a formidable challenge for their opponents in Brazil. Their decision to focus entirely on domestic and European talent, rather than counting on English-based players, displays a strong sense of identity and belief in their own capacity. As the Azzurri march towards the Brazil-hosted World Cup, their aggregate of diverse talent combines to form a cohesive unit, demonstrating the strength of football in a nation with a rich history of success. This training camp is a unique opportunity not just for the players to hone their skills and build their teamwork but also for the team as a whole to showcase the richness of Italian football, both in terms of individual skill and as a thriving football culture that looks confidently towards the future. In conclusion, Italy's decision to enter the World Cup without any English-based players in their squad represents a bold and unique position in international football. While their upcoming match against England may shine the spotlight on this divergence between the two national teams, it is Italy's impressive combination of talented players from their domestic leagues and other European competitions that defines their potential for success in Brazil. The world will be watching as these Italian superstars bring their skills, experience, and teamwork to bear on football's biggest stage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who decides to give a warning to a Hollywood actress? Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse. Having now observed Honey's many qualities beyond his minor eccentricities, and after becoming very close to Elspeth, she decides to make the arrangement permanent by marrying the engineer. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Theodore Honey decides to give a warning to Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale.

This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. What is probably true about the relationship between US and Canada after Trump met with Canada's leader? - it gets really bad - it remains good - it dwindles - not enough information A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it appears that the relationship between the US and Canada remains good after Trump met with Canada's leader, as Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
