Plot title: The Last Valley Movie plot: \\"The Captain\\" (Michael Caine) leads a band of mercenaries who fight for the highest bidder regardless of religion. His soldiers pillage the countryside, and rape and loot when not fighting. Vogel (Omar Sharif) is a former teacher trying to survive the slaughter of civilians occurring throughout south-central Germany. Vogel runs from the Captain's forces, but eventually stumbles upon an idyllic mountain vale, untouched by war and still living in the age before the war. The Captain and his small band are not far behind. Trapped in the valley, Vogel convinces the Captain to preserve it and the village it shelters for their own benefit, as the outside world faces famine and devastation. \\"Live\\", Vogel tells the Captain, \\"while the army dies.\\" The Captain decides that his men will indeed rest here for the winter. He forces the locals to submit, especially their Headman, Gruber (Nigel Davenport). The local Catholic priest (Per Oscarsson) is livid that the mercenaries include a number of Protestants (and nihilistic atheists for that matter), but there is little he can do to sway the Captain. The mercenaries are of one mind after the Captain kills a dissenting member of his band, and religious and ethnic divisions are set aside. At first, the locals accept their fate. Vogel is appointed judge by Gruber, to settle disputes between villagers and soldiers. As long as food, shelter, and a small number of women are provided, the mercenaries leave the locals alone. Hansen (Michael Gothard) attempts to rape a girl and, exiled from the group, manages to lead a rival mercenary band to the valley, before the winter sets in and closes the valley to all outsiders. He and his band are destroyed and the valley goes into hibernation. But as winter fades, it becomes obvious that the soldiers will have to leave. The Captain learns of a major military campaign in the Upper Rhineland and decides to leave the valley in order to participate. Vogel wants to accompany him, fearing Gruber will have him killed once The Captain leaves.... My question: What did the captain decide?

The band's lineup consisted of guitarist John Spinks, vocalist and bassist Tony Lewis, and drummer Alan Jackman. They had an unusual experience for a British band in that they enjoyed commercial success in the US, but never in their homeland. 1987 saw the release of their second album, Bangin'. This album did not achieve the acclaim of Play Deep, but it did spawn a Top 40 single \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" (not to be confused with the 1970s Rainbow and Head East hit of the same name) and the minor radio/MTV hit \\"No Surrender\\", and the album was certified Gold in the US A US summer tour opening for Night Ranger followed. For the group's third album, 1989's Voices of Babylon, a new producer (David Kahne) and sound was evident. The title track was a Top 25 single and \\"My Paradise\\" was a mid-sized album-rock hit, but overall the group's popularity continued to decline. After the Babylon LP, Alan Jackman parted ways with the band and was replaced for a concert tour by Paul Read. Spinks and Lewis continued as a duo, switched labels and began recording Diamond Days for MCA. Playing drums on the disc was session drummer Simon Dawson. The LP, released in 1990, produced a Top 30 US hit, \\"For You\\". Quick to follow was \\"One Hot Country\\", included on the soundtrack for the 1991 action film If Looks Could Kill. The Outfield returned with 1992's Rockeye. Its leadoff single, \\"Closer to Me\\", was a near Top 40 hit, and a second release, \\"Winning It All\\", gained some notice due to extensive play during NBC's NBA Finals coverage, NBA Superstars series featuring Larry Bird, the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics and the film The Mighty Ducks.

There were several reasons behind this war. As German nationalism grew strongly inside the German Confederation and neither could decide on how Germany was going to be unified into a nation-state. The Austrians favoured the Greater Germany unification but were not willing to give up any of the non-German-speaking land inside of the Austrian Empire and take second place to Prussia. The Prussians however wanted to unify Germany as Little Germany primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia, whilst excluding Austria. In the final battle of the German war (Battle of Königgrätz) the Prussians successfully defeated the Austrians and succeeded in creating the North German Confederation.

At the age of 19 years and 253 days, he became not only the first Indian centurion in IPL but the youngest player to score a hundred in the IPL history. On May 21st, 2009, Manish Pandey debuted for the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) against the Deccan Chargers. As a right-handed middle-order batsman, his incredible innings of 114 not out (off 73 balls) was instrumental in helping RCB post a competitive total of 170 for 4 in their 20 overs. With ten fours and four sixes, Pandey maintained a remarkable strike rate of 156.16. His exceptional performance allowed RCB to win the match comfortably by 12 runs. Manish Pandey's IPL centurion feat paved the way for other Indian players to demonstrate their talent and potential in this prestigious cricket tournament. Over the years, the IPL has become a significant platform for many players to showcase their skills and gain exposure to international cricket.

Hong Kong (CNN) -- An Australian teenager reported missing two months ago has been found alive in dense bushland not far from his home, local police say. Matthew Allen, 18, was last seen at his family home near Westleigh, a suburb about 30 kilometers (20 miles) away from Sydney, on November 27. Police feared the worst as the teen had not taken his mobile phone with him or accessed his bank accounts.

''He was completely exhausted, completely dehydrated, suffered significant weight loss, somewhere up to 50%. He was suffering from partial blindness and he had leeches all over him.''

While in the town, a newly arrived, green recruit shoots and kills a street merchant. Major Bandura calmly puts a pistol in the dead man's hand and hustles his company out of town.

The first big battle scene of the film, the guerrillas attack with small arms and a high-caliber machine gun from a hillside. The fuel trucks are instantly destroyed, and the Soviet troops are pinned behind their tanks. Bandura orders the crew out of one tank and heroically uses the tank to push the burning trucks off the road, a dangerous maneuver. Bandura catches up with Gulakhan and has his sergeant beat and interrogate him. Gulahkan confesses nothing and is allowed to drive away with his young son.

Morocco leather is made from the skin of which animals?","completion":"Morocco leather is a high-quality, soft, and flexible leather that is highly valued for its durability and attractiveness. It has historically been associated with luxury and has been used for book bindings, upholstery, fashion accessories, and various other purposes. This type of leather is made from the skins of several animals, most notably goats but also sheep and, to a lesser extent, cattle. 1. Goats: Goatskin is the most commonly used material for producing Morocco leather due to its unique qualities. Goatskin is strong, supple, and takes on the natural grain pattern of the animal's skin, resulting in a beautiful textured look. Goat hides are sourced from various parts of the world, with some of the most desirable coming from the Middle East, North Africa, particularly Morocco, thus giving the leather its name. 2. Sheep: Sheepskin is also sometimes used to create Morocco leather. The skins of sheep tend to be thinner and slightly less durable than goat hides, but they still produce a high-quality leather with a fine and soft texture. Sheepskin is particularly prized for its ability to take on a wide range of vibrant colors when dyed, making it highly sought after for bookbinding and other decorative purposes. 3. Cattle: Although less common in Morocco leather production, calfskin or cowhide can also be utilized in certain cases. These types of leather are generally heavier and thicker than goat or sheepskins and are characterized by a more pronounced grain pattern. While these qualities can make them slightly less supple than goat or sheep leather, they are still well-suited for crafting premium, long-lasting items such as shoes, bags, and furniture upholstery. The process of creating Morocco leather typically involves several steps, regardless of the animal skin used. First, the raw hides are soaked, washed, and cleaned to remove dirt, hair, and other impurities. They are then limed and loosened with a solution to break down the skin's proteins and fibers. This step is crucial in making the leather more flexible and easier to work with. Next, the leather is tanned, which involves treating it with vegetable tannins derived from tree bark, leaves, and fruits. Tanning not only preserves the leather but also enhances its natural colors and grain patterns. The tanned leather is then soaked in a dye bath to take on the desired color. Traditional Moroccan dyes were derived from natural sources like indigo, cochineal, and tannin-rich woods, but today synthetic dyes are more frequently used to achieve a wider range of colors. After dyeing, the leather is stretched, softened, and finished by the skilled artisans. Some Morocco leather is adorned with additional decorative elements, such as hand-tooling, gilding, or embossing, to create intricate patterns or designs that enhance the leather's natural beauty. In conclusion, Morocco leather is primarily made from the skins of goats, sheep, and, to a lesser extent, cattle. The resulting leather is highly cherished for its softness, durability, and richly textured appearance. With a long history of use in luxury goods and decorative applications, Morocco leather continues to be a popular choice for those seeking a high-quality leather that exudes elegance and refinement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Director and State Health Officer Dr. Karen Smith today announced the department is investigating a case of human plague in California, and conducting an environmental evaluation in the Stanislaus National Forest, Yosemite National Park and the surrounding areas. The department began investigating this incident after a child from Los Angeles County became ill and was hospitalized after visiting the Stanislaus National Forest and camping at Crane Flat Campground in Yosemite National Park in mid-July. No other members of the camping party reported symptoms and health officials are continuing to monitor the child’s family and treatment providers. The child is recovering. Plague is an infectious bacterial disease that is carried by squirrels, chipmunks and other wild rodents and their fleas. When an infected rodent becomes sick and dies, its fleas can carry the infection to other warm-blooded animals or humans. “Human cases of plague are rare, with the last reported human infection in California occurring in 2006,” Dr. Smith said. “Although this is a rare disease, people should protect themselves from infection by avoiding any contact with wild rodents. Never feed squirrels, chipmunks, or other rodents in picnic or campground areas, and never touch sick or dead rodents. Protect your pets from fleas and keep them away from wild animals,” Dr. Smith added. CDPH is working closely with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Yosemite National Park and the U. S. Forest Service to investigate the source of the infection, and the patient’s travel history and activities during the incubation period. As a precaution, Yosemite National Park will provide additional information to visitors about steps to prevent plague exposure, and post caution signs at the Crane Flat campground and nearby campgrounds. Steps the public can take to avoid exposure to human plague include: Never feed squirrels, chipmunks or other rodents and never touch sick or dead rodents Avoid walking, hiking or camping near rodent burrows Wear long pants tucked into socks or boot tops to reduce exposure to fleas Spray insect repellent containing DEET on socks and pant cuffs to reduce exposure to fleas Keep wild rodents out of homes, trailers, and outbuildings and away from pets. Early symptoms of plague include high fever, chills, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpit or groin. People who develop these symptoms should seek immediate medical attention and notify their health care provider that they have been camping or out in the wilderness and have been exposed to rodents and fleas. Plague is treatable in its early stages with prompt diagnosis and proper antibiotic treatment. If not treated, plague can be fatal. In California, plague-infected animals are most likely to be found in the foothills and mountains and to a lesser extent, along the coast. Desert and Central Valley areas are considered low risk for plague. State and local health officials regularly monitor plague-prone areas by testing animals and their fleas. In 2014, non-human plague activity was detected in animals in seven counties: El Dorado, Mariposa, Modoc, Plumas, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Sierra. Plague is not transmitted from human to human, unless a patient with plague also has a lung infection and is coughing. There have been no known cases of human-to-human infection in California since 1924. LACDPH and CDPH believe the risk of human-to-human transmission is similarly low in this case. The last reported cases of human plague in California occurred in 2005 and 2006 in Mono, Los Angeles and Kern counties and all three patients survived following treatment with antibiotics. Since 1970, 42 human cases of plague have been confirmed in California, of which nine were fatal. The CDPH website has plague information, including precautions people can take to minimize their risk.

But one arrival this summer is definitely not welcome: the plague. California's Department of Public Health and the national park announced Thursday that a child who visited nearby Stanislaus National Forest and camped at Yosemite's Crane Flat Campground in mid-July had contracted the plague. That child is recovering, and no other members of the camping party have reported any related symptoms. 7 photos: Plague: a scourge of biblical proportions 7 photos: Plague: a scourge of biblical proportions This is what causes the plague.

In 2012, for instance, three park visitors died after contracting hantavirus. Yet plague cases are rare not just in Yosemite, but across the United States. The disease killed millions centuries ago, and -- while it can be treated with modern medicine such as antibiotics and antimicrobial -- it's never gone away. Adult dies of plague in Colorado The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the United States has about seven annual cases, over 80% of which have been in the bubonic form. There have been three cases reported so far in 2015, which is in line with those numbers. The other two happened in Colorado and both resulted in deaths, one being a teenager in Larimer County and the other an adult in Pueblo County, as announced Wednesday by the local health department. The Yosemite case is California's first instance of human plague since 2006, according to state health officer Dr. Karen Smith, when there were three cases in Mono, Los Angeles and Kern counties. There have been 42 such cases in the state since 1970, of which nine proved fatal. \\"Although this is a rare disease, people should protect themselves from infection by avoiding any contact with wild rodents,\\" Smith said.

During this state, individuals may be more susceptible to suggestions or able to access hidden memories or insights, as their conscious mind is less active and more open to new information. Other possibilities mentioned, such as sleepwalking, memory loss, or confusion, might be experienced in different situations or under specific circumstances. Hypnotized is another term that can be related to trance, but being hypnotized doesn't necessarily mean a person will always feel peaceful.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: The musical opened on Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a 500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of 100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\".The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations.

James Whale (22 July 1889 - 29 May 1957) was an English film director, theater director and actor. He is best remembered for his four classic horror films: Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Whale also directed films in other genres, including what is considered the definitive film version of the musical Show Boat (1936). He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, but many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity. After the armistice he returned to Birmingham and tried to find work as a cartoonist. He sold two cartoons to the Bystander in 1919 but was unable to secure a permanent position. Later that year he embarked on a professional stage career. Under the tutelage of actor-manager Nigel Playfair, he worked as an actor, set designer and builder, \\"stage director\\" (akin to a stage manager) and director. In 1922, while with Playfair, he met Doris Zinkeisen. They were considered a couple for some two years, despite Whale's living as an openly gay man. They were reportedly engaged in 1924, but by 1925 the engagement was off. In 1928 Whale was offered the opportunity to direct two private performances of R.C. Sherriff's then-unknown play Journey's End for the Incorporated Stage Society, a theatre society that mounted private Sunday performances of plays. Set over a four-day period in March 1918 in the trenches at Saint-Quentin, France, Journey's End gives a glimpse into the experiences of the officers of a British infantry company in World War I. The key conflict is between Capt. Stanhope, the company commander, and Lt. Raleigh, the brother of Stanhope's fiancee. Whale offered the part of Stanhope to the then barely known Laurence Olivier. Olivier initially declined the role, but after meeting the playwright agreed to take it on. Maurice Evans was cast as Raleigh. The play was well received and transferred to the Savoy Theatre in London's West End, opening on 21 January 1929. A young Colin Clive was now in the lead role, Olivier having accepted an offer to take the lead in a production of Beau Geste. The play was a tremendous success, with critics uniform and effusive in their praise and with audiences sometimes sitting in stunned silence following its conclusion only to burst into thunderous ovations. As Whale biographer James Curtis wrote, the play \\"managed to coalesce, at the right time and in the right manner, the impressions of a whole generation of men who were in the war and who had found it impossible, through words or deeds, to adequately express to their friends and families what the trenches had been like\\". After three weeks at the Savoy, Journey's End transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for the next two years. With the success of Journey's End at home, Broadway producer Gilbert Miller acquired the rights to mount a New York production with an all-British cast headed by Colin Keith-Johnston as Stanhope and Derek Williams as Raleigh. Whale also directed this version, which premiered at Henry Miller's Theatre on 22 March 1929. The play ran for over a year and cemented its reputation as the greatest play about World War I.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How did the public take his directorng?","completion":"The public's reaction to James Whale's directing can be inferred from the quote: \\"The play was a tremendous success, with critics uniform and effusive in their praise and with audiences sometimes sitting in stunned silence following its conclusion only to burst into thunderous ovations.\\" This suggests that the public greatly appreciated his directing and were deeply affected by the performances he directed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By 1916, \\"successful attacks were measured in thousands of yards and paid for by casualties in the hundreds of thousands.\\"General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), an elderly member of the French General Staff, arrives from Paris at the headquarters (a magnificent chateau) of his subordinate, General Paul Mireau (George Macready), to inform him that a major offensive is planned for General Mireau's sector and, in preparation for this offensive, General Broulard wants Mireau's division to capture a well-defended German position nicknamed the 'Anthill'. Mireau balks at the idea, claiming that his division is in no condition to defend the Anthill, much less capture it. Broulard reluctantly mentions that, in a completely unrelated matter, he was thinking that Mireau was due for a promotion, not that this should sway his decision concerning the feasibility of an attack on the Anthill. After explaining to Broulard at great length that the men he commands mean more to him than \\"all the stars and decorations in France,\\" the ambitious Mireau concludes that an attack on the Anthill just might work.Mireau undertakes an inspection of the front line trenches with his loyal and cynical staff officer, Major Saint-Auban (Richard Anderson). The general stops to ask several soldiers (who later become major characters) the question, \\"Ready to kill more Germans?\\" When one soldier (Fred Bell) fails to answer, merely staring straight ahead, his comrades reply that the soldier is suffering from shell shock. Mireau says there is no such thing as shell shock.

For a long time after Mom died, I thought I liked her more because I didn't like your attitude and I thought that her softer side was more desirable. In my 15-year-old's mind, I thought you could have stopped my mother from drinking herself to death. Instead, you were off playing tennis and working. Later, I realized that no one could make someone stop drinking. Support is important, but at the end of the day, it is a choice. You were just doing your best. What I have learned is that I am much like you. You taught me self-confidence. I know if I am prepared to work hard enough for something, I will be successful. This is no small thing. What I've realized since you died is that you were always there for me. You fought to ensure that I got my place on the Quebec badminton team that I had earned. When I got divorced , you came up to see if I had what I needed to take care of the boys and you paid off my car. You taught me not to spend money I don't have. I've always kept to that rule. It has served me well. We always had a good home to live in, nice vacations, and everything we needed and most of what we wanted. You were not a perfect parent and neither am I.

A surfboard not too tall, however, will give you some authority when you approach a wave. You can rent a board 24-48 inches (61-91 cm) or taller if you plan to ride the longboard as a novice.. (2). Rent your board at a local surf shop or find a friend with an extra board you can borrow. Wax your longboard to make it less slippery.. (3). If you're just starting out, buying a board 14 feet (2.4 m) or taller would work. Check the lifespan requirements in your city before you buy a board.. (4). They're especially helpful for beginners that may lack the strength to jump and dive from a great distance. Find a board that's 1.5-3.5 feet (0.91-1.8 m) tall... The answer should be","completion":"(5). So, when you want to learn how to ride a longboard, first find a big surfboard that is 8 feet or taller, because it helps you stay balanced and catch little waves more easily. Then, make sure to get a smaller board if you are just starting, but not too small so you can control it when you go near a wave. Ask a friend or go to a store where they have surfboards to get one, and put some special wax on it so you won't slip off. Remember, a longboard between 1.5 and 3.5 feet is good for beginners because it's easier to use when you're learning. Have fun and be safe while riding your longboard!"},{"prompt":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

In 2001, 11-year-old Kevin Stephan was a bat boy for his younger brother's Little League team in Lancaster, New York. It was an early evening in late July. Kevin was standing on the grass away from the plate, where another youngster was warming up for the next game. Swinging his bat back and forth, giving it all the power an elementary school kid could give. The boy brought the bat back hard and hit Kevin in the chest. His heart stopped. When Kevin fell to the ground, the mother of one of the players rushed out of the stands to his aid. Penny Brown hadn't planned to be there that day, but at the last minute, her shift at the hospital had been changed to see her son's performance. She was given the night off. Penny bent over the senseless boy, his face already starting to turn blue, and giving CPR, breathing into his mouth and giving chest compressions. And he _ in the end. After his recovery, he became a volunteer junior firefighter, learning some of the emergency first-aid techniques that had saved his life. He studied hard in school and was saving money for college by working as a dishwasher in a local restaurant in his spare time. Kevin, now 18, was working in the kitchen when he heard people screaming, customers in confusion, employees rushing toward a table. He hurried into the main room and saw a woman there, her face turning blue, her hands at her throat. She was choking.

However, there are slight differences in sentence structure and word choices that may impact the way readers interpret each sentence. (1) In the first sentence, the structure is \\"However, species such as 'T. eurycephalus' had a shorter rostrum and a lower skull.\\" The word \\"however\\" is used at the beginning, indicating a contrast or exception to a statement made previously. The adjective \\"lower\\" is used to describe the skull, which could mean that the skull may be lower in height or lower in position compared to other skulls, depending on the context. The sentence implies that \\"T. eurycephalus\\" is an example of a species with these particular characteristics. (2) In the second sentence, the structure is \\"Species such as 'T. eurycephalus' however had a shorter rostrum and a deeper skull.\\" Here, \\"however\\" is placed in the middle of the sentence, and it serves the same purpose as in the first sentence, to indicate contrast. The adjective \\"deeper\\" is used instead of \\"lower\\" for describing the skull. \\"Deeper\\" implies that the skull is more prominent or extends further inwards, which might not be the exact same as a \\"lower\\" skull, as implied in the first sentence. Again, the sentence indicates that \\"T. eurycephalus\\" exemplifies a species with these characteristics. In summary, while both sentences convey similar meanings and discuss the unique features of \\"T. eurycephalus,\\" there are slight differences in their structure and word choices.

Context: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff. But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his... Guess a valid title for it!

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Valkyrie Context: During World War II, Wehrmacht Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise) is severely wounded during an RAF air raid in Tunisia, losing his right hand, the ring and little finger on his left hand, and his left eye, and is evacuated home to Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, Major General Henning von Tresckow (Branagh) attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler by smuggling a bomb aboard the FÃ¼hrer's personal airplane. The bomb, however, is a dud and fails to detonate, and Tresckow flies to Berlin in order to safely retrieve it. After learning that the Gestapo has arrested Major General Hans Oster, he orders General Olbricht (Nighy) to find a replacement. After recruiting Stauffenberg into the German Resistance, Olbricht presents Stauffenberg at a meeting of the secret committee which has coordinated previous attempts on Hitler's life. The members include General Ludwig Beck (Stamp), Dr. Carl Goerdeler (McNally), and Erwin von Witzleben (Schofield). Stauffenberg is stunned to learn that no plans exist on the subject of what is to be done after Hitler's assassination. During a bombing raid on Berlin, he gets the idea of using Operation Valkyrie, which involves the deployment of the Reserve Army to maintain order in the event of a national emergency. The plotters carefully redraft the plan's orders so that they can dismantle the Nazi rÃ©gime after assassinating Hitler. Realizing that only General Friedrich Fromm (Wilkinson), the head of the Reserve Army, can initiate Valkyrie, they offer him a position as head of the Wehrmacht in a post-Nazi Germany and request his support, but Fromm declines to be directly involved, stating he will not side with them so long as Hitler is alive. With the rewritten Operation Valkyrie orders needing to be signed by Hitler (Bamber), Stauffenberg visits the FÃ¼hrer at his Berghof estate in Bavaria. Fromm's influence allows Stauffenberg to bring the copy directly before Hitler, and in the presence of Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann GÃ¶ring, Wilhelm Keitel and Albert Speer, his inner circle,...

Like Guccifer 2.0, the self-proclaimed hacker apparently responsible for burrowing into the Democratic National Committee computer network, then sending stolen emails to WikiLeaks. According to a new report by The Daily Beast, Guccifer, who'd long been presenting as a solo, independent hacker from Romania, infiltrating the DNC, has reportedly been exposed as working from Russia. And they would have got away with it if it wasn't for a damn VPN. SEE ALSO: The 6 best VPNs to help keep you anonymous on the internet The Guccifer persona apparently neglected to switch on the VPN client before logging on once. As a result,\\" the report reads, \\"he left a real, Moscow-based Internet Protocol address in the server logs of an American social media company, according to a source familiar with the government’s Guccifer investigation.\\" Yep, Moscow. U.S. investigators used that IP address to connect Guccifer to a Russian foreign military intelligence agency known as GRU, according to the Daily Beast's sources. It's important to note that this claim hasn't been confirmed by the U.S. government. In January 2017, U.S. intelligence officials linked Guccifer 2.0 to the Russian spying agency with \\"high confidence,\\" but didn't confirm the link unequivocally. Guccifer 2.0 leaked DNC materials to Wikileaks and pretty much any GOP operative that wanted the goods. The hack exposed embarrassing details about Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC's inner workings. It was a boon for President Donald Trump ahead of the election. Finding a link between Russia and the DNC hack was a priority for U.S. investigators from the start. Kyle Ehmke, an intelligence researcher at cyber security firm ThreatConnect who previously led an investigation into Guccifer's identity, told the Daily Beast ThreatConnect tried to track the persona through their email metadata — which always led them to a French data centre. \\"Almost immediately various cyber security companies and individuals were skeptical of Guccifer 2.0 and the backstory that he had generated for himself,” Ehmke told the publisher. “We started seeing these inconsistencies that led back to the idea that he was created hastily … by the individual or individuals that affected the DNC compromise.\\" Guccifer was reportedly using a service called Elite VPN, which indeed existed in France — but had Russian headquarters. Then, it was a case of Robert Mueller and his team tracking the one-off IP address to none other than GRU HQ on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow. VPNs huh? UPDATE: March 28, 2018, 12:19 p.m. AEDT This story has been updated to reflect that Kyle Ehmke was discussing previous investigations on behalf of ThreatConnect into Guccifer 2.0 with the Daily Beast. ThreatConnect does not have ties to the recent discovery. ||||| Update, 7/13/2018: Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office identified Guccifer 2.0 as a Russian intelligence officer and indicted him along with 11 other officers for crimes related to the alleged hacking of Democrats in 2016. Guccifer 2.0, the “lone hacker” who took credit for providing WikiLeaks with stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, was in fact an officer of Russia’s military intelligence directorate (GRU), The Daily Beast has learned. It’s an attribution that resulted from a fleeting but critical slip-up in GRU tradecraft. That forensic determination has substantial implications for the criminal probe into potential collusion between President Donald Trump and Russia. The Daily Beast has learned that the special counsel in that investigation, Robert Mueller, has taken over the probe into Guccifer and brought the FBI agents who worked to track the persona onto his team. While it’s unclear what Mueller plans to do with Guccifer, his last round of indictments charged 13 Russians tied to the Internet Research Agency troll farm with a conspiracy “for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.” It was Mueller’s first move establishing Russian interference in the election within a criminal context, but it stopped short of directly implicating the Putin regime. Mueller’s office declined to comment for this story. But the attribution of Guccifer 2.0 as an officer of Russia’s largest foreign intelligence agency would cross the Kremlin threshold—and move the investigation closer to Trump himself. “ The attribution of Guccifer 2.0 as an officer of Russia’s largest foreign intelligence agency brings the investigation closer to the Kremlin’s doorstep—and to Trump himself. ” Trump’s longtime political adviser Roger Stone admitted being in touch with Guccifer over Twitter’s direct messaging service. And in August 2016, Stone published an article on the pro-Trump-friendly Breitbart News calling on his political opponents to “Stop Blaming Russia” for the hack. “I have some news for Hillary and Democrats—I think I’ve got the real culprit,” he wrote. “It doesn’t seem to be the Russians that hacked the DNC, but instead a hacker who goes by the name of Guccifer 2.0.” Five months later, in January 2017, the CIA, NSA, and FBI assessed “with high confidence” that “Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release US victim data.” But the assessment did not directly call Guccifer a Russian intelligence officer. Nor did it provide any evidence for its assertions. It turns out there is a powerful reason to connect Guccifer to the GRU. Guccifer 2.0 sprang into existence on June 15, 2016, hours after a report by a computer security firm forensically tied Russia to an intrusion at the Democratic National Committee. In a series of blog posts and tweets over the following seven months—conspicuously ending right as Trump took office and not resuming—the Guccifer persona published a smattering of the DNC documents while gamely projecting an image as an independent Romanian hacktivist who’d breached the DNC on a lark. As Stone’s Breitbart piece demonstrated, Guccifer provided Moscow with a counter-narrative for the election interference. Guccifer famously pretended to be a “lone hacker” who perpetrated the digital DNC break-in. From the outset, few believed it. Motherboard conducted a devastating interview with Guccifer that exploded the account’s claims of being a native Romanian speaker. Based on forensic clues in some of Guccifer’s leaks, and other evidence, a consensus quickly formed among security experts that Guccifer was completely notional. “Almost immediately various cyber security companies and individuals were skeptical of Guccifer 2.0 and the backstory that he had generated for himself,” said Kyle Ehmke, an intelligence researcher at the cyber security firm ThreatConnect. “We started seeing these inconsistencies that led back to the idea that he was created hastily… by the individual or individuals that affected the DNC compromise.” Proving that link definitively was harder. Ehmke worked on an investigation at ThreatConnect that tried to track down Guccifer from the metadata in his emails. But the trail always ended at the same data center in France. Ehmke eventually uncovered that Guccifer was connecting through an anonymizing service called Elite VPN, a virtual private networking service that had an exit point in France but was headquartered in Russia. “ Working off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0 as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency’s headquarters on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow. ” But on one occasion, The Daily Beast has learned, Guccifer failed to activate the VPN client before logging on. As a result, he left a real, Moscow-based Internet Protocol address in the server logs of an American social media company, according to a source familiar with the government’s Guccifer investigation. Twitter and WordPress were Guccifer 2.0’s favored outlets. Neither company would comment for this story, and Guccifer did not respond to a direct message on Twitter. Working off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0 as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency’s headquarters on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow. (The Daily Beast’s sources did not disclose which particular officer worked as Guccifer.) Security firms and declassified U.S. intelligence findings previously identified the GRU as the agency running “Fancy Bear,” the 10-year-old hacking organization behind the DNC email theft, as well as breaches at NATO, Obama’s White House, a French television station, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and countless NGOs, and military and civilian agencies in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Timestamps in Guccifer 2.0’s first leaks show they were packaged for release over the course of a single day in June 2016, beginning just hours after the DNC intrusion and its attribution to Russia were made public. The moniker was an homage to Romanian hacker Marcel Lazăr Lehel, who as “Guccifer” achieved notoriety in 2013 for a string of hacks against celebrities and politicians. In his inaugural blog post, Guccifer 2.0 disputed Russia’s involvement and claimed credit personally for the DNC breach, positioning himself as a one-man hacking operation working to expose “the Illuminati.” The post included the world’s first glimpse of the enormous cache of documents siphoned from the DNC’s network, including the Democrats’ opposition research report on Trump. Presaging the leaks that would roil the election, Guccifer 2.0 declared that he’d already sent the bulk of the stolen material to WikiLeaks—which has spent the time since obfuscating whether Guccifer was its source. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks began releasing its cache of approximately 19,000 emails and 8,000 attachments stolen in the hack. While Trump promoted the leak on Twitter and in rallies, his surrogate Roger Stone pushed back against the Kremlin attribution. In his August 2016 article for Breitbart, he argued that Guccifer 2.0 was the Romanian hacktivist he claimed to be. “Guccifer 2.0 is the real deal,” he wrote. Last May, Stone admitted that he’d also exchanged direct messages with the Guccifer 2.0 persona, and he released what he claimed was a complete transcript of his communications with the account. The transcript is brief and banal, showing Stone congratulating Guccifer 2.0 on returning to Twitter after a brief suspension, and then mostly ignoring him. Then and since, Stone has consistently denied that Guccifer was connected to the Kremlin. “I myself had no contacts or communications with the Russian State, Russian Intelligence or anyone fronting for them or acting as intermediaries for them,” he wrote. “ I myself had no contacts or communications with the Russian State, Russian Intelligence or anyone fronting for them or acting as intermediaries for them. ” — Roger Stone Guccifer 2.0 maintained a sporadic online presence throughout the election, posting to his dedicated WordPress blog and on Twitter, and spilling more DNC documents, sometimes in private emails to journalists. While the national election clearly interested him (“Democrats prepare new provocation against Trump,” he thundered in October 2016), Guccifer 2.0 reached down the ballot as well, posting documents from the Democrats’ national campaign committee on his WordPress blog. There, readers could find internal Democratic candidate assessments relevant to battleground states like Pennsylvania and Florida; internal assessments of key congressional districts, with granular analyses of their demographics; and campaign recruitment material. The GRU officer was eager to share this trove, as well. A GOP political operative in Florida, Aaron Nevins, DM’d Guccifer 2.0 a request for “any Florida based information” and received 2.5 gigabytes’ worth, according to The Wall Street Journal. The data, he enthused to Guccifer 2.0, was “probably worth millions of dollars.” A consultant for a successful Florida Republican congressional candidate told the paper, “I did adjust some voting targets based on some data I saw from the leaks.” Sometime after its hasty launch, the Guccifer persona was handed off to a more experienced GRU officer, according to a source familiar with the matter. The timing of that handoff is unclear, but Guccifer 2.0’s last blog post, from Jan. 12, 2017, evinced a far greater command of English than the persona’s earlier efforts. “It’s obvious that the intelligence agencies are deliberately falsifying evidence,” the post read. “In my opinion, they’re playing into the hands of the Democrats who are trying to blame foreign actors for their failure.” (Contrast that with the language from a June 2016 post: “I made some conclusions from the Marcel’s story and decided not to put all eggs in one basket. Moreover, other cases weren’t so successful and didn’t bring me the glory.”) Today the most popular counter-narrative surrounding Guccifer 2.0 concedes that the account was a fake persona but posits that it was created by the DNC to support a false-flag operation implicating Russia. In this theory, advanced in two widely cited anonymous blogs, Guccifer 2.0 was the DNC posing as Russia posing as a Romanian hacker. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Guccifer 2.0, the person claiming to be a hacker who broke into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) computer network, accidentally revealed himself as a Russian spy while forgetting to switch on a VPN client.

They are all engaged in studying something in their hands. 2. \\"The two boys and the man are all chatting to each other.\\" This statement suggests that the three individuals are engaged in a conversation. Now, let's determine if the latter statement logically follows the former: In the first statement, we know that the three individuals are focused on studying something in their hands. It's possible that they are concentrating on what they're studying and might not be talking to each other. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of them chatting as they study.

The speed is extremely slow. The advertised 20 pages or so per minute in black ink on draft mode is really misleading in my opinion because it does not provide a measurement of how fast it will print at a normal resolution.The draft mode printout is very dotty and light, and is not really suitable for anything in my opinion. The next level of print quality (there are 5 levels) takes very long. I think it took about 40 seconds or longer to print a color page.

After the disruption of the plot in Amman, it had not escaped notice in Washington that Hijazi had lived in California and driven a cab in Boston and that Deek was a naturalized U.S. citizen who, as Berger reminded President Clinton, had been in touch with extremists in the United States as well as abroad. Before Ressam's arrest, Berger saw no need to raise a public alarm at home- although the FBI put all field offices on alert. Now, following Ressam's arrest, the FBI asked for an unprecedented number of special wiretaps. Both Berger andTenet told us that their impression was that more Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretap requests were processed during the millennium alert than ever before. The next day, writing about Ressam's arrest and links to a cell in Montreal, Berger informed the President that the FBI would advise police in the United States to step up activities but would still try to avoid undue public alarm by stressing that the government had no specific information about planned attacks. At a December 22 meeting of the Small Group of principals, FBI Director Louis Freeh briefed officials from the NSC staff, CIA, and Justice on wiretaps and investigations inside the United States, including a Brooklyn entity tied to the Ressam arrest, a seemingly unreliable foreign report of possible attacks on seven U.S. cities, two Algerians detained on the Canadian border, and searches in Montreal related to a jihadist cell. The Justice Department released a statement on the alert the same day. Clarke's staff warned, \\"Foreign terrorist sleeper cells are present in the US and attacks in the US are likely.\\" Clarke asked Berger to try to make sure that the domestic agencies remained alert.\\" Is there a threat to civilian aircraft?\\"he wrote. Clarke also asked the principals in late December to discuss a foreign security service report about a Bin Laden plan to put bombs on transatlantic flights. The CSG met daily. Berger said that the principals met constantly. Later, when asked what made her decide to ask Ressam to step out of his vehicle, Diana Dean, a Customs inspector who referred Ressam to secondary inspection, testified that it was her \\"training and experience.\\" It appears that the heightened sense of alert at the national level played no role in Ressam's detention. There was a mounting sense of public alarm. The earlier Jordanian arrests had been covered in the press, and Ressam's arrest was featured on network evening news broadcasts throughout the Christmas season. The FBI was more communicative during the millennium crisis than it had ever been. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Special wiretaps\\" correctly answer the question \\"Following Ressam's arrest, which type of wiretap requests were being requested?\\"?","completion":"Yes, after Ressam's arrest, the FBI asked for an unprecedented number of special wiretaps.

Facing a serious challenge to his re-election prospects, Mayor Phlegmming (William Shatner) doubles down on his junk-food policies, ignoring their effect on Frank's health. This causes Frank to eat a boiled egg covered in filth, allowing Thrax (Laurence Fishburne), a deadly virus, to enter the throat. Unwilling to admit responsibility, Phlegmming instructs Frank to take a cold suppressant though brain signals.

To his displeasure, Ozzy is subsequently assigned to assist Drix in his investigation. Meanwhile, Thrax assumes leadership of a gang of sweat germs and launches an attack on the mucus dam in Frank's nose, nearly killing Drix before Ozzy rescues him. The two pay a visit to one of Ozzy's informants, who reveals Thrax's plan to pose as a mere cold virus as a cover for killing Frank with a high fever in order to become the next big virus in the medical records.

In May 1409, an uprising in Teutonic-held Samogitia started. Lithuania supported the uprising and the Knights threatened to invade. Poland announced its support for the Lithuanian cause and threatened to invade Prussia in return. As Prussian troops evacuated Samogitia, the Teutonic Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen declared war on the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania on 6 August 1409. The Knights hoped to defeat Poland and Lithuania separately and began by invading Greater Poland and Kuyavia, catching the Poles by surprise. The Knights burned the castle at Dobrin , captured Bobrowniki after a fourteen-day siege, conquered Bydgoszcz , and sacked several towns. The Poles organized counterattacks and recaptured Bydgoszcz. The Samogitians attacked Memel . However, neither side was ready for a full-scale war. Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, agreed to mediate the dispute. A truce was signed on 8 October 1409; it was set to expire on 24 June 1410. Both sides used this time for preparations for the battle, gathering the troops and engaging in diplomatic maneuvers. Both sides sent letters and envoys accusing each other of various wrongdoings and threats to Christendom. Wenceslaus, who received a gift of 60,000 florins from the Knights, declared that Samogitia rightfully belonged to the Knights and only Dobrzyń Land should be returned to Poland. The Knights also paid 300,000 ducats to Sigismund of Hungary, who had ambitions for the principality of Moldova, for his military assistance. Sigismund attempted to break the Polish-Lithuanian alliance by offering Vytautas a king's crown; Vytautas's acceptance of such a crown would violate the terms of the Ostrów Agreement and create Polish-Lithuanian discord.

She is the Premier of the Western Cape province, and a member of the Western Cape Provincial Parliament. She served as leader of the Democratic Alliance, the country's official opposition party, from 2007 to 2015 and as Mayor of Cape Town from 2006 to 2009. Zille is a former journalist and anti-apartheid activist and was one of the journalists who exposed the cover-up around the death of Black Consciousness leader Steve Biko while working for the Rand Daily Mail in the late 1970s. Following accusations that she was defending colonialism, Zille noted that her views had been misconstrued, but also apologised \\"unreservedly for a tweet that may have come across as a defence of colonialism. It was not.\\" Among those who disagreed with her were other DA members, such as Mbali Ntuli, who stated that colonialism was \\"only\\" negative, and who herself faces a disciplinary hearing in 2017 for \\"liking\\" in December 2016 a Facebook comment that characterised Zille as racist; Phumzile van Damme, who stated that there was not \\"a single aspect of [colonialism] that can be said to be positive or beneficial to Africans\\"; and party leader Mmusi Maimane, who stated \\"Colonialism, like Apartheid, was a system of oppression and subjugation. It can never be justified,\\" but also said in the aftermath that Zille was not a racist and that she had \\"consistently fought oppression\\". DA MP Ghaleb Cachalia defended Zille as well-intentioned. He agreed with her that colonialism was not solely negative, and noted that many prominent intellectuals, including Chinua Achebe, Ali Mazrui, Godfrey Mwakikagile and Manmohan Singh, have expressed similar sentiments. The ANC and Economic Freedom Fighters both demanded that Zille be removed from her position as Western Cape Premier. As a result of her online comments, Zille was referred to the DA's federal legal commission for a disciplinary hearing on charges of bringing the party into disrepute and damaging the party. Following this news, Zille further defended herself by noting that Nelson Mandela had held the same opinion about colonialism. Her continued defence of her comments exacerbated internal friction in the Democratic Alliance between her and her detractors, and was seen to undermine the party leader, Maimane. Maimane stated that the disciplinary charges against Zille were not limited to Twitter, and included \\"a series of comments [...] that have exacerbated and amplified the original tweet\\". Some of her subsequent writings, in which she defended her views, have increasingly strained her relationship with Maimane.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was the disciplinary hearing about?","completion":"The disciplinary hearing for Helen Zille was about her online comments on colonialism, which led to her being referred to the DA's federal legal commission.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"The supposed perturbation of more vegetation being available would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Justification: - The presence of more vegetation could affect the microclimate of an area by providing more shade, leading to lower environmental temperatures. This could reduce the need for the body to cool down as much, which might lead to less moisture being released from pores. - Additionally, plants release water vapor into the air during transpiration, which could increase humidity in the area. Higher humidity might reduce the effectiveness of evaporative cooling through sweating, since the air would be less able to absorb moisture. This could lead the body to either increase or decrease the amount of moisture being released through pores, depending on whether the body compensates for the reduced effectiveness of sweating. In both scenarios, the presence of more vegetation does not directly impact any specific step of the process.

The points brought up are: 1. Disappointment with Game Launches: The conversation starts with Kevin expressing his disappointment with yet another game launch that didn't meet expectations. This dissatisfaction might be due to bugs, incomplete features, or other issues. This problem seems to be recurring for Kevin, hinting at a pattern of pre-ordering games. 2. Discouragement of Pre-ordering Games: Joe advises Kevin not to pre-order games. He suggests that pre-ordering often leads to disappointment as the games might not meet the anticipated expectations at launch. He also implies that game performance and functionality upon launch can often be inadequate. 3. Attractiveness of Pre-Order Bonuses: In response, Kevin mentions the allure of \\"fancy bonuses\\" that come with pre-ordering games. These bonuses can include exclusive features, special characters, early access, or other in-game incentives that are used to entice consumers to pre-order. 4. Waiting for Ultimate or Game of the Year Editions: Joe counters by stating he usually waits for the \\"ultimate game of the year\\" edition, suggesting that these editions not only include the initially offered bonuses but also additional improvements. He argues that these versions of the game are more polished and usually cost-effective. 5. Influence of Peer Discussions: Kevin then brings up the problem of falling behind in discussions when he does not play the new game immediately as his friends may already be discussing the next game. 6. Gaming for Personal Enjoyment: Joe shows a different mentality about gaming from Kevin, as he mentions he plays games to have fun, not to discuss them with others. He emphasizes that experiencing glitches or problems with a game during its launch is not a fun experience and hence discourages pre-ordering. 7. Differences in Perspectives: Characters' personalities and viewpoints are revealed. Kevin seems more eager to be in sync with the latest trends and discussions, while Joe takes a more patient and practical approach to gaming.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The concept of the movie is explained in a voiceover intro by G. W. Bailey, who wonders what it would be like if one of the 1930s/1940s Rex O'Herlihan movies were to be made today. At that point, in a scene reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz, the cinematography shifts from black and white to color and the soundtrack changes from mono to surround sound. As a consequence of this paradigm shift, Rex O'Herlihan, a \\"singing cowboy\\", is the only character aware of the plot outline. He explains that he \\"knows the future\\" inasmuch as \\"these Western towns are all the same\\" and that it's his \\"karma\\" to \\"ride into a town, help the good guys, who are usually poor for some reason, against the bad guys, who are usually rich for some reason, and ride out again\\". Rex's knowledge is also connected to the unspecified \\"root\\" vegetables he digs up and eats. On his high-stepping horse Wildfire, Rex rides into the town of Oakwood Estates, walks into a saloon and meets Peter, the Town Drunk. In exchange for a free drink, Peter explains the background: the town, and especially the sheep herders (\\"nice enough, but they smell God-awful\\"), are being terrorized by the cattle ranchers, headed by Colonel Ticonderoga. Also there is Miss Tracy, the traditional Prostitute with a Heart of Gold. A local sheriff is \\"a corrupt old coward who takes his orders from the Colonel\\".

Question: Process: - A mold spore floats through the air - The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward - The mold sends out spores. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a working dish washer happens, how will it affect spores have surfaced in the air. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the original process The original process described is the life cycle of a mold spore whereby the spore floats through the air, lands on a piece of bread, grows hyphae into the bread, forms a colony, produces sporangiophores, and eventually sends out new spores. Step 2: Identify the perturbation The perturbation introduced here is the presence of a working dishwasher. Step 3: Consider possible effects of the perturbation on the process A dishwasher produces steam, heat, and humidity while it operates, which could potentially change the environment in which mold spores float through the air. We need to analyze how these factors might influence the mold spore life cycle. Step 4: Assess the direct or indirect effects of the perturbation - Direct Effects: The steam, heat, and humidity produced by a working dishwasher might make it difficult for mold spores to remain airborne. The increased humidity and moisture levels could cause the spores to become heavier, making it more likely for them to settle onto surfaces. This could potentially contribute to the spores landing on the bread more quickly. Furthermore, the heat generated by the dishwasher could potentially kill some mold spores that come into contact with it. - Indirect Effects: The working dishwasher might create a microclimate in the surrounding area, causing increased moisture and humidity levels that may influence mold growth on the bread. Additionally, the dishwasher might produce airborne particles, such as detergent residues, that could attach to mold spores, altering their ability to adhere to surfaces or germinate. Step 5: Conclusion While the presence of a working dishwasher could have both direct and indirect effects on the life cycle of mold spores, these effects would be more regional and localized in nature. A working dishwasher could influence spores' ability to remain airborne, potentially hastening their landing on surfaces like bread. Furthermore, the environmental factors produced by the dishwasher could affect mold growth overall. Nonetheless, the mold spore life cycle would still generally follow the same overall process, with some alterations in the specific factors affecting spore dispersal and growth."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Maggie for the following movie plot: Tight-lipped Englishman Alex Hughes (Alan Rickman) arrives in Northern Ontario on his way to meet the woman with whom he had a son. He is bullied by an altogether unconventional but lovable 19 year-old hitch-hiker, Vivienne (Emily Hampshire), who needs a ride to her hometown of Wawa. When the car is hit by a truck on the outskirts of her home town, Vivienne dies instantly. Alex finds himself, for the second time in his life, grieving for someone he never knew.Shocked and stranded in snowbound Wawa, Alex is drawn to seek out Vivienne's mother, to talk to her in person about the fate of her daughter. He also goes armed with trinkets and children's amusements that Vivienne has picked up along the way for her mother. Alex knocks on the door and comes face to face with Linda Freeman (Sigourney Weaver).Linda is no ordinary Mother. Alex soon becomes aware that Linda is an adult autistic, albeit a high-functioning one. He becomes increasingly involved in Linda's life and the community to which she feels complete indifference, in large part because of her condition. Linda, in turn, becomes attached--as attached as she is emotionally capable of--to Alex and what he can do for her.Alex also forms a relationship with Linda's sassy independent neighbor, Maggie (Carrie-Anne Moss), and is the object of scrutiny by the ineffectual local law enforcement officer Clyde (James Allodi), who, aside from being jealous of Alex's relationship with Maggie, believes he's discovered a dark secret in Alex's past.When Alex finally gets back on the road, he has exorcised his inner demons, and the town he leaves behind has also been transformed.

Context: 2018 is a congressional election year in the United States, and President Donald Trump is urging his supporters to get motivated to vote as both parties prepare for November. \\"The people who voted for us become complacent a little bit, they are happy,\\" Trump told supporters during a recent speech on tax reform in Cincinnati. \\"They sort of take it for granted, they sit back and then they get clobbered because the other people are desperate and they get out, and they have more energy.\\" Trump predicted that Republicans will do better than expected in November when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are at stake and 34 of the 100 Senate seats. \\"I think because of what we've done, because of the tremendous success we've had, I have a feeling that we are going to do incredibly well in '18, and I have to say this, history is not on our side,\\" he said. The president is right. History is not on his side. Midterms are typically unkind to the president's party, which on average loses about 30 House seats and a handful of Senate seats. The losses are worse if the president's approval rating is below 50 percent, which could be the case this year. Trump's approval rating has ticked up in recent weeks, but the average has him just above 40 percent, not a strong position with a midterm looming. \\"You know, you have a very unpopular president.

In this situation, Jesse called Carson's friend to inform her about the game that night. It is important to understand Carson's possible thoughts, feelings, and actions in response to this information, and how it will affect their decision-making process. Carson's friend has been informed about the game, which can lead to an assumption that there is an interest shared by both parties, and they may wish to attend or participate in the game together. Carson's potential next action could be either to discuss the game with the friend or to make arrangements for attending the game jointly. Ignoring the concern would not be a constructive course of action, as it would disregard the effort made by Jesse to relay this information to Carson's friend and the possible implications it may have on their relationship dynamics or social plans. Moreover, by choosing to ignore the concern or dismiss the matter, Carson would be disregarding their friend's feelings, desires, and any potential excitement surrounding the game. This could come across as insensitive or aloof, leading to a strain or deterioration in their relationship.

Is the premise \\"Three dogs trot on a stretch of grass, and one dog is carrying a tennis ball.\\" true if \\"The dogs are enjoying the park.\\"?","completion":"It is important to identify that the relationship between the premise \\"Three dogs trot on a stretch of grass, and one dog is carrying a tennis ball\\" and the statement \\"The dogs are enjoying the park\\" is not inherently causal in nature. Each statement makes an independent observation without necessarily confirming or denying the accuracy of the other statement. However, by combining the information provided by both statements, we can attempt to evaluate the truth of the premise while also considering the second statement. Given the premise that \\"Three dogs trot on a stretch of grass, and one dog is carrying a tennis ball,\\" we can conclude that: 1. There are three dogs present in the scene. 2. These dogs are trotting (or running at a leisurely pace) on a grassy area. 3. One of the three dogs has a tennis ball in its possession. Now, let us consider the statement \\"The dogs are enjoying the park.\\" This statement provides us with additional context, suggesting that: 1. The described events are taking place in a park. 2. The dogs are experiencing enjoyment or are engaged in pleasurable activities within the park. Taking this information into account, we can reasonably infer that the original premise could hold true in light of the second statement. Parks typically provide green, grassy spaces where dogs can roam freely, so it would not be unusual to find dogs running on stretches of grass in parks. In fact, park settings often encourage dogs to engage in activities like running, fetching, and playing with tennis balls. Furthermore, the presence of a tennis ball, which is a common dog toy, and the fact that the dogs are trotting around the park could both support the idea that the dogs are enjoying their time in this area. The dogs' activities align well with typical canine behaviors and preferences, so it seems plausible that both the premise and the statement could be accurate. However, it is important to reiterate that the original premise does not inherently rely on the truth of the second statement. Nonetheless, based on the information gathered from both statements and given the context established by the park setting and the dogs' activities, it is reasonable to assume that the presented premise is true or at least highly likely to be true when considering the statement \\"The dogs are enjoying the park.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Useless: The turbine outside the Welsh government office in Aberystwyth is to be scrapped after only producing £5 of electricity a month. A wind turbine which cost the taxpayer almost £50,000 but generated just £5 of electricity a month is to be scrapped. Installed outside an office of the Welsh government, the turbine was part of its plan to become more environmentally friendly. Despite the fact that civil servants were warned the 60ft turbine was being placed a location that was too sheltered and would not experience enough wind, they went ahead and paid £48,000 for it. Last year it was revealed that the turbine was producing an average of just 33 kilowatts of energy a month – the equivalent of £5.28 worth of electricity. Based on those figures, the turbine would need to stand for 757 years before the cost of it was offset by the electricity it produced. Yesterday it emerged that the turbine is to be removed because the manufacturer has gone into liquidation. Ministers said they do not have anyone else to maintain it. A spokesman for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It beggars belief that tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money was squandered on a scheme with such a minuscule return.’ The turbine manufacturers, Quiet Revolution, warned civil servants that their office in Aberystwyth, West Wales, was the wrong place for the turbine before it was erected in 2009. Instead of putting it close to the coastline, they insisted on sitting it in a valley, two miles from blustery Cardigan Bay. Turbine expert Paul Burrell said: ‘It’s very important with any wind turbine to ensure they have unobstructed access to wind from all directions. ‘Unfortunately, the Welsh government’s turbine was located in a valley two miles from the sea. It was also located next to tall buildings, so even if there was a strong wind it was displaced by the time it reached the turbine.’ The wind turbine’s performance was monitored from January 2012 until July 2013 and it was found to generate 33 kilowatts per month. Using the current average price of electricity of 16p per kilowatt, that means it made £5.28 of electricity a month. The turbine broke down in January and the manufacturer went into administration soon after that. A Welsh government spokesman said the turbine stopped working when the brakes were ‘locked on’. He said: ‘Our contractor was in discussion with Quiet Revolution until March to try and resolve the fault, when they received an email [to say] that the company had gone into administration. ‘They have been unable to progress the matter with the administrator and, as such, the wind turbine has remained out of use. ‘As the prospects of finding a company able to take on the maintenance and repair are limited, we are considering options for its removal.’ Not enough power: Last year it was revealed that the turbine was producing an average of just 33 kilowatts of energy a month. Based on the figures, it would have needed to stand for 757 years before cost was offset. Experts are divided over the efficiency of wind turbines and their capacity to generate electricity. Lucrative subsidies – paid for by taxpayers in the form of higher energy bills – are offered to landowners who erect turbines on their property by the Government, which sees building new wind farms as key to meeting tough European carbon emission targets. But opponents say the targets, which aim to reduce carbon dioxide by 80 per cent by 2020, are unrealistic and wind turbines will never be an efficient source of electricity for the National Grid.

CONTEXT: Disputa sobre el nombre del idioma macedonio Adicionalmente a las disputas sobre la existencia de una nación macedonia, también se ha debatido la existencia de un idioma macedonio. Los lingüistas búlgaros y griegos han insistido que el idioma macedonio no es más que un dialecto derivado del búlgaro debido a su afinidad lingüística, su surgimiento tardío como un idioma independiente y la motivación política que existió tras su promoción a mediados del siglo XX. Sin embargo, pese a las similitudes existentes entre el idioma macedonio y los demás idiomas eslavos meridionales se ha argumentado que el idioma macedonio es diferente a los demás idiomas eslavos. Los lingüistas macedonios enfatizan que aunque el idioma macedonio fue normalizado y reconocido en 1944, este idioma macedonio históricamente tiene su origen en el antiguo eslavo eclesiástico desarrollado por los santos Cirilo y Metodio en el siglo IX.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. They are asking about two separate functions within Microsoft Word. I'll go ahead and explain each one in detail. 1. How do I insert a sigma symbol into a Word document? The sigma symbol (Σ or σ) is a mathematical symbol that represents the sum of a series of numbers in mathematics. To insert the sigma symbol into a Word document, follow the steps below: Step 1: Open your Word document. Step 2: Navigate to the location within the document where you desire to insert the symbol. Step 3: There are two main methods to do this. Method A: Insert Tab - Click on the \\"Insert\\" tab from the menu at the top of Word. - In the \\"Symbols\\" group, click on \\"Symbol\\" and then choose \\"More Symbols\\". This will open the Symbol dialog box. - In the Symbol dialog box, select \\"Greek and Coptic\\" from the \\"Subset\\" dropdown. This should display the Greek alphabet, including the sigma symbol. - Choose either the upper case Σ or the lower case σ depending on your need and click on the \\"Insert\\" button. Method B: Using the Character Code - Another method to add the sigma symbol in Word is by using its character code which is 03A3 for caps lock sigma i.e., Σ and 03C3 for the lowercase sigma i.e., σ. - Press and hold the 'Alt' key on your keyboard, then type 03A3 or 03C3 (depending on which you need) using the numeric keypad, then release the 'Alt' key. This will instantly insert the sigma symbol wherever your cursor is. 2. How can I insert a line break in MS Word? A line break allows you to start typing on a new line without starting a new paragraph and can be useful when you want to start a new line without changing the spacing. Here are the steps to insert a line break. Step 1: Open up the Word document where you want to insert the line break. Step 2: Navigate to the specific location within your document where you want to insert the line break. Step 3: Position your cursor at the point where you want the line to break. Step 4: On your keyboard, use the shortcut key combination 'Shift + Enter'. This will start a new line without starting a new paragraph. Step 5: It's important to note that line breaks are less spacing than paragraph breaks and don't create a first-line indent usually associated with new paragraphs. Thus, the two tasks, while related to the editing and formatting of a Word document, inquire about different functionalities within the Microsoft Word program. The first is about inserting a special symbol and the second is about formatting text layout."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, answer the following question. What do people with sun damaged skin reading this article probably think of facial creams? Choose your answer from: A). they probably think it will make their skin improve its condition B). not enough information C). they probably think it is worthless D). they probably don't care about it Answer:","completion":"A). they probably think it will make their skin improve its condition"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Colin returns for his drugs and, with Angela, goes into the basement to find them. The pair find a hidden door, and Angela remarks that the house is full of hidden rooms, including a tunnel that leads to the next estate over. They enter the room and find six skeletons. Angela surmises that the skeletons are the remains of the missing party guests of Evangeline Broussard. One of the skeletons bites Angela's hand, which causes her to feel woozy. Colin attempts to leave the house, only to discover that the gate is locked and can't be opened. While everyone plans to wait the night out, Suzanne details how Evangeline supposedly practiced black magic in the hopes that she would attract the attention of Louis, only to have that magic...

Plot title: 88 Minutes Movie plot: Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Jack Gramm (Al Pacino) testifies at the trial of suspected serial murderer Jon Forster (Neal McDonough), dubbed \\"The Seattle Slayer\\" by police. Gramm's testimony and expert psychiatric opinion are crucial to help convict Forster of the attempted killing of Janie Cates and the murder of Joanie Cates, who was drugged, hanged upside down, and killed after the killer broke into her home. After receiving his conviction by the jury, Forster taunts Gramm, saying \\"Tick-tock, Doc.\\" Nine years later, as Forster's execution date approaches, several similar torture murders with very similar circumstances occur. Gramm is questioned by a lawyer from the Attorney General's office as well as FBI Special Agent Frank Parks (William Forsythe) about his connection to the latest victim, Dale Morris, a former psychology student of Gramm's with whom he was at a party the night before, just hours before her death. On the way to his class, Gramm receives a phone call from someone using software to distort their voice, threatening he has 88 minutes to live. He later reports the call to his secretary Shelly (Amy Brenneman) and has her put together a risk assessment profile of potential perpetrators. Gramm receives another threatening phone call while teaching and becomes suspicious of his students, particularly Mike Stempt (Benjamin McKenzie). The Dean of students, Carol Johnson (Deborah Kara Unger), interrupts the class to evacuate the building due to a bomb threat called in. As he evacuates the lecture hall, Gramm finds a written threat on the overhead projector in the classroom as well as on his car, which has been vandalized in the parking garage. Gramm then is met by his teaching assistant Kim Cummings (Alicia Witt) who offers to help him find the person that's been targeting him.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: - You breathe air in - Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process involves exhaling carbon dioxide out of the lungs and into the atmosphere. After blood has carried carbon dioxide back to the lungs, it must be removed from the body to maintain proper balance and prevent toxic buildup. Here is a detailed description of this process: 1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is carried by the blood back to the lungs. It is carried in three main forms: as dissolved gas, bound to hemoglobin, or as bicarbonate ions. The majority of the CO2 (about 70%) is transported as bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) to maintain the blood's pH level, while approximately 20% is bound to hemoglobin and around 10% is dissolved in plasma. 2. The CO2-rich blood arrives back at the lungs through the pulmonary arteries, which branch off into capillaries surrounding the alveoli. 3. Inside these capillaries, carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood and into the alveoli due to the concentration gradient. This process is facilitated because the levels of CO2 are higher in the blood than in the alveoli. At the same time, oxygen (O2) diffuses from the alveoli into the blood, attaching to hemoglobin molecules. 4. As CO2 accumulates in the alveoli, it is mixed with the residual air present after the previous breath. 5. Once the gas exchange is complete, the process of exhalation begins. The diaphragm, which is a dome-shaped muscle under the lungs, relaxes and moves upward, reducing the volume of the thoracic cavity. Also, the intercostal muscles, which are between the ribs, relax and move inward. This causes a decrease in lung volume and an increase in pressure within the lungs. 6. Due to this increase in pressure, air containing the carbon dioxide is forced out of the lungs, through the bronchioles, bronchial tubes, and trachea. Then, it reaches the larynx and passes through the vocal folds, and finally exits the body through the nostrils and mouth during exhalation. 7. The cycle of inhalation and exhalation, also known as ventilation, continues as long as an individual is breathing, allowing for a continuous exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. This ensures that the body maintains a proper balance of gases and supports essential life functions. In conclusion, the last step of the breathing process is exhaling carbon dioxide out of the lungs and into the atmosphere. This is crucial for maintaining the body's acid-base balance, ensuring proper cellular functions, and preventing the buildup of toxic levels of carbon dioxide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mechanical energy is a combination of kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (energy due to position or stored energy). Other examples of mechanical energy include: 1. A roller coaster at the top of a hill has potential energy due to its position. As it descends, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, generating speed and motion. 2. A compressed spring has potential energy stored in it. When it's released, the spring converts potential energy into kinetic energy, causing the spring to move or push other objects. 3. A book on a shelf has potential energy due to its position relative to the ground. If the book falls, it converts potential energy to kinetic energy as it moves towards the ground. 4. A pendulum in a clock has potential energy when it is at the highest points in its swing. As it moves towards the bottom of its arc, potential energy converts into kinetic energy and vice versa. Energy can be stored using position mainly through gravitational potential energy (height relative to the ground or another object) and elastic potential energy (such as a compressed spring or a stretched rubber band). These are examples of potential energy that, when released, can be converted into kinetic energy, creating motion and contributing to the total mechanical energy of an object."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859), and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861).In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore.

Please answer the following question: Marion county used coal and oil to produce electricity, while James county used nuclear energy for its electricity production. Both counties had a flourishing economy. Which county used more nuclear fission to produce energy? Answer:","completion":"James County used more nuclear fission to produce energy as compared to Marion County. While both counties had flourishing economies, their methods of electricity production differed significantly. Marion County relied on fossil fuels, specifically coal and oil, for its energy needs, while James County turned to nuclear energy as its primary source of electricity production. Nuclear fission is a process that occurs when the nucleus of an atom is split into two smaller nuclei, resulting in the release of a tremendous amount of energy. This energy can then be harnessed to generate electricity. In a nuclear power plant, controlled nuclear fission is used to heat water, producing steam that drives turbines and generates electricity. As James County used nuclear energy for its electricity production, it is safe to conclude that it employed nuclear fission as the primary method for creating energy. On the other hand, Marion County relied on coal and oil to produce electricity. Both coal and oil are fossil fuels, which are formed from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago and have undergone geological processes over time to become sources of highly concentrated energy. When these fuels are burned, they release energy in the form of heat. In power plants, this heat is used to boil water, generating steam that drives turbines, which then produce electricity. Thus, considering that Marion County utilized coal and oil as its primary energy sources, it did not require the use of nuclear fission as a method for electricity production. Therefore, it is clear that James County used more nuclear fission to generate energy compared to Marion County, as nuclear fission was the core process in its electricity production system."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Context: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings.

Orville invites Dino to stay with him and wife Zelda, but becomes concerned when he learns the singer needs to have sex every night to avoid awakening with a headache. Anxious to accommodate Dino but safeguard his marriage, Orville provokes an argument with his wife that leads to Zelda fleeing in tears. He and Barney then arrange for Polly the Pistol, a waitress and prostitute at a saloon on the edge of town called the Belly Button, to pose as Orville's wife and satisfy Dino.

Amanda Williams. PUBLISHED:. 05:33 EST, 24 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 11:38 EST, 24 February 2013. Former heavyweight world champion Herbie Hide has allegedly offered to help throw a world title fight for £1million. Former heavyweight world champion Herbie Hide has allegedly offered to help throw a world title fight for £1million, it was revealed today. Video footage of Hide - nicknamed the destroyer - apparently boasting about being able to fix boxing bouts has been published by the Sun on Sunday. They also allege that Hide offered to arrange for cocaine to be bought. Hide reportedly said: 'Whoever, which round you want, whatever you want as long as you put the money. 'I can guarantee one thing, you can get whoever is the favourite, you can get them to step down for a million pounds. 'You need a big name on good record — yeah, like myself!' The twice-crowned champion talked about pulling another unwitting top boxer into the scam. He described boxing as not about 'who is best' but instead called it a 'business'. The 41-year-old British heavyweight also arranged for cocaine to be delivered to undercover reporters for £100 a gram, the paper claims. The cocaine dealer claimed that Hide gave out the number of the reporters - posing as businessmen who were interested in organising exhibition bouts in the Middle East - to arrange a deal. Police have confirmed they are investigating drug allegations. Hide, nicknamed the Dancing Destroyer, reportedly lives in a £1.5million home in Norwich — the scene of tragedy last year when a 25-year-old was stabbed to death at a party. Tafadzwa Khan - known as Taffy - was knifed up to three times in the chest when fighting broke out at the sportsman’s £1.5million mansion. Mr Hide was not at the house at the time. Hide tried to persuade reporters to bankroll his comeback. Professional competitive bouts are officially recorded on a boxer’s record - allowing millions be punted on the outcome. Hide is currently not licensed to fight, but he claimed he could easily obtain permission. He said he would 'fight a bum' just to get warmed up. Video footage of Hide - nicknamed the destroyer - apparently boasting about being able to fix boxing bouts while they also allege that Hide offered to arrange cocaine has been published by the Sun on Sunday. Hide suggested the name of another big name fighter with an impressive winning record to take part in the championship bout - claiming 'money speaks'. However, there is no suggestion that the other boxer has ever been involved in match-fixing. Hide explained how his inside knowledge could help fix betting on fights by staging press conferences and sparring sessions held before them. These sessions are seen as key indicators of how fighters are likely to perform. They have a large impact on betting odds. Hide attempted to justify the £1million bout fixing fee he was demanding by saying: 'Money speaks and that’s where you can get people that will do it.' He said one boxer accepted a bung mid-fight to feign injury so his opponent would stay undefeated but warned reporters that he was 'telling them secrets'. After his heavyweight success Hide stepped down to cruiserweight and has won 14 successive fights and remains unbeaten at that weight. There is no suggestion that any of his previous fights have been rigged. A Norfolk Constabulary spokesman said: 'We have on Saturday 23 February, been handed information in the form of two short sections of video concerning alleged drug activity. 'The material appears to relate to an incident on 31 January 2013. 'The Police are examining this and working with the provider of the information to investigate the full circumstances.

Movie title: The Outsiders Context: The story begins with Ponyboy Curtis (Howell) writing a school report about his recent experiences growing up in 1965 Tulsa, Oklahoma. His friends, the Greasers, are a gang of tough, low-income middle-class teens. The gang includes 14-year-old Ponyboy and his two older brothers, Sodapop (Lowe) and Darrell \\"Darry\\" (Swayze), as well as Johnny (Macchio), Dallas \\"Dally\\" Winston (Dillon), Two-Bit Matthews (Estevez), and Steve Randle (Cruise). Their long-term rivalry is with the Socs, a gang of wealthier kids from the other side of town. Two Socs, Bob Sheldon (Garrett) and Randy Anderson (Dalton), confront Johnny, Ponyboy, and Two-Bit, who are strolling with and talking to the Socs' girlfriends, Cherry (Lane) and Marcia (Meyrink), after watching a movie at a drive-in theater. The girls defuse the situation by going back with the Socs. Ponyboy and Johnny fall asleep in the parking lot where Ponyboy dreams of his deceased parents. Awakened by Johnny, he worriedly heads home fearing Darrel's frustration. As he fears, Darrel is angry with him for coming home late. Sodapop draws himself into the argument, resulting in Darrel hitting Ponyboy. Emotionally hurt by Darrel's assault, Ponyboy flees his home and finds Johnny. The two boys head to the park. Ponyboy and Johnny are soon attacked in the park by Bob, Randy, and three other Socs. They kick Johnny to the ground and grab Ponyboy and attempt to drown him by dunking him in the park fountain, making him temporarily unconscious. When they attempt to drown Ponyboy, Johnny pulls out his switchblade and stabs Bob to death, while the other Socs quickly flee to the police. After regaining consciousness and learning what has happened, Ponyboy goes with Johnny in search of Dally's help. On Dally's advice, and the fact that murderers in Oklahoma will be executed on the electric chair, Ponyboy and Johnny flee on a cargo train, and hide out in an abandoned church on Jay Mountain in Windrixville.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bob Sheldon's death has sparked a rumble in the movie \\"The Outsiders.\\" To provide more context, during the movie, tension grows between two rival gangs, the Greasers and the Socs. In a pivotal scene, Bob Sheldon, a member of the Socs, and his friends attack Ponyboy and Johnny, two members of the Greasers, in a park. Bob and Randy, another Soc, have confronted Johnny and Ponyboy earlier in the movie when they see them talking to their girlfriends, Cherry and Marcia. In the park, the Socs attempt to drown Ponyboy in a fountain, which causes Johnny to act in self-defense by pulling out his switchblade and stabbing Bob, ultimately leading to his death. This event fuels the rivalry between the two gangs, and tensions quickly escalate, ultimately culminating in a rumble. The Greasers and the Socs face off in a violent fight triggered by the death of Bob, which dramatically changes the lives of the characters involved and pushes the story forward. The rumble brings many of the film's conflicts and themes to a head, as it showcases the division between the two social classes and their fierce antagonism – a situation that Bob's death has only exacerbated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

In this case, the DeWalt light stopped working after only an hour of use and produced an unpleasant acrid smell. These issues directly relate to the product's performance and indicate that it did not meet the reviewer's expectations. 2. The reviewer returned the product: Customers generally return products when they are not happy with their purchase or if the product is faulty. In this case, the reviewer returned the DeWalt light, further emphasizing their dissatisfaction with its performance. 3. The reviewer hasn't tried the product again: Although the reviewer acknowledges that the problem might be limited to a defective unit and not a design flaw, they have not tried the product again, which implies that they have lost confidence in the product.

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. In this task, you are presented with a term, a description of the term, and an expected answer ('yes' or 'no'). You should write a yes-no question about the given term such that the answer is the one provided to you (i.e., If the answer is \\"No\\", you should ask a question that its answer would be \\"No\\", and if the answer is \\"Yes\\", you should ask a question that its answer is \\"Yes\\". ). The question should have a definitive answer (as opposed to ambiguous or subjective questions, e.g., Is Batman a good movie?). Create a question such that its answer can not be found easily on a single web page (e.g., mentioned in a Wikipedia page). This can be accomplished if answering the question requires more than one fact (facts = statements that can be found on a Wikipedia page or Google). For example, answering the question 'did Aristotle use a laptop?', one needs the know about the invention of the laptop and the death of Aristotle.

Usage: Sample Question - \\"Is Shiva a Greek god?\\" This question is related to the term \\"Shiva\\" and requires a \\"No\\" answer, as provided in the expected answer. Part #3: Ensure the question has a definitive answer, avoiding ambiguity or subjectivity. Usage: Our sample question, \\"Is Shiva a Greek god?\\", has a definitive answer (No) as Shiva belongs to Hinduism, not Greek mythology. It is not ambiguous or subjective. Part #4: Make the question challenging so the answer cannot be found easily on a single webpage. Usage: Sample Question - \\"Is there a temple dedicated to Shiva built in a European country before 1800?\\" This question requires knowledge of Shiva temples and their construction dates in Europe, which is not easily found on a single webpage. The answer is \\"No\\" as a Shiva temple in a European country before 1800 is unlikely, given the time period and differing religious beliefs. Part #5: Avoid trivial comparisons and direct details from the given description. Usage: Our sample question, \\"Is there a temple dedicated to Shiva built in a European country before 1800?\\", is not a trivial comparison and does not reference any direct details from the given description, making it an appropriate question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After eating and chilling at the restaurant for a bit we headed over to the bar . We got a good spot blocked off and saved an extra 3 chairs for those who did n't make it to dinner . The band started about 10 pm , but prior to that both Matt and I each started out with a \\" boomba \\" a 32 oz beer . Answer the following question: Why did they save extra chairs ?","completion":"The group of friends decided to save extra chairs for several reasons, which can be deduced from the provided information. Here is a detailed explanation of the possible reasons for their decision: 1. Anticipation of more guests: Firstly, the group seems to have anticipated that more people might join them later in the evening. While they have already gathered a considerable group consisting of Colleen, Tim, Nik, Stone, MC, Matt, and themselves, it is evident that they were either expecting more friends or thought that some might come directly to the bar without attending dinner at Marinelli's. By saving extra chairs, they wanted to ensure that their friends would have a comfortable spot to sit and enjoy the live music that was scheduled to start at 10 PM. 2. Social setting: Going out to a bar is usually considered a social event where people mingle, catch up with old friends, and meet new people. By saving extra chairs, the group is ensuring that they have enough space to accommodate any new acquaintances they might make during their time at the bar. This creates an open and inviting atmosphere that allows their friend circle to potentially expand. 3. Convenience: In crowded places like bars, finding a proper seating arrangement can sometimes be challenging due to limited space or high demand, especially when there is live music involved. By blocking off a good spot and saving extra chairs, the group ensured their companions would have a comfortable place to gather and enjoy the evening without having to search for seating amid the crowd. 4. Presence for latecomers: It is also possible that some of the group members who attended dinner might have left the gathering temporarily, perhaps to use the restroom or to take a phone call. By reserving extra chairs, the group guaranteed that their friends would have a place to return to without having to worry about losing their spot. Overall, the group decided to save extra chairs at the bar to provide comfort and convenience for their friends, create a welcoming atmosphere for new acquaintances, and accommodate any latecomers or temporary departures from the gathering. They were anticipating a fun and social evening, and this gesture of reserving extra chairs demonstrated their consideration and foresight for the enjoyment of their friends and potential new connections."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The San Pablo Reservoir is an open cut terminal water storage reservoir owned and operated by the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). It is located in the valley of San Pablo Creek, north of Orinda, California and south of El Sobrante and Richmond, east of the Berkeley Hills between San Pablo Ridge and Sobrante Ridge. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The San Pablo Reservoir is in San Pablo Creek","completion":"Yes, the next sentence does follow the provided text given that the San Pablo Reservoir is stated to be located in the valley of San Pablo Creek. This detail suggests the reservoir's setting is within or adjacent to the riverbed, or it could be directly supplied by San Pablo Creek. The San Pablo Reservoir, being a terminal water storage reservoir, means it is the final storage place where water can be held before it is treated and supplied to consumers. In this context, it can be inferred that the creek plays a vital role in feeding water into the reservoir. Given its location and operation by the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD), the reservoir forms a crucial part of the local water supply infrastructure. Being \\"in\\" San Pablo Creek doesn't necessarily imply that the reservoir is within the creek itself, as in a narrower running body of water. In fact, it could indicate that the reservoir is situated within the wider geographical context of the creek's valley or watershed. It is often common for manmade reservoirs to be situated within or close to a natural water source like a creek or river in order to harness the flow of water for resources. These sources not only help to refill the reservoir, but also play a big role in maintaining the ecological balance of the region. Therefore, it's accurate to conclude that, as per the preceding text, the San Pablo Reservoir is indeed \\"in\\" San Pablo Creek. That said, it would be ideal for the context to define what is meant by \\"in\\" – whether this reference strictly relates to geographical location, or it's more about how the water system of the reservoir is intricately connected and dependent on the creek."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided and considering the fact that hair is a fiber found only in mammals and hair can turn auburn red, the best answer among the options given would be: \\"Something that can be auburn.\\" This answer best addresses the question because it specifically mentions a characteristic unique to hair, which is a fiber exclusive to mammals. Hair serves various functions in mammals, such as providing insulation, protecting the skin, and aiding in the sense of touch. Auburn is a color seen in hair, often describing a reddish-brown shade. Since none of the other answer choices mention the hair fiber's unique color directly, this option stands out as the most fitting. To provide a brief analysis of the other answer choices: - \\"They have thick fur\\": While many mammals have thick fur, this does not answer the question about a specific type of fiber found only in mammals. - \\"Something that is self-aware\\": This answer option is not applicable as it does not relate to hair or a fiber found in mammals. - \\"with their fur\\": This answer choice is unclear and does not directly address the question about a fiber exclusive to mammals. - \\"To keep their body heat\\": While insulation and retaining body heat can be a function of hair, this answer does not identify the actual fiber itself. - \\"it helps plants in growing\\": This choice is not relevant to a fiber found in mammals and is unrelated to hair. - \\"it keeps an organism warm\\": Similar to the \\"To keep their body heat\\" option, this answer refers to a function of hair rather than identifying the particular fiber. - \\"Something that comes in a bundle of fibers\\": This answer is too vague and does not specify the fiber unique to mammals i.e., hair. In conclusion, based on the question and options given, the best answer choice would be \\"Something that can be auburn\\" because it directly addresses the unique characteristic of hair, a fiber found only in mammals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","completion":"In this context, the request addressed to the Commission to promote the creation of urban administrators and to establish an Erasmus exchange program for elected representatives at local and regional level is significant. The importance of promoting the creation of urban administrators lies in the need to efficiently manage urban centers, face the various challenges brought by urbanization, and ensure sustainable development for the benefit of citizens. Urban administrators can play a crucial role in addressing issues such as housing, transportation, social cohesion, environmental protection, and public services. By creating and supporting an adequate structure for urban administrators, the Commission can not only improve the quality of life for citizens but also foster European integration and encourage best practices among municipalities and regions. As for the idea of establishing an Erasmus exchange program for elected representatives at local and regional levels, this proposal essentially aims to strengthen cooperation, knowledge sharing, and networking among local and regional authorities across Europe. The Erasmus program is widely recognized for its success in increasing cross-border collaboration in the field of education. By extending its scope to include elected representatives and local and regional decision-makers, the program could greatly contribute to fostering cooperation, capacity building, and multi-level governance throughout the European Union. Such an exchange program would allow elected representatives to learn from their peers, to exchange best practices, and to deepen their understanding of the different approaches to policy-making and administration in various regions and cities across Europe. This would ultimately contribute to the development of more effective policies and strategies for local and regional administrations, benefitting the citizens they serve. Moreover, the program could stimulate innovation and creativity among local and regional authorities, bridging the gap between different regions and reinforcing European cohesion. Financial support for these exchanges should ensure equal access for representatives from all regions, regardless of their economic development, and promote territorial balance. In conclusion, the request to promote urban administrators and establish an Erasmus exchange program for elected representatives at local and regional levels is significant because it aims to improve the management of Europe's urban centers, enhance knowledge sharing and policy-making, and ultimately foster greater European cooperation and cohesion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I can use this background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Now, I have a new situation: John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. Answer this question please: Would test C see higher or lower concentration of the reactants than test D? The answer is:","completion":"Test C would see a lower concentration of the reactants than test D according to Le Châtelier’s principle. This assessment is based on the premise that in test C, John observed a forward reaction. In the context of a chemical equilibrium, a favored forward reaction suggests that the system is trying to offset some form of stress by increasing the production of the product. This process decreases the concentrations of the reactants as they are being used to form the products. On the other hand, in test D, John observed a reverse reaction. When the reverse reaction is favoured, it implies that the system is responding to a different stressor. In order to minimize this stress, the system shifts to convert more of the products back into the reactants, thus increasing the concentration of the reactants. Therefore, considering Le Châtelier’s principle and the observations made by John in tests C and D, it can be inferred that the concentration of reactants would be lower in test C (where the forward reaction is favored) than in test D (where the reverse reaction is favored). This is because in test C the reactants are being used up to form more products, whilst in test D the products are being consumed to regenerate the reactants, thereby increasing their concentration. However, it's worth noting that several factors could potentially influence the shift in equilibrium position, including the exact nature of the stressors, the specific characteristics of the chemical system in question, and the environmental conditions such as temperature and pressure, among others. Nonetheless, the basic principles of chemical equilibrium as detailed by Le Châtelier provide a useful framework for understanding and predicting the system's response to changes or stresses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Sugababes are a British girl group formed in 1998 by Siobhan Donaghy, Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan. Their debut album, One Touch, was released in the UK through London Records on 27 November 2000. The album achieved moderate success, peaking at number 26 in April 2001 and eventually being certified Gold. In 2001, Donaghy departed the group amid rumours of a rift with Buchanan and the group were dropped by their record label. The Sugababes were formed in 1998 by All Saints manager Ron Tom. Siobhan Donaghy and Mutya Buena, both aged just 13, had been signed as solo artists, but decided to work together after performing at the same showcase. While working in the studio, Buena invited her best friend Keisha Buchanan to watch them. Manager Tom decided the three girls were to be a trio, likening their different appearances to the United Colors of Benetton campaign. Originally dubbed the Sugababies, the group's name was tweaked to Sugababes when they were signed by London Records to give the group a more mature image. The group's debut single, \\"Overload\\", peaked at number 6 on the UK Singles Chart in 2000 and was nominated for a BRIT Award for Best Single. The group co-wrote most of the tracks on debut album One Touch with the help of All Saints producer Cameron McVey. One Touch peaked at number 26 on the UK Albums Chart. The album produced three more top 40 hits--\\"New Year\\", \\"Run for Cover\\" and \\"Soul Sound\\". The sales of One Touch did not meet London Records' expectations, and they dropped the group in 2001. It was later certified gold by the BPI and had sold 220,000 copies in the UK by 2008 according to Music Week. During a Japanese promotional tour in August 2001, Donaghy left the group. She stated initially that she wanted to pursue a fashion career, but was eventually diagnosed with clinical depression amid reports of in-fighting amongst the group's members. Donaghy later stated that she was forced out of the group by Buchanan and called Buchanan the \\"first bully\\" in her life. Former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range was announced as Donaghy's replacement. Having already started work on a second album with new member Range, the trio looked for a new record label, eventually signing to Island Records. Their first single on the new label, \\"Freak like Me\\" scored the group their first UK number 1 single. Follow-up single \\"Round Round\\" also debuted on top of the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number 2 in Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand. Both singles were certified silver by the BPI. On the back of the success of the singles, the group's second album, Angels with Dirty Faces, debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart and was later certified triple platinum, selling almost a million copies in the UK alone. It is to date their highest-selling album. In the UK, the third single from the album, a ballad titled \\"Stronger\\", gained the girls their third consecutive top ten hit in their native country. The track was released as a double-A side with \\"Angels with Dirty Faces\\" in the UK, the latter song chosen as the theme tune to The Powerpuff Girls Movie. A fourth single, the Sting-sampling \\"Shape\\", made the top ten in the Netherlands and Ireland in early 2003. The group's third album, Three, was released in late 2003 and reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart, earning the group a BRIT Award nomination for Best Album. Certified double platinum, it has sold 855,000 copies to date. The album was preceded by lead single \\"Hole in the Head\\", which became the group's third UK number 1 single. It also reached number 2 in Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway, and became the Sugababes' first (and to date only) single to chart in the United States, reaching number 96 on the Billboard Hot 100. Follow-up single \\"Too Lost in You\\" appeared on the soundtrack to the film Love Actually and went top ten in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK. The album's third single, \\"In the Middle\\", was released in 2004 and garnered the group another BRIT Award nomination for Best Single; like its successor, the ballad \\"Caught in a Moment\\", it went to number 8 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2004, the trio sang on the Band Aid 20 remake of \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\", which went to number 1 in the UK in December. Around this time, the group's perceived \\"moodiness\\", alleged backstage catfights, and press junket tantrums were tabloid fodder in Britain. They were surrounded by continuous rumours of in-fighting within the group and constant split reports. Rumours suggested that Buchanan and Buena had bullied Range, although Range herself repeatedly denied such allegations; Buena later admitted that she \\"just didn't talk to her\\" when she first joined. Buchanan claimed there was only one serious fallout between herself and Range during a 2004 gig in Dublin, regarding Britney Spears' \\"Toxic\\". After a hiatus, the Sugababes released their thirteenth single, \\"Push the Button\\" in October 2005. The song debuted at number 1 in the UK and remained in the position for three consecutive weeks. It also peaked at number one in Ireland, Austria and New Zealand, and reached the top three across Europe and in Australia. Certified silver in the UK, it was later nominated at the BRIT Awards for Best Single. Parent album Taller in More Ways became the group's first UK number 1 album. The group was number 1 on the singles, album, airplay and download charts simultaneously, making them the first girl group to achieve such a feat. Taller in More Ways was certified double platinum in the UK. Following an apparent illness that prevented Buena from promoting follow-up single \\"Ugly\\", it was announced on 21 December 2005 that Buena had left the Sugababes. According to an announcement on their official website, Buena's decision was based purely on personal reasons following the birth of her daughter. Amelle Berrabah joined the Sugababes in late December 2005, having been chosen by the group's management to replace Buena. The third single from Taller in More Ways was a re-recorded version of \\"Red Dress\\", which was released in early 2006, and gave the Sugababes their third consecutive top five hit from the album, entering the UK Singles Chart at number 4. Berrabah re-recorded three of the album's twelve tracks and co-wrote a new song with Buchanan and Range named \\"Now You're Gone\\". The tracks appeared on a re-release of Taller in More Ways that reached number 18 on the UK Albums Chart. The fourth and final single from Taller in More Ways was \\"Follow Me Home\\", released only in the UK in June, where it charted at number 32. In mid-2006, the group returned to the studio to record two new tracks for their first greatest hits collection, titled Overloaded: The Singles Collection. The lead single from the compilation, \\"Easy\\" peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst the compilation album, released in November 2006, peaked at number 3. The album, certified platinum by the BPI, has sold 598,000 copies.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the King that a mounted white horse representing him is carved into the chalk hills of Osmington? ? Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What did Moore do instead of using a machine when asked to reproduce The Virgin and Child?, using the article: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing..., what would be the answer ?

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Article: The prefix = st1 /USgovernment has announced plans to list polar bears as a threatened species because of concerns that the ice where they live is melting. But as the BBC's Owen Clegg reports, theUSplans are also important for other reasons. It's estimated that there are no more than twenty-five thousand polar bears living in the wild, and this number could go down by a large amount as the floating ice upon which the bears survive melt away. Now, without admitting the cause of this melt, the US Fish and Wildlife Services are reviewing the bear's living conditions. That action is being taken at all, and marks an important change for the Bush administration; for the first time, it may be forced to acknowledge a link between global warming and its effect on a species. Such a conclusion by an unwilling Bush administration could force far wider changes inWashington's policy towards the environment. This review only came about after a union of environmental groups brought a legal case against the government to take action. Environmentalists, like David Doniger, believe that by calling on the protections of the Endangered Species Act, theUSgovernment may finally be forced to cut back on its sending out greenhouse gases: \\"It is a very important thing today to have the Bush administration notice that global warming is threatening the existence of the polar bear.

The Roots of the Ukraine Crisis To understand the significance of the proposed solution, it's essential to delve into the roots of the Ukraine crisis. For Putin, a major issue stems from the enlargement of NATO, which has been increasingly reaching Russia's borders. With many Eastern European countries becoming part of NATO post-Cold War, Russia's sphere of influence was significantly reduced. This built up a catalog of grievances in Putin's mind, fueling his drive for a more assertive Russian foreign policy. The Post-Soviet Assumptions Following the end of the Cold War, there was an unwritten agreement between Russia and the West about refraining from aggressive political and military activities in the region. However, Putin may see the Ukraine crisis as an opportunity to challenge these assumptions. By actively asserting Russia's position, he hopes to claim a stronger role in the global political landscape and sends a message to the West about his limits of tolerance. Ruling out Ukraine's NATO Membership as a Solution With the increasing tension between Russia and the West, a potential solution, as proposed by Chance, is to rule out Ukraine's membership in NATO. By doing so, it addresses one of Putin's primary grievances. It also alleviates the pressure on Ukraine, providing a neutral ground for both parties to negotiate and find common ground. This approach could reduce the prospects of further Russian intervention and aggression towards Ukraine, ultimately leading to stability in the region. Conclusion The complexity of the Ukraine crisis spans geopolitical, historical, and ideological divides. However, understanding Putin's motivations and grievances can aid in the formulation of potential solutions. Ruling out Ukraine's NATO membership stands as an option that can address Putin's concerns and contribute to stabilizing the situation. While this may not resolve all the underlying issues, it presents an opportunity to open dialogue and reduce hostilities. It is crucial for all parties involved to take active steps in seeking diplomatic solutions that promote peace and security for the sake of the region and the broader international community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So it's important to know which freezer is right for your needs. First, decide if you want an upright or chest model. Uprights are more convenient. Their storage space is more accessible and they take up less floor area. However, chest models are more energy-efficient because less cold air escapes when they are open. If you are buying an upright, you'll have to choose between frostless or manual defrost . Chest freezers are always manual. Frostless freezers automatically defrost at present intervals and remove the water. Manual models must be defrosted by hand every few months or whenever frost pile up to about a quarter of an inch. To help your freezer reach a ripe old age, try to find a spot that's cool, dry, and away fromdrafts . Drafts and heat will raise the freezer's cabinet temperature, which makes it work harder to keep cool. That means wasted energy. That means wasted energy and a shortened life. Dry air is important because highhumidity can cause the freezer to rust outside and frost up inside. With proper care, a freezer can serve you for 15 years or more. Regular cleaning and simple maintenance will help it maintain a zero-degree temperature and keep it smelling fresh and looking almost new. Frostless models requires less care than manual defrost freezers. The inside of a frostless unit should be washed periodically with warm water and baking soda or a mild soap, rinse, and dried. Good habits go a long way toward a freezer that runs efficiently. To get the most from your freezer, check regularly to make sure it's providing a true zero-degree temperature. Keep the freezer at least three-quarters full. The emptier it get, the more energy is wasted. If more than three pounds of food per cubic foot of storage space is added every 24 hours, the resulting high or low temperature can damage the food. According to the passage, choosing the best place for your freezer means _ . A) putting it in an unheated garage if possible B) locating it near a stove if it is a manual-defrosted model C) trying to keep it away from heat, drafts, and humidity D) locating it as close as possible to the kitchen door","completion":"According to the passage, choosing the best place for your freezer means C) trying to keep it away from heat, drafts, and humidity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The collection included a luxurious nine-carat diamond ring valued at £40,000 and four jewel-encrusted designer wristwatches collectively worth £30,000. Also among the 30 lots was a 4.5 carat single-stone ring worth £8,000, a pair of seven-carat diamond earrings worth £15,000 and a bizarre solid gold baby’s dummy worth £500. The haul of jewellery worth £110,000 which was seized from Daniel Harty - the ringleader of a £26million tobacco smuggling operation - is set to go under the hammer later this month. The bizarre solid gold baby's dummy worth £500 was also confiscated from Harty - the mastermind of a criminal gang jailed for smuggling 150 million cigarettes and two tonnes of low quality tobacco into the UK. The gold baby's dummy worth £500, pictured, was one of the many expensive items of jewellery seized from Harty on his arrest in early 2011 under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The items were confiscated from Daniel Harty, the mastermind of a criminal gang jailed for smuggling 150 million cigarettes and two tonnes of low quality tobacco into the UK. Harty created a distribution network around the north of England transporting cigarettes to warehouses, storage yards and farms.

Help as much as you can. Instructions: In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - In computing, the form factor is the specification of a motherboard the dimensions, power supply type, location of mounting holes, number of ports on the back panel, etc. Specifically, in the IBM PC compatible industry, standard form factors ensure that parts are interchangeable across competing vendors and generations of technology, while in enterprise computing, form factors ensure that server modules fit into existing rackmount systems. Traditionally, the most significant specification is for that of the motherboard, which generally dictates the overall size of the case. Small form factors have been developed and implemented. - A home theater PC (HTPC) or media center computer is a convergence device that combines some or all the capabilities of a personal computer with a software application that supports video, photo, audio playback, and sometimes video recording functionality. In recent years, other types of consumer electronics, including gaming systems and dedicated media devices have crossed over to manage video and music content. The term \\"media center\\" also refers to specialized application software designed to run on standard personal computers. - VMware, Inc. is a subsidiary of Dell Technologies, that provides cloud and virtualization software and services, and claims to be the first to successfully virtualize the x86 architecture commercially. Founded in 1998, VMware is based in Palo Alto, California. In 2004, it was acquired by and became a subsidiary of EMC Corporation, then on August 14, 2007, EMC sold 15% of the company in a New York Stock Exchange IPO. The company trades under the symbol VMW. - Openwave (formerly software.com, phone.com, and Libris, Inc) has changed its name to Unwired Planet, and two of its former products have launched as private companies; Openwave Mobility and Openwave Messaging. Openwave is historically significant in its introduction of the Mobile Internet and its expansion into a large successful mobile software supplier in the mobile telecom sector. - A desktop computer is a personal computer designed for regular use at a single location on or near a desk or table due to its size and power requirements. The most common configuration has a case that houses the power supply, motherboard (a printed circuit board with a microprocessor as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, bus, and other electronic components), disk storage (usually one or more hard disk drives, optical disc drives, and in early models a floppy disk drive); a keyboard and mouse for input; and a computer monitor, and, often, a printer for output. The case may be oriented horizontally or vertically and placed either underneath, beside, or on top of a desk. - Twingo Systems is a computer security company based in the United States. Twingo Systems was a leading provider of desktop security solutions for Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). It was founded by French entrepreneurs, Gregoire Gentil (a McKinsey alum) and Reza Malekzadeh (previously one of the first employees at VMware). - A small form factor (SFF) is a computer form factor designed to minimize the volume of a desktop computer. For comparison purposes, the size of an SFF case is usually measured in litres. SFFs are available in a variety of sizes and shapes, including shoeboxes, cubes, and book-sized PCs. Their smaller and often lighter construction has made them popular as home theater PCs and as gaming computers for attending LAN parties. Manufacturers also emphasize the aesthetic and ergonomic design of SFFs since users are more likely to place them on top of a desk or carry them around.

Article: Stephen Hawking was one of the most famous scientists in this century. He was born in 1942. He's a world well-known on space and time. Stephen is researching some very big questions, such as: How did the universe begin? How will it end? Stephen was a student at Oxford University. He studied math and science. Then, at the age of twenty, he became sick. He was so young, but the doctors said to his family, \\"He has only two more years to live.\\" As a matter of fact, the doctors were wrong---- he didn't die. He can't walk now but he uses a wheelchair . He can't feed himself and get in or out of bed himself. But he refused to give in to the condition. He talks with the help of a computer. After Oxford, Stephen went to Cambridge University. Three years later, in 1965, he became a doctor of philosophy . Because of his serious health problems, it was difficult for him to draw diagrams or to write. So he started to think in pictures. With this new way of thinking, he became one of the most famous scientists in the world. In 1991, he met the Pope in Rome. They talked about his ideas. Then in 1998, he wrote his first important book, A Brief History of Time. It sold more than 5.5 million copies in 33 different languages. He was once invited to China, he impressed us with his self-confidence, humorous and witty conversation. Question: How old was Stephen when he became a doctor of philosophy?

The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex. Delos's guests pay 1,000 a day for the experience.Peter Martin (Benjamin) a first-timer and his friend John Blane (Brolin), who has visited previously, come to the WesternWorld zone, where one of the main attractions is the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner), a robot programmed to start duels.

The guns issued to the guests also have temperature sensors that prevent them from firing at each other or anything else living but allow them to 'kill' the room-temperature androids.Gradually, the technicians running Delos begin to notice problems with the androids.

Summarize this article: Aquarium pets are showing up in some unlikely places, and that’s bad news for native species Gigantic goldfish, like this one held by University of Nevada-Reno researcher Christine Ngai, have been found in the waters of Lake Tahoe. Image: Heather Segale A new kind of lake monster has been found, in the depths of Lake Tahoe: gigantic goldfish. Researchers trawling the lake for invasive fish species scooped up a goldfish that was nearly 1.5 feet long and 4.2 pounds. \\"During these surveys, we've found a nice corner where there's about 15 other goldfish,\\" environmental scientist Sudeep Chandra of the University of Nevada, Reno, told LiveScience. \\"It's an indication that they were schooling and spawning.\\" The arrival of the fish, which were probably dumped there by aquarium owners, has Chandra worried — goldfish are an invasive species that could interfere with Lake Tahoe's ecosystem. It's unclear whether the giant fish were introduced as fully grown adults, or while they were still small, Chandra said. But even a small creature can have a big impact, if there are enough of them. The goldfish are just one of several species of invasive warm-water fishes in Lake Tahoe. \\"The invasion is resulting in the consumption of native species,\\" Chandra said. What's more, the invasive fish excrete nutrients that cause algal blooms, which threaten to muddy Tahoe's clear waters. [Photos: Giant Goldfish & Other Freaky Fish] Fish out of water Aquarium dumping has become a common practice in the United States and elsewhere, and it's taking a toll on native wildlife. A recent reporton California's aquarium trade found that fish owners and importers are introducing hardy, nonnative aquatic species to California waters. \\"Globally, the aquarium trade has contributed a third of the world's worst aquatic and invasive species,\\" Williams, who was lead author of the report, told OurAmazingPlanet, a sister site of LiveScience, in January. While the exact number of aquarium owners dumping fish is unknown, scientists know the practice is occurring because these species could not have ended up in these waters naturally. Between 20 percent and 69 percent of fish keepers surveyed in Texas admitted to dumping, according to Williams. Other ways that invasive species find their way into natural ecosystems include aquaculture, live seafood, live bait, and fishing and recreation vessels. More than 11 million nonnative marine organisms representing at least 102 species arrive at ports in San Francisco and Los Angeles alone, Williams has found. The invaders include tropical fish, seaweed and snails. One of the nastiest is a deadly type of seaweed known as Caulerpa. A type of algae that produces toxic compounds that kill off fish, Caulerpa was eradicated in 2000 (at great expense) from lagoons in Southern California. Aquarium owners should be more careful when disposing of unwanted fish and other animals, Williams cautioned. \\"It's pretty simple: Don't dump your fish,\\" she said. Instead, she suggests calling the pet shop that sold the fish or your state department of fish and wildlife. (Euthanasia is another option, but simply flushing fish down the toilet can be problematic — for the fish and for your plumbing.) So why do people dump fish? Studies of dumping have shown that size and aggressiveness of the fish are two main factors, Williams said. The largest pet goldfish, according to the BBC, was a fish named Goldie that was 15 inches (38 cm) long and weighed more than 2 pounds (0.9 kg). ||||| The highly invasive lionfish is easily available through aquarium and internet sales and represents a potential threat for California waters. CREDIT: Christian Mehlfuehrer/UC Davis View full size image In the film \\"Finding Nemo,\\" a plucky clownfish escapes an aquarium tank thanks to some sage advice: \\"All drains lead to the ocean.\\" But in real life, flushing Nemo wouldn't end happily. Aquarium species are some of the hardiest fish and plants in the world, and tank owners and importers who dump unwanted marine life are introducing tough, non-native species to California waters, says a new report on the state's aquarium trade. \\"Globally, the aquarium trade has contributed a third of the world's worst aquatic and invasive species,\\" said Sue Williams, lead author of the report and an evolution and ecology professor at the University of California, Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory. That includes both marine and freshwater species, she said. In California, 13 species found only in dentist's offices or other fish tanks have escaped to the state's marine waters, presumably due to release by aquarium owners or importers. \\"We have no data on how many aquarists dump their organisms into natural waters, we only know that they do so because these are species that could only come through the aquarium trade,\\" Williams told OurAmazingPlanet. A survey of aquarists (people who keep fish) in Texas, cited in the UC Davis report, found 20 to 69 percent of them admitted dumping, she said. The report is one of six that the UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory prepared for the state, each exploring a different vector, or pathway, through which invasive species can enter California ocean waters. The other pathways include aquaculture, live seafood, live bait, fishing vessels and recreation vessels. Every year, San Francisco and Los Angeles ports see more than 11 million non-native, ornamental marine individuals — such as tropical fish, seaweed and snails — bound for aquariums, representing at least 102 species, Williams and her colleagues discovered. [Image Gallery: Freaky Fish] One of the worst introduced species is a killer algae. Though actually a type of seaweed, the species Caulerpaearned its nickname when it infected two lagoons in Southern California in 2000, costing more than 6 million to eradicate. Though most imported marine life comes from Indonesia and the Philippines, where ocean temperatures are warm, the report found 34 species could survive in California's chilly bays. \\"[Aquarium species] are highly likely to survive in the wild, because they have to be so tough to survive the trade,\\" Williams said. Some can even survive a trip down the toilet, she said. One potential invader is the lionfish, a venomous predator that gulps down smaller fish. In Florida and the Bahamas, authorities have organized fishing derbies to counter lionfish attacks on local reef fish. Williams said a little outreach could prevent the lionfish and other predators from gaining a toehold in California. \\"[The aquarium trade] might be the vector that is most easily managed, because it really just requires public awareness.\\" Williams recommends aquarium owners who want to toss live fish call the pet shop that sold the fish, trade or sell fish on eBay (where it's legal to do so) or ask the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for advice. If all else fails, — or \\"if they're queasy about getting rid of it,\\" William's euphemism for killing — she advises to remember it's for a greater good. \\"When these species are released, they can do some major ecological and economic harm,\\" she said.

It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents.

In his 1847 Report on Algeria, Tocqueville declared that Europe should avoid making the same mistake they made with the European colonization of the Americas in order to avoid the bloody consequences. More particularly he reminds his countrymen of a solemn caution whereby he warns them that if the methods used towards the Algerian people remain unchanged, colonization will end in a blood bath. Tocqueville includes in his report on Algeria that the fate of their soldiers and finances depended on how the French government treats the various native populations of Algeria, including the various Arab tribes, independent Kabyles living in the Atlas Mountains, and the powerful political leader Abd-el-Kader. In his various letters and essays on Algeria, Tocqueville discusses contrasting strategies by which a European country can approach imperialism. In particular, the author differentiates between what he terms 'dominance' and a particular version of 'colonization'. The latter stresses the obtainment and protection of land and passageways that promise commercial wealth. In the case of Algeria, the Port of Algiers, and the control over the Strait of Gibraltar, were considered by Tocqueville to be particular valuable. Direct control of the political operations of the entirety of Algeria, however, was not. Thus the author stresses domination over only certain points of political influence as a means to colonization of commercially valuable areas. Tocqueville argued that domination via violent means, though unpleasant, is necessary for colonization and justified by the laws of war. Such laws are not discussed in detail; however, given that the goal of the French mission in Algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense, it can be deduced that Tocqueville would not concur with Just war theory's jus ad bellum criteria of just cause. Further, given that Tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory, his approach does not accord with Just War Theory's jus in bellow criteria of proportionality and discrimination. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Okay, let's break this down so it's easier to understand! Tocqueville was a man who wrote a report about Algeria in 1847. He said that Europe shouldn't make the same mistakes they made when they went to the Americas, otherwise there would be a lot of fighting and people getting hurt. He believed that it was important to treat the people living in Algeria nicely, like the Arab tribes, the Kabyles who live in the mountains, and a powerful leader named Abd-el-Kader. He thought that if the French government did this, their soldiers and money would be better off. Tocqueville talked about two different ways to control a place: 'dominance' and a special type of 'colonization'. Colonization means focusing on important areas that can make a country rich, like the Port of Algiers and the Strait of Gibraltar in Algeria. Dominance is controlling everything in the country. He believed that it was better to control only some areas to make sure that they could become rich. Even though he knew that being violent was not nice, he thought it was necessary to get what they wanted, like land and money. He didn't say much about the rules of war and if being violent was right or wrong in this situation. Does that help you understand it better?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than 25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this. A lot of this is simply because they were treated so badly.\\" Dempsey said most of the tenants who filed suits still live at the apartment complex, although many are trying to find homes elsewhere. \\"The new apartments (they were provided) were not in very good shape. That's actually one of the claims,\\" he said. Question: \\"What is the difference in value between the maximum of a civil claim in 8th District Court, and the reimbursement requested by Dempsey on top of out-of-pocket expenses?\\" Answer: \\"22,000\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

The difference in value between the maximum of a civil claim in 8th District Court and the reimbursement requested by Dempsey on top of out-of-pocket expenses can be calculated as follows: The maximum civil claim in the 8th District Court is 25,000. Dempsey is asking for 3,000 on top of the out-of-pocket expenses for their clients. To find the difference, we simply subtract the smaller amount from the larger amount: 25,000 (maximum civil claim) - 3,000 (reimbursement requested by Dempsey) = 22,000.

One day, a billboard assignment takes him to different parts of the city to find new advertising locations. Rachel Donahue, a free-spirited 25-year-old woman, believes that happiness comes from experiences and adventures, not from material possessions. She has been traveling across the country, seeking new adventures and excitement in her life. While venturing through the city, she found it too overwhelming and decided to take a small nap under a billboard where she felt surprisingly safe and sheltered. As Harlan inspects the location for the new billboard, he stumbles upon Rachel sleeping under it. He is immediately intrigued by her and wakes her up gently. Rachel, who is initially surprised to be discovered, warms up to Harlan, and they begin talking about life, their dreams and aspirations. Harlan expresses that his life feels empty, while Rachel is filled with curiosity and desire to continue seeing the world. They find out that they both share the common dream of opening a small community art center and joining their forces might turn this dream into a reality. Eventually, Harlan invites Rachel to join him on his journey back through the city, to show her the beauty within it while scouting the billboards. They spend their days exploring together, finding hidden gems, art, and culture around every corner. Rachel takes chances by spontaneously creating street art, which only adds to the city's charm.

Suggestion: The question may involve starting question words like WHERE, WHEN, HOW, WHAT (in Spanish). CONTEXT: Grabado contemporáneo en Japón Con la entrada en la modernidad, en Japón se dio una renovación del grabado en madera, el hanga. Tras la muerte de Hiroshige en 1858 el ukiyo-e prácticamente desapareció. Sus últimas manifestaciones corresponden a Goyō Hashiguchi, quien muestra ya una clara influencia occidental en el realismo y el tratamiento plástico de sus imágenes. Con la entrada en el siglo XX, los artistas que practicaban el grabado evolucionaron a un estilo más acorde con el gusto moderno nipón. Uno de sus primeros exponentes fue Hiroshi Yoshida, autor de paisajes influidos por la acuarela inglesa decimonónica. En 1918 se fundó el Nippon Sōsaku Hanga Kyōkai (Asociación de Artistas Grabadores del Japón), un grupo de artistas que sintetizaron la pintura tradicional japonesa con la nueva estética occidental. Entre sus miembros destacan Kōshirō Onchi, Un'ichi Hiratsuka y Shikō Munakata. El primero, influido por Vasili Kandinski, fue el primero en realizar grabados abstractos, de estilo sin embargo netamente oriental por su cromatismo de tonos suaves y por su lirismo e imaginación. Hiratsuka fue más tradicional en técnica y elección de temas, con preferencia por la monocromía blanco-negro, en temáticas que van desde el budismo hasta paisajes y escenas populares, en las que combinaba métodos tradicionales con efectos modernos. Munakata destacó por una obra original, personal y expresiva, de sello inconfundible. Se centró también en temas budistas, generalmente también monocromos, pero con un estilo libre, desenfadado, con un aspecto descuidado pero de gran vitalidad.

Plot title: The Hitcher Movie plot: Jim Halsey, a young man delivering a car from Chicago to San Diego, spots a man hitchhiking in the West Texas desert and gives him a ride. The hitcher, John Ryder, is brooding and evasive; when Jim passes a stranded car, however, Ryder forces his leg down on the accelerator. Ryder calmly states he murdered the driver and intends to do the same to Jim. Terrified, Jim asks what Ryder wants. He replies, \\"I want you to stop me.\\" Ryder strokes Jim's face with a knife while telling him to say, \\"I want to die.\\" When Jim realizes that Ryder never put on his seat belt and the car's passenger door is ajar, he shoves him out of the door. Relieved, Jim continues on his journey. When he sees Ryder in the back of a family car, Jim tries to warn them but becomes involved in an accident. He later comes across the family's blood-soaked car and vomits. At a nearby abandoned gas station, Ryder corners Jim but simply tosses him the keys he took from Jim's car. After Ryder leaves with a trucker, Jim encounters him again at another gas station, where the trucks nearly runs him down as it crashes into the pumps. As Jim flees, Ryder ignites the spilled gas and causes the station to explode. At a roadside diner, Jim meets Nash, a waitress, and calls the police. As Jim relaxes, he finds a severed finger in his food and realizes Ryder is present. The police arrive and, after finding Ryder's knife in Jim's pocket, arrest him. Though the police doubt his guilt, they lock him up overnight as protocol. When Jim wakes, he finds the cell door is unlocked, and all the officers are dead. Jim panics, takes a pistol, and flees. At a gas station, he sees two officers, takes them hostage, and speaks to Captain Esteridge on the radio. As Esteridge convinces Jim to surrender, Ryder pulls up alongside them and kills the two officers. The patrol car crashes, and Ryder disappears again. After briefly considering suicide, Jim reaches a cafe, where Ryder suddenly confronts him. After pointing out Jim's pistol is unloaded, Ryder leaves him several bullets...

Choices: +No +Yes Answer:","completion":"No, the provided statement would not be a reasonable answer to the question regarding how many cells are produced during the cell cycle. The statement discusses genetic diversity, phenotypes, natural selection, and the origin and function of meiosis. It does not directly relate to the number of cells produced during the cell cycle. To answer the initial question, during the cell cycle, a parent cell divides to produce two new cells referred to as daughter cells during a process called mitosis. Each daughter cell receives a complete set of genetic information from the parent cell. In contrast to mitosis, meiosis is a specific type of cell division that takes place during the formation of sex cells (sperm and egg). During meiosis, the parent cell undergoes two successive divisions, resulting in four haploid daughter cells containing half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The process of meiosis introduces genetic diversity through homologous recombination and independent assortment. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \\"how many cells are produced during the cell cycle?\\" would be: - 2 cells during one cycle of mitosis - 4 cells during one cycle of meiosis (in the context of sexual reproduction)"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is the following review positive or negative? After another lunch meeting that I didn't quite have the gumption to suggest be moved, I figured it is time to finally review this place. Once upon a time, I was a poor college student who ate at cheap places, but loved \\"gourmet\\" food. P. F. Chang's somehow built a reputation, albeit hardly deserved, of offering high quality \\"gourmet\\" Chinese food. So, naturally, I decided that I wanted to try P. F. Chang's. One evening before I graduated, the team decided to celebrate our impending freedom from Michael Crow's tuitionary grasp by dining at the P.F. Chang's across the street. I don't recall what I had, but I think it was a Singapore Chow Fun (or something to that effect). It was...passable I guess, but it cost 15, and wasn't even close to being as good as the Singapore Chow Fun I've had at Chinese take-out places in New York, and it cost over twice as much. This poor college student could tell right off hand that this place is incredibly overrated (its average 3-star review is still too generous). Fast forward a few weeks, and I'm in Houston for a job training regime. The group decides to hit up P.F. Chang's for dinner. I figured, since the company is reimbursing, I might as well give it another shot. The appetizers were the best part of my meal, and the rest... well, it was the same drab, flavorless ennui we have all grown to expect from this place. Then, of course, there was our lunch last week (once again, I didn't pay. P.F. Chang's now occupies an important spot on my list of places I would never pay to eat at). I had the honey garlic chicken, which didn't taste honey, garlic, or anything else besides deep fried chunks of chicken dipped in a lame sweet and sour type sauce. I only ate half of it, which is worth mentioning, if you knew me at all. And don't get me started on those lettuce wraps. Those are the most overrated dish in the history of corporate faux-ethnic cuisine. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because their less expensive offering, Pei Wei, manages to be EVEN WORSE! I swear, Pei Wei has only one sauce, whether you buy the Thai or General Tso's. Do yourself a favor and just stick with your local neighborhood Chinese take-out place. You'll get better food for a lower price.","completion":"The review is negative.

To elaborate, a food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy flow as one organism consumes another and is, in turn, consumed by another. In a food chain, the organisms are grouped into different trophic levels, which represents their position in the chain. Fact 1 states that biomass is the total mass of organisms at a trophic level, which means it measures the combined weight of living organisms within that particular level. Fact 2 clarifies that these trophic levels are the various steps within a food chain, illustrating the flow of energy and nutrients from one organism to another. Given these facts, the correct answer to the question \\"Biomass is the total mass of organisms at a step in the what?\\" is the \\"food chain\\". The other options provided are not accurate in describing the role of biomass within trophic levels or ecological systems: - Energy: Biomass is related to energy, as it represents the amount of organic matter that can be converted into useful energy. However, biomass is not a step in energy itself but a property of a step in the food chain. - Plants growth: Plants are part of the trophic level called \\"producers,\\" as they convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis. Though biomass is relevant to plant growth, it is not exclusive to plants and includes the mass of organisms at any step in a food chain. - Agriculture: Agriculture involves the cultivation of plants and animals for human use, but biomass is a broader concept that applies to various ecosystems, not solely restricted to agricultural contexts. - Animal survival: While biomass does include the mass of animals, it also encompasses plants, fungi, and other organisms. Biomass is not exclusive to animal survival, as it applies to all organisms in a trophic level. - Energy usage: Biomass is a representation of the potential energy stored within the organisms at each trophic level of a food chain. It is not a step in energy usage itself but an ecological concept pertaining to food chains and energy flow between organisms. - Kinetic energy: Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. While energy flow among organisms is relevant to biomass, kinetic energy is a separate concept and not directly related to biomass or trophic levels."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Question: \\"How can one change this?\\" Context: \\"Nutritionism is the view that excessive reliance on food science and the study of nutrition can lead to poor nutrition and to ill health. It was originally credited to Gyorgy Scrinis, and was popularized by Michael Pollan. Since nutrients are invisible, policy makers rely on nutrition experts to advise on food choices. Because science has an incomplete understanding of how food affects the human body, Pollan argues, nutritionism can be blamed for many of the health problems relating to diet in the Western World today.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"One can change the negative impact of nutritionism by focusing on a more holistic approach to food and health, rather than just relying on food science and nutrient-based advice. Here are the steps to do this: 1. Educate oneself and others about whole foods and traditional diets: Understanding the importance of consuming a diverse and balanced diet of whole foods can help shift the focus away from individual nutrients. Encourage the study of traditional diets from various cultures, which prioritize the consumption of unprocessed, nutrient-dense foods. 2. Seek advice from diverse sources: While it is essential to consider expert opinions, it's important to consult various sources such as certified nutritionists, dietitians, traditional medicine practitioners, and even cultural knowledge passed down through generations. This helps create a more balanced view of food and nutrition that goes beyond a single nutrient-based approach. 3. Prioritize food quality and variety: Instead of focusing on specific nutrients, aim to consume a diverse range of high-quality, minimally processed foods that provide a wide array of nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. 4. Advocate for updated food policies: Promote changes in governmental food policies that support a more holistic approach to nutrition, emphasizing the importance of whole foods and traditional diets, rather than individual nutrients. This may also involve promoting better food labeling practices, so consumers can make informed choices about their food consumption. 5. Adjust the food environment: Encourage local food systems, support farms practicing sustainable agriculture, and promote better access to fresh, whole foods for all members of society. This helps foster a greater connection between individuals and the foods they eat while ensuring access to healthy options. 6. Emphasize the importance of mindfulness and intuition when it comes to eating: Strengthen the understanding of one's own body and its needs, rather than relying solely on nutrition guidelines. Encourage the practice of listening to hunger cues, the understanding of personal food preferences, and developing a healthy relationship with food. All of these contribute to a more balanced and sustainable approach to nutrition. In conclusion, changing the negative impact of nutritionism requires a collective effort to shift the perspective on food and health from a reductionist, nutrient-based approach to a more holistic and diverse understanding that considers whole foods, traditional diets, and individual needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If Most existing screens were developed for primary care settings to detect alcohol use disorders., can we conclude that \\"Most were made to detect alcohol use disorders.\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the given statement that \\"Most existing screens were developed for primary care settings to detect alcohol use disorders,\\" we can reasonably conclude that \\"Most were made to detect alcohol use disorders.\\" However, it's essential to examine the context and implications of this conclusion further. Primary care settings serve as the initial point of contact for individuals and communities seeking healthcare services. Medical professionals in these settings address a range of health issues, including identifying early warning signs of chronic diseases, mental health, and substance abuse disorders. One of the critical responsibilities of primary care providers (PCPs) is to screen for potential health risks, provide preventive measures, and refer patients to specialized care if necessary. Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are one of the pressing public health issues that primary care providers need to address. AUDs can have severe consequences, impacting not only a person's physical and mental health but also their relationships, job, and overall quality of life. Early detection and intervention can improve outcomes for individuals with AUDs and lessen the societal burden of this disorder. Therefore, it is logical that most existing screens have been developed to detect alcohol use disorders in primary care settings. These screening tools help medical professionals quickly, easily, and accurately identify AUDs in their patients and provide appropriate interventions or referrals to specialized care. Some of the commonly used screening tools include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the CAGE questionnaire, and the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST). However, it's essential to recognize that screens developed for primary care settings don't solely focus on alcohol use disorders. Primary care professionals also screen for other substance use disorders, mental health conditions, and chronic diseases to provide comprehensive and proactive care. Additionally, while most screening tools might have been developed for primary care settings, they can also be employed in other healthcare environments, such as emergency departments or substance abuse treatment centers. In conclusion, based on the statement provided, we can say that most existing screens were made to detect alcohol use disorders, particularly within primary care settings. These screening tools play a crucial role in early detection and intervention, which can significantly impact treatment outcomes and the overall well-being of the affected individual. However, it's important to keep in mind the broader context of primary care and other health issues that need screening and interventions, as well as the potential application of these tools in various healthcare settings."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Today almost everyone knows computers and the Internet.

In a game of beer pong, the objective is typically for each team to eliminate the opponent's cups by throwing or bouncing a small ball (usually a ping pong ball) into the cups placed at the opposite end of the table. The game is usually played in a social setting, with alcohol (beer) in the cups being a staple aspect of the game. However, it should be noted that alternative and non-alcoholic versions of beer pong also exist. After clapping and shaking hands, which might be a way to show sportsmanship and friendly competition, the players would get ready to begin the game. They would take their positions at the table and take turns trying to land the small balls into the red cups. When a ball lands in one of the opponent's cups, the opponent must drink the contents of that cup. The game continues until one team has successfully eliminated all the cups of the opposing team. The logical choice of trying to throw the small balls into the red cups can be further justified by evaluating the inaccuracies and unrelated aspects of the other options: - Being released on to curling shows: This option isn't relevant to the beer pong game since curling is a completely different sport, and this event has no connection to the beer pong game described. - Running down the court playing beer pong: Beer pong isn't played on a court and doesn't involve running. Instead, it is played on a long table where players try to throw or bounce balls into the cups placed at the opposite end of the table. - Putting a mask on and raising their hammers to hit the ball: This option is also unrelated to the context of the beer pong game, as it appears to describe a completely different event or sport. Wearing masks and using hammers are not components of a beer pong game. Based on the context provided, the most logical next event would be for the people to try to throw the small balls into the red cups, signifying the start of the game and progressing with the intention of eliminating the opponent's cups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement discusses the symbolism and choice of red color in traffic signals, while the question is asking about the time when the red color appears at its brightest. The brightness of red or any other color is not determined by the time of day, but by various factors including the intensity of light, viewing angle, and the properties of the surface/material on which the color is displayed. The time of day may indirectly affect the perception of brightness, as natural light conditions change throughout the day, but it is not the primary determining factor. Display screens on digital devices use backlight technology that allows consistent brightness throughout the day, while other materials and surfaces may be more influenced by ambient lighting. To address the stated question, it would be more fitting to discuss how the brightness of colors, including red, depends on the light sources and material properties rather than a specific time when red appears at its brightest."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Social psychology is like studying the smaller parts of the forest, like the leaves on the trees (which are people's feelings and thoughts) and how they connect with other leaves. So, social psychology is a part of sociology, but they focus on different things. Sociology looks at the big picture, while social psychology looks at the smaller parts that make up the big picture.

Ask your doctor about Dapoxetine (Priligy). Talk to your doctor about other medications that delay orgasms.","completion":"Title: Treatment Options for Premature Ejaculation: When Self-Help Techniques Fall Short Introduction Premature ejaculation is a common sexual health concern for many men worldwide. It is characterized by an inability to delay orgasm during sexual activity, often resulting in distress and lowered self-confidence. While there are numerous self-help techniques that can be employed to manage and treat premature ejaculation, sometimes these strategies may be insufficient, necessitating medical intervention. In this article, we will delve into the different medical treatment options available, mainly focusing on the prescription medication Dapoxetine (Priligy). We will also explore additional therapies that can delay orgasms and improve sexual satisfaction for both partners. When to Seek Professional Help Although self-help techniques, such as the start-stop method, the squeeze technique, or Kegel exercises, have been shown to be beneficial for some individuals dealing with premature ejaculation, these methods may not provide lasting results or be effective for everyone. If you have tried these techniques and have not experienced significant improvements, consider seeking professional help from a doctor or sexual health specialist. It is essential to have open communication with your healthcare provider, discussing your symptoms and concerns. This will allow them to accurately diagnose any underlying issues, helping to identify the most suitable treatment and management plan for you. Dapoxetine (Priligy) - An Effective Solution Dapoxetine, also known by the brand name Priligy, is a prescription medication specifically designed to address the issue of premature ejaculation. It belongs to a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These medications work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, appetite, and sexual function. Dapoxetine can effectively delay orgasm and ejaculation by altering the neural pathways responsible for these functions. It is generally prescribed as an on-demand treatment, meaning it is taken only when required, about 1 to 3 hours before sexual activity. However, it is essential to follow your doctor's specific instructions regarding the dosage and frequency of use. Clinical studies have shown Dapoxetine to be effective in improving sexual performance and satisfaction. While it may not be suitable for every individual, it can be a reliable option when self-help techniques do not provide desired results. Other Medications and Treatments for Delaying Orgasm If Dapoxetine is not suitable for you or if you prefer to explore alternative options, there are other medications and treatments available that can help delay orgasms. 1. Topical Anesthetics: These creams or sprays contain anesthetic agents, such as lidocaine or prilocaine, which can reduce penile sensitivity when applied prior to sexual activity. This can result in a longer duration of sexual intercourse and delayed ejaculation. However, some individuals may experience side effects, such as reduced sexual pleasure or local skin reactions. 2. Alternative SSRIs: While Dapoxetine is the only SSRI specifically designed for premature ejaculation, other SSRIs like sertraline, fluoxetine, or paroxetine may also be utilized for off-label treatment. These medications are typically taken daily, regardless of sexual activity. They can help delay ejaculation, but may produce side effects like nausea, dizziness, or decreased libido. 3. Tricyclic Antidepressants: Clomipramine, a type of tricyclic antidepressant, is occasionally prescribed off-label for the treatment of premature ejaculation. Similar to SSRIs, it affects serotonin levels and can delay orgasm. However, it may cause side effects, such as dry mouth, dizziness, and constipation. 4. Couples Counseling and Behavioral Therapy: If psychological factors play a significant role in your premature ejaculation, therapy with a qualified sex therapist or counselor may be beneficial. Such practitioners can help you address relationship issues, reduce performance anxiety, and develop effective communication skills for improved sexual experiences. Conclusion Premature ejaculation can be an emotionally and physically challenging issue for those affected by it. However, there are both self-help methods and medical treatments available to help manage and overcome this problem. If self-help techniques are insufficient, discussing your concerns with a healthcare provider can open up a range of treatment options and offer the potential for improved sexual satisfaction and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the ballet that the composer performed which led to him being carried on the shoulders of his admirers? Answer the above question based on the context below: On 18 February 1914 The Rite received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in St Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky. On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of The Rite as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers. The Rite had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the Queen's Hall in London under Eugene Goossens. Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922, when Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme. Goossens was also responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall, as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that \\"thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it\\". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as \\"the most important piece of music of the 20th century\\".In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being \\"murdered by that frightful butcher\\".

Passage: Lennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \\"Hammer A Nail\\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \\"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\\" Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, \\"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\\" Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work Apple, much to her fury.Ono began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \\"avant-garde bullshit\\". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they \\"made love at dawn\\". When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, \\"Oh, hi.\\" Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.Two years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War. They were married in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969, and spent their honeymoon at the Hilton Amsterdam, campaigning with a week-long Bed-In for Peace. They planned another Bed-In in the United States but were denied entry, so they held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded \\"Give Peace a Chance\\". They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their \\"Bagism\\", first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\". Lennon changed his name by deed poll on 22 April 1969, adding \\"Ono\\" as a middle name. The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the Apple Corps building, where the Beatles had performed their rooftop concert three months earlier. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth. The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire. After Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-size bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last album, Abbey Road.Ono and Lennon moved to New York, to a flat on Bank Street, Greenwich Village.

Plot title: Seven Movie plot: In an unidentified city of constant rain and urban decay, Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is preparing to retire and leave the horrors of the city. Before he retires, he is partnered with Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), a cocky, young and short-tempered cop from Springfield, a comparatively small town. The two investigate the murder of a highly obese man (Bob Mack) who was fed spaghetti until a kick to his stomach burst him open. Somerset investigates the murder while Mills is given the murder case of Defense Attorney Eli Gould (Gene Borkan), with GREED written in Gould's blood on the floor. Gould was forced to carve a pound of flesh off of his body, and subsequently bled to death. The police captain gives Somerset an evidence container with three slivers of a plastic-like material found in the stomach of the obese man, which he was forced to consume along with the spaghetti. Going to the victim's house, Somerset finds three groove marks in front of the refrigerator and finds that the plastic-like slivers fit into them perfectly. Knowing the slivers resulted from the refrigerator being moved, Somerset looks behind it. He finds the word GLUTTONY written behind the fridge in grease, along with a note containing a quote from Milton's Paradise Lost. Somerset theorizes that a serial killer is basing his crimes on the Seven Deadly Sins, with five more to go.To give Mills and Somerset a chance to get along with each other, Mills's wife, Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) invites Somerset over for dinner. While they are eating, a train passes by on the track nearby, making the building and all its contents and inhabitants tremble: the couple mention that that's why the realtor was so nervous for them to see the apartment quickly. After Tracy goes to bed, Mills and Somerset examine case evidence from the two scenes. They find a picture of Gould's wife with blood painted around the eyes.

One in five adults in the UK wants to ban Google Glass completely because of privacy concerns, according to new research. Researchers based in London surveyed 4,000 adults about the rise of wearable technology. Despite 18 per cent of those questioned saying they plan to buy Google Glass when it goes on sale next year, 51 per cent expressed serious privacy concerns about the device and 69 per cent demanded greater regulation. One in five adults in the UK wants to ban Google Glass completely, according to new research. 4,000 adults who were asked about the rise of wearable technology expressed privacy concerns about the devices. Earlier this month the first pornographic app for. Google Glass was released before being quickly banned. Adult app store MiKandi, makers of the headmounted pornography, were told by Google to remove the app and have been prohibited from making any such content. The 'T***. & Glass,' app was downloaded. from the developer's website by 17 Google Glass owners on its debut day,. while the site was visited by some 10,000 people. The app allowed viewers to browse adult content and, with Glass’s capability of displaying and recording, the app also reportedly allowed users to record and upload their own intimate content. The study was. commissioned by web hosting company Rackspace with the Centre for Creative. and Social Technology (CAST) at Goldsmiths, University of London. They asked 2,000 UK adults and 2,000 adults in the U.S. their thoughts on wearable technology including whether they would buy devices, such as Google Glass, how they think they would use it, and what their biggest concerns were. More than half (51 per cent) of all the adults asked expressed serious privacy concerns about using wearable technology, with 53 per cent of UK adults likening it to TV show ‘Big Brother’. Around two thirds of all participants - 61 per cent - think Google Glass and wearable cameras should. be regulated, while 20 per cent think it. should be banned altogether. Respondents in the UK demand greater regulation, 69 per cent, compared to 55 per cent in the US. 'As with all new products that are cutting edge, there is always the question of how current laws, combined with consumer expectations, fit in with the product', says John Haggis, digital media lawyer at London-based media law firm Sheridans. 'When wearable technologies interact with other people and the environment around the user, then potential privacy or copyright issues can arise.' A model for adult app store MiKandi is shown wearing Google Glass. The company released the device's first pornography app called 'T*** & Glass' Monday but it was promptly shut down by Google. Privacy campaigners are concerned about such adult content leading to malware and other risks on wearable technology. 'The challenge for manufacturers of. wearable technologies is ensuring that where the device has the. potential to infringe another person’s rights, that the user is made. aware of how they should be using the device and also for other people. to recognise when the device is being used in a manner which they may. object, such as surreptitious videoing or photographing of people.' 'Hopefully manufacturers will take the. lead in this area so that new regulations are not needed. 'But it. shouldn’t come as a surprise if law makers decide to act to both compel. manufacturers to take privacy and other concerns into consideration when. developing these products, and also to protect people’s expectations of. privacy.' Nick Pickles, director of privacy. and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, added: 'The danger. with Google Glass is that the camera is seeing what you see, all the. time, while the microphone allows nearby conversations to be. eavesdropped on. How Glass works: A German designer created this infographic to show how the eyewear projects an image. 'It. is impossible to guarantee against these devices being hacked, so it. would be surprising if people are allowed to wear them anywhere like. Government buildings or in businesses that handle sensitive intellectual. property. 'While it’s. still dangerous to have a situation where someone could use glass. without permission from the other people who are being monitored by the. device, the implications of them being controlled by an unknown third. party would make phone hacking look like a minor blip. 'Google. Glass offers a uniquely detailed view of your life and your. surroundings and while Google’s main interest is selling advertising,. there are a whole range of reasons why other people might seek to do all. they can to get access to a device. 'The only way to protect yourself and the people around you is to not wear them.' In May, Google's Glass wearable computer was hacked so video and audio can be transmitted online to anyone. The infographic also reveals how Glass is focused so the image always appears sharp. Hackers are able to remotely watch and hear everything a wearer does, and. the hackers recently warned 'nothing is safe once your Glass has been hacked.' Although. Glass does not go on sale to the public until next year, the attack. raises major security and privacy questions over Google's plans for the. device. Despite the negative responses to the Rackspace study, an average of 18 per cent intend to buy Google Glass when it. goes on sale in 2014 - 21 per cent of Americans and 15 per cent of. Brits. 71 per cent of Brits believe that these cloud-powered devices have. enhanced their lives in some way and 12 per cent of UK adults are already using wearable devices to improve their love life. Last week the first marriage proposal using Google Glass was recorded at Leeds Castle in Kent. Whereas 63 per cent of UK and 71 per cent of American respondents said that wearable technology has improved their health and fitness. The CAST study also revealed seven distinct profiles of people who use wearable technology. Another example of wearable technology is smart watches. This mockup of the much-rumoured iWatch was created by MacUser magazine. It is expected to link to an iPhone, and compete with Google's Glass in the wearable computer market. Curious users have no particular health, fitness, food, mood or emotional need for wearable technology. They are simply interested in what happens when they 'play' with these devices. Controllers tend to see everything in their life as 'a selection of parts contributing towards an overall ecosystem.' They will only purchase the device. once they know that it will do what they want it to do and they can. manage their data the way that they want to. The Quantified Selfer wants to track everything they do. Self Medics use wearable devices to take control over health and well-being. Google Glass was hacked earlier this year. Robert Scoble, a tech blogger, tweeted a picture of himself in the shower with Google Glass, which led to experts warning 'private moments' such as these could be seen by hackers. These reports have led to more than half of people asked in a recent study expressing serious privacy concerns about the device, and 69 per cent of UK adults calling for more regulation. Self Medics also often use multiple apps and devices to get an accurate account of their health. Finish line Fanatics love the idea of. the device and are really excited at the start, yet once they realise it. needs to be calibrated, charged, synced and sometimes needs them to. manually add data, the shine wears off. To the Transition Entrepreneur his. phone is classed as a form of ‘wearable tech’ because he always has it. on him, so he needs more from any other gadgets to make them all link. together. And finally, the Ubiquitous Future users are children who will grow up with the next generation of wearable technology and not know any different. The respondents were also asked about future technologies. 32 per cent of respondents said they are most excited about the arrival of nanotechnology such as microscopic ‘robots’ that could, for example, travel through blood and turn off cancer cells. 29 per cent admitted they are excited about the introduction of bionic limbs, a common feature in movies such as i-Robot and Bicentennial Man.

Elena reminded Sarah that while it's essential to have common interests, it's also important to maintain a balance by respecting and appreciating each other's individuality. This means encouraging and supporting one another's personal growth and aspirations. Supporting and encouraging one another was another key element of advice given by Elena. In a good relationship, both partners should uplift, support, and inspire each other to become better versions of themselves. They should offer each other emotional support, share happiness in each other's successes, and show empathy during difficult times. In addition, offering constructive feedback and helping each other grow rather than criticize or undermine each other's efforts is crucial for maintaining a healthy relationship. Elena also addressed the significance of compromise for maintaining a successful relationship. Partners will inevitably face disagreements and conflicts, but the ability to find middle ground and make adjustments for each other's sake requires maturity and understanding. Elena advised Sarah that it’s essential to acknowledge that neither partner is perfect or should have complete control over the relationship. Being willing to make sacrifices and adapt for the sake of their bond demonstrates commitment and love. Lastly, Elena advised Sarah on the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance. This means spending quality time together and making deliberate efforts to keep the spark alive. That can include regular date nights, traveling together, and trying new activities as a way of deepening the connection and maintaining the excitement in the relationship. Having listened to Elena's advice, Sarah was grateful for the insights and understood that fostering a good relationship takes effort from both partners. She was now more aware and better equipped to nurture a loving, supportive, and enduring bond with her partner. By prioritizing open communication, trust, shared values, support, compromise, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance, Sarah knew that she was on the right path to cultivating a beautiful and thriving relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays. Paragraph: Two farmers had different pests attacking their plants. John had a big aphid problem, so he used all the methods available to get rid of them.

John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory. Which tetrapod would live shorter, tetA or tetB? Hint: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer the question, let's go through the information provided step by step and compare tetA and tetB with Aristotle's observations on tetrapods. 1. Adult tetA is heavier than adult tetB. According to Aristotle's theory, brood size decreases with adult body mass. As tetA is heavier, it should have a smaller brood size compared to tetB. 2. TetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. Aristotle's theory states that lifespan increases with gestation period. Since tetA has a longer gestation period, it is likely to have a longer lifespan than tetB. Now, combining these two points, we can infer that tetA is heavier, has a smaller brood size, and has a longer gestation period than tetB. Using Aristotle's observations, these characteristics suggest that tetA should have a longer lifespan than tetB. Therefore, tetB would live shorter than tetA."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot: Chantal Brown, a passionate and creative baker in her late twenties, works tirelessly at her small, but successful bakery in Brooklyn, New York. Known for her unique and flavorful creations, she dreams of one day expanding her business and sharing her passion with the world. When a renowned baking tycoon, Victoria Winters, recognizes Chantal's incredible talent, she offers Chantal the chance of a lifetime: to head her newest and largest bakery in the affluent Connecticut town of Greenwich. But there's just one problem: Chantal's New York roots run deep, and leaving the city means leaving behind her family, friends, loyal customers, and her longtime boyfriend, Marcus.

Torn between the life she built in Brooklyn and the potential of a flourishing career in Connecticut, Chantal struggles to make a decision that could change everything. Meanwhile, Chantal meets Pete, a fellow Brooklyn baker who understands her struggles and shares her passion for baking.

Translate to English English:","completion":"If everyone already knows this, why don't we achieve the right results? There could be myriad reasons why the correct results are not being achieved even when everyone possesses the necessary knowledge. To provide a detailed analysis of these reasons, let's break it down into different factors: 1. The Practicality Of Application: Knowing something does not automatically equate to being able to execute it efficiently. Certain skills, expertise, training, and experience are a necessity in various fields to utilize the knowledge effectively. It's often harder to apply the knowledge in practical contexts than in theoretical ones, as it could involve complex operations and procedures. 2. The Human Factor: Differences in interpretation, personal biases, and individual perspectives can be another hindrance to achieving the desired results. These variables can cause differences in people's approach to using the knowledge, which may lead to diverse outcomes, not all of which are the desired or right ones. 3. The Lack of Resources: There could be a deficiency of resources- financial, human, or temporal- necessary to apply the knowledge effectively. Even when people are aware of the right course of action, they may be unable to take it due to these constraints. 4. Unforeseen Circumstances: Despite having all the knowledge, there could be unforeseen factors or unpredictable changes in circumstance that could prevent the achievement of the right results. These could involve changes in market trends, natural disasters, policy alterations, or sudden technological advancements. 5. Communication: Even if everyone knows something, they may not communicate effectively about it. Poor communication can result in misunderstandings, mistakes, and inefficiencies, all of which can prevent the achievement of the right results. 6. Lack of Motivation: People need motivation to put their knowledge into action. If they lack motivation, they may not apply their know-how effectively to achieve the right results. This motivation can come from various sources, like rewards, recognition, personal growth, or the intrinsic satisfaction of doing good work. So, even if everyone knows something, it's not guaranteed that the right results will be achieved. There must be an effective application, suitable interpretation, sufficient resources, fortuity, effective communication, and the right motivation for knowledge to translate into the desired result."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located.

Write an article with the title: \\"Hundreds Worldwide Hit by Loss Of AP Tests\\"","completion":"Title: Hundreds Worldwide Hit by Loss Of AP Tests Introduction In recent times, education has been presented with numerous challenges as a result of unforeseen events across the global stage. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruptions, prompting educational institutions to reevaluate their approaches to learning and testing. One such disruption has been the marked absence of Advanced Placement (AP) tests for which hundreds of students worldwide have felt the impact. In this article, we will discuss the importance of AP tests, the causes of educational disruption, and the subsequent implications for students, educators, and institutions. The Importance of AP Tests Advanced Placement tests, originally introduced by the College Board in the United States, are significantly valued for their role in providing high school students with the opportunity to pursue college-level education. These tests are widely recognized as an effective means of measuring students' abilities to succeed in higher education. By partaking in AP courses and subsequent exams, students are challenged to think critically, develop analytical skills, and enhance their knowledge base. Consequently, securing a high score on these tests increases the likelihood of college admission, access to scholarships, and exemption from introductory courses in renowned universities. Causes of Educational Disruption The most significant cause of disruption to AP tests in recent times has been the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With schools and testing centers forced to close their doors in adherence to social restrictions, it became increasing difficult for these tests to be administered safely and fairly across the world. While the College Board initially implemented alternative approaches, including a shorter, online version of the test, various technical and logistical issues led to chaos and dissatisfaction among students and educators alike. Additionally, other factors have played a part in the loss of AP tests. Changes in education policy and funding have meant that some schools and colleges have chosen to limit their participation in the AP program. Furthermore, growing concerns about standardized testing and the increased emphasis on holistic education have caused some institutions to reconsider the value of AP tests in determining a student's readiness for higher education. Implications for Students The absence of AP tests has led to numerous consequences for thousands of students across the globe, particularly for those who were unable to take the test as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Firstly, their college and university applications have been left without a key record of academic achievement, depriving them of a valuable opportunity to demonstrate their competencies to admission officers. This is especially devastating for students from less privileged backgrounds, who may have relied on high AP test scores to earn scholarships and financial aid for their education. Secondly, the loss of AP tests has deprived students of the opportunity to earn college credits, which would afford them a significant advantage in their transition to tertiary education. By providing exemptions from introductory courses, students who excel on AP tests can save time, effort, and tuition fees. Consequently, the loss of AP tests has left many students feeling wronged and debilitated as they strive for academic success. Implications for Educators and Institutions Educational institutions and educators have also faced challenges as a result of the loss of AP tests. For the College Board, the primary issue has been their ability to preserve the credibility and worth of the organization amidst the crisis. As students experience negative consequences from the pandemic and subsequent testing disruptions, the College Board has had to navigate criticism while developing alternative solutions for AP testing. Furthermore, high schools offering AP courses have faced difficulties in keeping students engaged and ensuring that they have an opportunity to showcase their abilities. The loss of AP tests has forced teachers to reevaluate their teaching methods and focus on preparing their students for a tentative academic landscape. This has required a significant amount of adaptation and innovation from educators, which carries inherent challenges. Conclusion In conclusion, the loss of AP tests due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other factors has had far-reaching impacts on students, educators, and institutions worldwide. As stakeholders continue to navigate the challenges presented by these disruptions, it is essential for them to remain adaptable and innovative in their pursuit of academic excellence. Policymakers, educational institutions, and individuals must work together to develop feasible and effective solutions that support students in reaching their full potential in spite of an increasingly uncertain educational landscape."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

New England has three states where at least 96% of the population is white, that's like 96 white marshmallows out of 100! A black man living in Vermont, one of those states, says if a non-white person moves there, it feels like they are a very special player in a sport. People might look at them a little differently, because there are so few non-white people in the state. They are like a colorful marshmallow standing out in a sea of white ones. Do you know why these states have so many white people and very few African Americans? Some people think it's because in the 1930s and 1940s, there were not many jobs for African Americans, so they went to other places with more opportunities. It's like if you wanted to make s'mores, but there simply weren't enough chocolate bars in the store, so you'd go to another store instead. These are the 10 states with the highest percentage of white people, like our big bag of marshmallows: 1. Maine 2. Vermont 3. New Hampshire 4. West Virginia 5. Iowa 6. Wyoming 7. Idaho 8. Montana 9.

He says that \\"afire requires oxygen to burn\\" and \\"in the vacuum of space, there's no oxygen to burn\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","completion":"In space. Based on the hints provided by your teacher, it's evident that the best answer to the question, \\"Where is fire impossible?\\" is \\"In space.\\" This is because, as your teacher pointed out, fire requires oxygen to burn, and there is an absence of sufficient oxygen in the vacuum of space to support a fire. Fire is a chemical reaction between oxygen and a combustible substance, usually producing heat, light, flames, and smoke. In order for fire to ignite and be sustained, it needs a fuel source, oxygen, and heat. This is often referred to as the fire triangle. If any one of these elements is absent or removed, the fire cannot start or will extinguish. On Earth, oxygen is abundant in our atmosphere, making it generally easy to start and maintain a fire with the appropriate fuel source. However, in space, there is virtually no oxygen to support the combustion process. While there may be minuscule amounts of oxygen dispersed throughout space—particularly near planets, moons, or other celestial bodies—these amounts are not sufficient to support a sustained fire. In addition, the vacuum of space and the lack of atmospheric pressure make it challenging for fire to transfer heat to its surroundings. These factors, combined with the lack of oxygen, render space an environment where fire is, for all practical purposes, impossible. In conclusion, when faced with the quiz question \\"Where is fire impossible?\\", the best answer—supported by your teacher's hints—is \\"In space.\\" The vacuum of space deprives fire of the necessary oxygen and environmental conditions that would otherwise allow it to ignite and burn, rendering it a location where fire cannot exist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are several factors that contributed to Randy's ability to devote more time and effort to their fitness journey. Firstly, Randy had better time management skills and prioritized their fitness goals. They were disciplined in setting a workout schedule, allocating sufficient time for warming up, cooling down, and engaging in various exercises targeting different muscle groups. This consistent approach allowed Randy to develop a well-rounded fitness routine, gradually improving their strength, flexibility, endurance, and overall performance in the gym. Secondly, Randy's intrinsic motivation played a crucial role in their ability to maintain their fitness. They had a clear vision of their health objectives and understood the importance of staying active for long-term physical and mental well-being. This inner drive fueled their consistent gym sessions and helped them to push through challenges and plateaus. Moreover, Randy was proactive in educating themselves about proper nutrition, workout techniques, and recovery methods. They were open to learning from personal trainers, fitness experts, and their fellow gym-goers. By continuously refining their knowledge and applying it to their fitness practices, Randy was able to optimize their gym performance and achieve more significant results. In contrast, Adam struggled to make fitness a priority in their life. They may have faced challenges such as a demanding work schedule, family obligations, or a lack of motivation, all of which impacted their ability to dedicate consistent time and effort to working out in the gym. Additionally, Adam might not have had the same level of knowledge or support that Randy had in terms of workout techniques, nutrition, and recovery, which ultimately hindered their progress in achieving their fitness goals. Furthermore, Adam could have struggled with setting realistic goals and expectations for their fitness journey. This might have led to feelings of demotivation and disappointment, further discouraging them from working out diligently and routinely. In conclusion, working out in the gym came easier for Randy than Adam due to Randy's ability to take the time to maintain their fitness effectively. This was achieved through better time management, intrinsic motivation, continuous learning, and the right support network. Meanwhile, Adam faced obstacles that prevented them from consistently dedicating time and effort to their fitness, making it more difficult for them to experience the same level of success as Randy in the gym."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Despite Eli Manning throwing three touchdowns and for over 400 yards, his three interceptions proved costly. While the Giants were in the red zone to win the game, Victor Cruz slipped on a pass from Manning, and the pass was intercepted by Brandon Browner, who returned it for a Seahawks touchdown, ending the game.

So, the equation becomes: 3 * w = 0 Now, we want to find out how much each toy (w) is worth. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3. So, w = (0 / 3) which means w = 0 And that's it! The answer is w = 0.

The woman is a \\"possible victim\\" of sexual assault by Bill Cosby, Officer Jane Kim said, adding it is an open case but declining further comment. Cosby is coming under increasing scrutiny as more and more women accuse him of sexual misconduct. At least 21 women have made claims against him in recent weeks. The 77-year-old comedian and actor has vehemently denied most of the accusations that he drugged and sexually assaulted young women. He has never been charged with a crime. One of the latest accusations comes from former Playboy bunny P.J. Masten, who says there are 12 more ex-bunnies with similar stories who don't want to come forward. Masten told CNN's Alisyn Camerota that Cosby drugged and raped her at a Chicago hotel. She said she told her supervisor soon afterward and was told no one would believe her because Cosby and Playboy founder Hugh Hefner were good friends. Hefner responded to the allegations in a statement Friday, saying \\"Bill Cosby has been a good friend for many years and the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening.

Given the question: Question: \\"Why would a party notify the other party?\\" Context: \\"Treaties are not necessarily permanently binding upon the signatory parties. As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification. For example, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of denunciations, the number of parties falls below 40. Many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal. Article 56 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced unless:\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"A party would notify the other party in the context of a treaty to express their intention to withdraw from or denounce the treaty, as long as they follow certain procedures of notification. This is done to maintain transparency and respect for the international legal framework. Since international law obligations arise from the consent of states, treaties often include provisions allowing parties to withdraw under specific conditions, ensuring that their sovereignty remains intact. In the example mentioned, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if, due to denunciations, the number of parties falls below 40. This means that parties must inform each other if they intend to withdraw, in order to maintain an accurate count of the signatory parties and determine the ongoing validity of the treaty. Article 56 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties outlines that if a treaty does not explicitly mention denunciation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a party cannot unilaterally denounce the treaty unless: 1. The intention to allow denunciation or withdrawal can be inferred from the terms of the treaty or its purpose. 2. A denying party can provide convincing reasons that denunciation or withdrawal was, in fact, not intended by the other parties to the treaty. Therefore, notifying the other party in the context of a treaty serves the purpose of conveying a state's intention to withdraw or denounce the treaty, ensuring that the remaining parties are aware of the evolving status of the treaty and can act accordingly. This practice upholds the principles of good faith, transparency, and respect for the international legal system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel's death, performances were given in Florence (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart first heard it. For the performances in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that \\"The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr.\\" In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, \\"Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large).\\" In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, \\"The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers\\".In continental Europe, performances of Messiah were departing from Handel's practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, Johann Adam Hiller presented Messiah with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side.

While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere. - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world. - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration. - The Seaward River is a river in New Zealand 's South Island .

Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence, it is crucial to analyze it thoroughly. The following sentence states: \\"Could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip.\\" To break down this sentence, we can start by examining the key phrases— \\"confusing and horrifying,\\" \\"intense and engrossing,\\" and \\"head-trip.\\" First, the phrase \\"confusing and horrifying\\" has a negative connotation. Often, people view confusion and horror as undesirable emotions. Therefore, mentioning these emotions in this context hints at negative sentiment. Second, the phrase \\"intense and engrossing\\" seems to bear a neutral to positive connotation. Intensity and engrossment might not directly point to positive emotions. However, when used to describe an experience, it suggests that the experience is powerful and captivating. These attributes often make an experience memorable and, thus, somewhat positive. Lastly, the term \\"head-trip\\" is often used to describe a disorienting and unusual experience, one that takes the individual on a mental roller coaster. Its meaning is mostly neutral but could lean towards a negative connotation, depending on one's perspective. Considering the sentence's overall analysis, the sentiment appears to be leaning towards negative due to the strong effect of the phrase \\"confusing and horrifying.\\" However, the presence of the phrases \\"intense and engrossing\\" and \\"head-trip\\" adds a level of complexity and nuance to the sentiment, making it not solely negative. In sum, the sentiment of the sentence can be classified as predominantly negative with some underlying nuanced and neutral-to-positive aspects."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: A grandson of Vail's co-founder died Tuesday in an avalanche while he was skiing near the resort in an area notorious for deadly slides. Tony Seibert, 24, a grandson of Peter Seibert Sr., was killed, and three others were injured in the out-of-bounds avalanche, the Eagle County Coroner's Office announced Tuesday evening. Friends and family of Seibert's expressed sorrow and condolences throughout the afternoon and evening on social media. Seibert was in a group with three others when the avalanche hit. The others, who were not identified, were rescued and treated for minor injuries. Seibert's father is Peter Seibert Jr. His mother, Teri Salani Seibert, works for the Vail Ski Patrol, according to her Facebook page. It was unclear whether she was on duty Tuesday. The Eagle County Sheriff's Office released this image of the East Vail chutes area where one person was killed in an avalanche on Tuesday, January 7, 2014. (Eagle County Sheriff's Office) In a statement, Chris Jarnot, Vail Mountain's senior vice president and chief operating officer, called the death \\"a shocking and terrible tragedy.\\" Jarnot added: \\"Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to Tony's entire family. I want to acknowledge how integral the Seibert family is to the fabric of our community. ...

The avalanche struck about 11:35 a.m. in East Vail Chutes, said Jessie Mosher, an Eagle County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman. Advertisement Rescuers and emergency workers responded to the area, which is between Vail Pass and Vail Mountain. The Colorado Avalanche Information Center reported the incident shortly after 1 p.m., describing it as \\"large\\" and having happened at or near timberline. Earlier, the CAIC rated the area at \\"considerable risk\\" for an avalanche, describing \\"dangerous avalanche conditions.\\" Its warning says: \\"Cautious route-finding and conservative decision-making essential.\\" There have been several fatalities in that part of East Vail over the past two decades. It is one of the deadliest resort-accessible areas for avalanches in the country, according to experts. There were two avalanche-related deaths only days apart in early January 2008, and five deaths between 1986 and 1996. On Dec. 22, skiers triggered two avalanches on steep east and southeast terrain of East Vail Chutes, also known as Charlie's Death Chutes. One of the avalanches trapped a skier before he was rescued by his brother. Tony Seibert, who was a noted free-style skier in the Vail community, appeared in recent Warren Miller Entertainment productions. The Eagle County Sheriff's Office released this image of the East Vail chutes area where one person was killed in an avalanche on Tuesday, January 7, 2014. (Eagle County Sheriff's Office) In Miller's \\"Climb to Glory,\\" he appeared in a segment in which he followed the tracks of his grandfather's 10th Mountain Division. Peter Seibert, who died in 2002 at the age of 77, served with the division, which trained in Colorado, during World War II. He was part of the U.S. Ski Team and is credited, along with rancher Earl Eaton, as being the father of Vail Resorts, which opened in December 1962. Tony Seibert and his co-star, ski-film veteran Chris Anthony, were planning to screen \\"Climb to Glory\\" on Thursday at Beaver Creek's Vilar Performing Arts Center as a benefit for Colorado Ski & Snowboard Museum education programs. Anthony said involvement in the film had a deep impact on Tony Seibert. \\"We got really focused, and he really started appreciating not just the blood lines that he came from but also the industry and the sport. He truly loved skiing. His heart was into it,\\" Anthony said. \\"The movie, it really impacted him. It made him really proud.\\" Seibert had a solid ski background in both racing and freeskiing, able to move seamlessly between big mountain lines and terrain-park features and jumps. \\"Climb to Glory\\" was one of his first ski films. \\"He was such a positive character on the shoot,\\" Anthony said. \\"There was no ego. He was just glad to be a part of it.\\" Max Bervy, the director of \\"Climb to Glory,\\" said Seibert and other descendents were equipped with 10th Mountain Division gear to make the film — a challenge for modern-day skiers used to water-resistant clothing, steel edges and wide skis. \\"I think he really understood the significance of being a representative of a 10th Mountain guy,\\" Bervy said. \\"He understood the significance that his grandfather had, not just in the Vail Valley but in the ski industry as a whole.

The 24-year-old Seibert is the grandson of Pete Seibert Sr., \\"who is widely credited along with Earl Eaton as the man who discovered the terrain that would become Vail Mountain,\\" Eagle County Coroner Kara Bettis said in a statement. Tony Seibert was a talented extreme skier who made and performed in ski videos. Three other people survived with non-life threatening injuries and were released after a rescue operation late Tuesday afternoon, Eagle County sheriff's spokeswoman Jessie Mosher said. The avalanche was reported about 11:30 a.m. to the Vail Public Safety Communications Center, Mosher said. The East Vail Chutes are in the backcountry outside of Vail Mountain's ski area boundary. The Vail Resort development plan describes the East Vail Chutes as, \\"an extremely steep, avalanche prone bowl that drains down to Interstate 70 or to East Vail.\\" The Colorado Avalanche Information Center tweeted that the large avalanche was triggered near the treeline. \\"This is a shocking and terrible tragedy,\\" Chris Jarnot, chief operating officer of Vail Mountain, said in a statement. \\"Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to Tony's entire family. I want to acknowledge how integral the Seibert family is to the fabric of our community; their contributions to Vail date back to Vail founder Pete Seibert, Tony’s grandfather. This is an incomprehensible loss and we will support the Seibert family and our community through this difficult time. Tony had recently starred in, \\"Climb to Glory,\\" a documentary that will forever be a tribute not only to the famed 10th Mountain Division and his family's legacy but to a wonderful albeit tragically too short life.\\" The grandfather was a veteran of the famed 10th Mountain Division, an elite unit of World War II soldiers who trained for skiing, mountain climbing and winter warfare in Eagle County. Pete Seibert was badly wounded during combat in northern Italy, but returned home to help create Vail's European-style ski resort in the early 1960s. He died in 2002. Friends posted condolences on the Facebook page of Tony Seibert's sister, Lizzie Seibert. \\"Lizzie! My prayers are with you and your family. He will always hold a special place in this valley, and in your heart. go out there and ski for him. Stay strong!\\" a friend wrote. \\"I can't even put into words how terrible this is I love u guys and I am so sorry. Tony will never be forgotten,\\" another friend posted. Several agencies worked on the rescue, including: Eagle County Sheriff’s Office, Vail Mountain Rescue Group, Vail Ski Patrol, Eagle County Paramedic Services, Flight for Life, Breckenridge Ski Patrol K9 Avalanche Team, High-Altitude Army National Guard Aviation, and Vail Police Department. The avalanche was near the area where an avalanche last month caught Edwin LaMair, burying him up to his neck. LaMair's brother and a friend were able to rescue him. |||||","completion":"A young man named Tony Seibert, who was the grandson of the person who co-founded a ski resort named Vail, sadly passed away in an avalanche while he was skiing near the resort. This area has had many deadly avalanches before. Tony was with three other people when the avalanche happened, and they were all rescued with just minor injuries. Many people shared their sadness and sympathy on social media. The Seibert family is very important to the community, and everyone is supporting them during this difficult time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are.

Answer:","completion":"The best answer would be 'root growth'. The capacity of soil to absorb water greatly impacts the root growth of a plant. Moisture in the soil is used by the plant's roots for absorbing water and nutrients, which are necessary for the plant's growth. Looser soil allows roots to extend and expand more comfortably. If the soil is compact and less receptive to water absorption, roots struggle to penetrate through the soil and this can hinder their growth. Moreover, roots need oxygen, which is also found in the small pockets of air within loose soil.

Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. x = 8, equation weights = [7, 5, 0]","completion":"The task involves calculating the value of a polynomial equation by substituting a specified value for 'x'. The equation to be used is not provided in conventional terms, instead we are given the weights that represent the polynomial equation.

Read this and answer the question After the Spanish in the 16th century, the first permanent European settlers of North Carolina were English colonists who migrated south from Virginia. The latter had grown rapidly and land was less available. Nathaniel Batts was documented as one of the first of these Virginian migrants. He settled south of the Chowan River and east of the Great Dismal Swamp in 1655. By 1663, this northeastern area of the Province of Carolina, known as the Albemarle Settlements, was undergoing full-scale English settlement. During the same period, the English monarch Charles II gave the province to the Lords Proprietors, a group of noblemen who had helped restore Charles to the throne in 1660. The new province of \\"Carolina\\" was named in honor and memory of King Charles I (Latin: Carolus). In 1712, North Carolina became a separate colony.

Among the scenes excised was Streisand’s character playing an instrumental version of “Evergreen” on the guitar for her lover, played by Kris Kristofferson. The song, co-written by Streisand and Paul Williams, went on to win the Academy Award for best original song. “I learned how to play the guitar and wrote the melody to ‘Evergreen’ for this film and ended up cutting this scene out,” said Streisand in a statement. “Who knew the song would become such a big hit?” Netflix is keeping Streisand’s actual performance of the song under wraps until the movie premieres, but a few hours ahead of the special edition going live, Billboard has an exclusive snippet of a vulnerable, nervous Streisand preparing to play the unfinished song for Kristofferson, asking, “If you don’t like, it, I’d like you to tell me… If you laugh, I’ll kill you.” The fact that she can pluck guitar strings at all with those long fingernails is admirable. As previously announced, Netflix is also posting six vintage Streisand television specialsL My Name Is Barbra(1965), Color Me Barbra (1966), Barbra Streisand: A Happening in Central Park (1968), Barbra Streisand and Other Musical Instruments (1973), Barbra Streisand: The Concert (1994) and Barbra Streisand: Timeless (2001).

Since the work of Franz Boas and Bronisław Malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, social anthropology in Great Britain and cultural anthropology in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons, long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on participant-observation or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism, holism, and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques. This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas' arguments against 19th-century racial ideology, through Margaret Mead's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism. Ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How was cultural and Social anthropology distinguish from other sciences around the world?","completion":"Cultural and social anthropology are distinguished from other sciences around the world through several key aspects: 1. Emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons: Anthropologists seek to understand and compare human societies from various cultures, examining their similarities and differences. This comparative approach allows researchers to gain a broader understanding of human behavior, social structures, and cultural practices. 2. Long-term in-depth examination of context: Unlike other social sciences that may rely on short-term observations or data collection, anthropologists often immerse themselves in the communities they study for extended periods of time. This approach allows them to gain a deeper understanding of the context in which people live, their beliefs, customs, and social dynamics. 3. Participant-observation or experiential immersion: Anthropologists use participant-observation as a primary research method, participating in the daily lives of the people they are studying to collect meaningful and detailed data. This immersive approach enables researchers to understand the nuances of a culture and its practices from an insider's perspective. 4. Cultural relativism: Anthropologists advocate for cultural relativism, the idea that one should not judge other cultures based on one's own cultural beliefs and values. Instead, researchers should approach their subjects with an open mind and try to understand the context in which certain practices or behaviors occur. 5. Holism: Anthropologists study a culture in its entirety, considering all aspects of a society as interconnected and interdependent. This holistic perspective recognizes that cultural practices, social structures, and beliefs are influenced by various factors and cannot be understood in isolation. 6. Use of ethnography: Ethnography is a primary research design in anthropology, involving detailed descriptions of the culture, traditions, and social dynamics of the group being studied. The resulting text, or ethnography, is a comprehensive analysis of the observations and experiences gathered during the fieldwork. 7. Framing cultural critiques: Anthropologists often use their findings to critique, challenge, or question dominant cultural narratives and power structures. This has been illustrated prominently with regard to issues such as race, gender equality, sexuality, colonial oppression, and multiculturalism. These distinctive features set cultural and social anthropology apart from other sciences as they focus on understanding human societies in a diverse, comprehensive, and context-sensitive manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","completion":"- Directly impacting a step of the process A very rainy season will have a direct impact on the process of limestone erosion and the formation of caverns, specifically on the steps involving rainfall and the dissolution of limestone due to increased acid content. Here's a detailed explanation of how this would affect smaller or less caverns: 1. Rain picks up carbon dioxide as it falls to earth: During a very rainy season, there will be a larger volume of rainwater available to interact with atmospheric carbon dioxide and absorb it, thereby increasing the potential for acidic rain. 2. The rain falls on the soil over the limestone: With more rainfall, the soil overlying the limestone will be saturated at a quicker rate. This can lead to an increased infiltration rate in some areas, allowing more acidic rain to reach the limestone below the soil. 3. The carbon dioxide in the rain washes through the soil: The increased rainfall will lead to a higher volume of carbon dioxide-rich rainwater washing through the soil. 4. The carbon dioxide turns into acid: As more carbon dioxide is carried through the soil by the rainwater, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, increasing the overall acidity of the rainwater. 5. The acid in the rain gets to the limestone below the soil: The higher volume of acidic rainwater infiltrating the soil will result in more acid reaching the limestone, leading to a higher incidence of erosion. 6. The acid dissolves the limestone: Due to the increased volume and acidity of the rainwater, the process of limestone dissolution will be accelerated, causing the limestone to erode at a faster rate than usual. 7. Acid continues to erode the limestone with more rain over time: During a very rainy season, this process of limestone erosion will persist and continue at an elevated rate, leading to the formation of more and larger caverns over time. 8. The eroded limestone sometimes forms caves: As the limestone dissolves and erodes due to the increased acid content, it can form cavities, channels, and conduits within the rock. Over time, these can develop into smaller or less caverns. In conclusion, a very rainy season directly impacts various steps of the process, accelerating the dissolution and erosion of limestone, which can lead to the formation of a greater number of smaller or less caverns. The perturbation in this scenario is the direct impact on the steps of the process caused by the increased volume and acidity of rainwater during a very rainy season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

PUBLISHED:. 13:50 EST, 26 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:38 EST, 26 November 2013. A strain of the food-poisoning bug MRSA has been found in turkeys being prepared for Christmas on a farm in East Anglia. In a move that will alarm consumers, however, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has decided to keep the name of the farm and the retailers it supplies a secret. It said last night there was no need to stop the sale of the turkeys as the risk to consumers was ‘very low’ if the meat was handled carefully and cooked thoroughly. Turkeys on a farm in East Anglia have tested positive for food poisoning bug MRSA but the Government's food and farming department has refused to say which on or who they supply (file picture) Defra said its Animal Health and. Veterinary Laboratories Agency had found Livestock-Associated. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (LA-MRSA) in poultry during a. routine inspection on the farm in East Anglia. This is not the same form of the bacteria that cause illness in people, and usually clears within 24 hours. Officials. said the most likely reaction if it affected humans would be a skin. rash, similar to eczema, rather than the stomach problems associated. with food-poisoning bugs. Defra said that once the turkeys had been slaughtered and sold, the farm owner would disinfect barns. However,. the fact that the department has decided to keep details of the case. secret – protecting the farming and food industry at the expense of. providing information to consumers – will raise questions about its. priorities. The Government. has been criticised for its handling of the scandal of horsemeat being. sold in beef products earlier this year. So far, not a single meat. producer, supermarket or abattoir has been prosecuted. Government department Defra has decided there is no need to stop the sale of the birds which are destined for Christmas lunches across England. Steve. Wearne, of the Food Standards Agency, said: ‘Any risk of contracting. MRSA through meat from animals with these bacteria is very low when. usual good hygiene and thorough cooking practices are observed. ‘All poultry should be handled hygienically and cooked thoroughly to destroy any bacteria that may be present.’ However,. hundreds of thousands of people in the UK are believed to fall ill. every year because they do not handle and cook poultry with the. necessary care. Professor. Angela Kearns, head of the Staphylococcus Reference Unit at Public. Health England, said: ‘There are many different strains of MRSA that. cause illness in people, but this is not one of the strains that we are. overly concerned about. Defra has decided against naming the farm or its suppliers in a move sure to anger consumers. ‘This. strain is relatively widespread in livestock in Europe, including. countries from which meat is regularly sourced by the UK. There are no. known cases of people contracting MRSA from eating meat.’ Professor. Peter Borriello, of the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, said:. ‘LA-MRSA has been identified in livestock in a number of countries and. is not considered to represent a significant risk to animal health and. welfare.’ n Sainsbury’s has. recalled packs of its own-brand Kids 20 Pork Cocktail Sausages because. they had the wrong ‘use by’ date of December 25. The correct date should. have been November 25.

Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman.

McVeigh later said that he had contemplated assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.A resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor.

Apple New Zealand's parent company is registered in Australia and the two countries have a treaty where tax is only paid in one jurisdiction. Apple said the arrangement was legal. \\"Apple is the largest taxpayer in the world and we appreciate and respect the role taxes play as necessary and important in our society,\\" the company said. \\"We follow the law and pay tax on everything we earn, wherever we operate. Apple aims to be a force for good and we're proud of the contributions we've made in New Zealand over the past decade.\\" Some tax experts have called the arrangement unusual given that Australia's corporate tax rate of 30% is higher than New Zealand's. Apple has been criticised by politicians including New Zealand Green Party co-leader James Shaw. \\"It is absolutely extraordinary that they are able to get away with paying zero tax in this country,\\" he told the NZ Herald. \\"It looks like their tax department is even more innovative than their product designers.\\" New Zealand revenue minister Judith Collins recently announced plans to strengthen tax laws.

However, the European Commission found the final tax paid by Apple amounted to a rate of less than 2%, which the Commission declared illegal. Apple is engaged in a major legal battle with the European Union after it was ordered to pay a record 13bn euros in retroactive taxes to Ireland. It is appealing against the decision.

Summarize this article: Once your chicken has had time to soak up all the spicy goodness from the marinade, you're ready to finish the dish. Fill a large saucepan, deep skillet, or deep-fryer with the oil. You've cut your chicken into small pieces, so the oil doesn't need to be too deep, but it should fill about 1/3 of the pan. The ideal frying temperature for oil is usually listed as around 365ºF (or 185ºC). You can test the oil by dropping a cube of white bread into the oil. When it browns in fifteen seconds, your oil is ready. It's a good idea to begin with frying just one or two pieces of chicken. This will help you verify that the oil is hot enough and give you an idea of how long it will take to fry the chicken. If you don't want to risk messing up a whole piece of chicken you can cut one piece in half and use that. If the oil doesn't cover the chicken piece entirely, be sure to rotate it after a couple of minutes. If you rotate too early, the chicken may stick, so allow for a crust to form. Once the chicken is browned and crisped remove it from the oil. Now cut it in half to make sure that it's cooked through. This should take about 5-8 minutes. Once you've finished frying your test pieces, continue frying the remainder of the chicken. Depending upon the size of your pan, you may want to do this in batches. If you fry in batches, place your finished chicken on a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. This will help soak up any residual oil and keep the chicken from getting soggy. Keep the oven on a very low setting, around 200ºF or 93ºC. If you fry in batches, you will need to allow the oil to get back up to temperature before adding a new batch. Your finished chicken could get cold in that time. Once you've fried all of your chicken pieces, garnish with finely chopped fresh coriander leaves. You may also want to give the dish a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.

It was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book Let Me Take You Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche. Its title is a reference to J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and suggests a continuation of the book. The real Mark David Chapman is currently incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, he has not spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title \\"Chapter 27\\" suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, to the point of attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield. According to the British music magazine Mojo, the title was also inspired by Chapter 27 of Robert Rosen's book Nowhere Man: The Final Days of John Lennon (2000). Rosen's book explores the numerological meaning of the number 27, \\"the triple 9\\", a number of profound importance to John Lennon. Lennon was deeply interested in numerology, particularly Cheiro's Book of Numbers, along with nine and all its multiples. It was Chapman's goal, according to Rosen, to write Chapter 27 \\"in Lennon's blood\\". Like Chapman, Schaefer is a fan of both The Beatles and J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, and said he began the script to try to understand \\"how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art. It really bothered me, because Lennon and Salinger have always made me feel so much better, and so much less alone.\\" Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Yes, there are several other interesting aspects about Chapter 27 and the various elements related to the film, its production, and reception. Some of these aspects include: 1. Jared Leto's transformation for the role: In order to accurately portray Mark David Chapman, actor Jared Leto gained a significant amount of weight - around 67 pounds. This physical transformation involved Leto consuming a diet high in sugar and unhealthy fats. The weight gain had a detrimental effect on his health, including causing gout and making it difficult for him to walk. Leto later described the experience as \\"the most challenging thing\\" he had ever done. 2. Controversy and mixed reactions: The film evoked mixed reactions from critics and audiences, with some praising Leto's performance and the exploration of Chapman's psyche, while others felt that the film might unintentionally glorify the actions of Lennon's killer. The film was also criticized for focusing too much on the murderer's perspective, rather than honoring John Lennon's legacy. 3. Film festival screenings and limited release: Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007, where it received a polarized response from the audience. It later screened at several other film festivals before receiving a limited theatrical release in the United States. 4. Awards and nominations: Jared Leto's portrayal of Mark David Chapman earned him a few nominations and an award. He won the Best Actor award at the Zurich Film Festival and was nominated for the Breakthrough Actor award at the Gotham Awards and for Best Actor at the Stockholm Film Festival. 5. Other notable cast members: The supporting cast of Chapter 27 includes notable actors like Lindsay Lohan, who plays a fan of John Lennon named Jude, and Judah Friedlander, who portrays a photographer named Paul. These aspects highlight the various facets of Chapter 27 as a film which drew attention, debate, and recognition for the topics it dealt with and the performances within it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"U.K. surgeons separate twin girls joined at head\\"","completion":"Title: U.K. surgeons separate twin girls joined at head Introduction: In a groundbreaking medical procedure, a team of skilled surgeons in the United Kingdom has successfully separated twin girls who were joined at the head. This intricate and delicate surgery marks a significant achievement in the field of medicine, offering new hope and possibilities for conjoined twins and their families. Step 1: Background of the case The twin girls, aged 10 months, were born with a rare condition known as craniopagus – which occurs in only about one in every 2.5 million live births. In this particular case, the twins were joined at the top of their heads, sharing crucial blood vessels and brain tissue. The complexity of their situation presented numerous challenges to their medical team, who spent months preparing for the life-changing operation. Step 2: Description of the surgical procedure The highly complex surgery, which spanned an incredible 50 hours, began with a pre-operative planning phase. The surgical team conducted extensive research, reviewed case studies of similar occurrences, and utilized modern imaging technology to create 3D models of the twins' anatomy. This vital preparation phase allowed the surgeons to develop a detailed roadmap of the procedure to ensure the best possible outcome for the girls. Once the planning stage was complete, the actual surgery took place in three sequential stages. The first stage involved the separation of the blood vessels and the outer layer of the brain. In the second stage, the surgeons concentrated on the neurological aspects – namely, separating the shared brain tissue, ensuring each twin had sufficient brain matter and creating a protective barrier between them. The final stage of surgery saw the reconstruction of each girl's skull and the closure of the incisions. Step 3: Post-operative care and recovery Following the successful operation, the twin girls were carefully monitored in their post-operative recovery. Their surgery was followed by a rigorous rehabilitation process, including physical therapy, speech therapy, and ongoing neurological assessment, to support their development and ensure each child could lead an independent life. Step 4: The significance of the surgery The successful separation of these conjoined twins exemplifies not only the incredible skills of the medical team but also the advancements in medical technology that have made such surgeries possible. This case offers hope to other families with conjoined children and demonstrates the importance of investing in research and technological developments in the field of medicine. Conclusion: The bravery of these twin girls, their family, and the dedicated medical team has culminated in a remarkable story of success and hope. As these young children continue to grow, they stand as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the boundless possibilities of medical science. Their journey serves as an inspiration to those working tirelessly to push the boundaries of medical innovation, ensuring that our world continues to move forward in search of new discoveries and solutions that may ultimately change lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

After a long career in the government of Sir Joh Bjelke - Petersen , Ahern became his successor amidst the controversy caused by the Fitzgerald Inquiry into official corruption . Ahern 's consensus style and political moderation contrasted strongly with Bjelke - Petersen 's leadership , but he could not escape the division and strife caused by his predecessor 's downfall . - The Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct (the \\"Fitzgerald Inquiry\\") (19871989) into Queensland Police corruption was a judicial inquiry presided over by Tony Fitzgerald QC. The inquiry resulted in the deposition of a premier, two by-elections, the jailing of three former ministers and a police commissioner who was jailed and lost his knighthood. It also led indirectly to the end of the National Party of Australia's 32-year run as the governing political party in Queensland. - The National Party of Australia (also known as The Nationals or simply, The Nats) is an Australian political party. Traditionally representing graziers, farmers, and rural voters generally, it began as the Country Party in 1920 at a federal level.

His uncompromising conservatism (including his role in the downfall of the Whitlam federal government), his political longevity, and his leadership of a government that, in its later years, was revealed to be institutionally corrupt, made him one of the best-known and most controversial political figures of 20th century Australia.

McDade want to make a National Historic Site? Answer the above question based on the context below: When Scranton agreed to take on Steamtown, U.S.A., it was estimated that the museum and excursion business would attract 200,000 to 400,000 visitors to the city every year. In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent. Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the spending of 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study.

(CNN) -- Inter Milan exited this season's Champions League to Marseille in a dramatic finish to their last 16, second leg tie in the San Siro Tuesday. Trailing visitors Marseille 1-0 from the first leg, 2010 winners Inter leveled on aggregate through a Diego Milito goal in the 75th minute. The match looked headed for extra time until a long clearance found Marseille substitute Brandao, who eluded two defenders before beating Julio Cesar with a low shot. Inter were stunned but had time for one more attack, Giampaolo Pazzini earning a penalty as he was brought down by Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda, who was sent off for a second yellow card. Pazzini converted the penalty with the last kick of the match as it finished 2-2 on aggregate. But the French side went through on the away goals rule to reach the quarterfinals of the competition for the first time since 1993 The defeat will heap the pressure on Inter's coach Claudio Ranieri, who has seen his side win just once in 11 games to slide down Serie A. Both Wesley Sneijder, who was later substituted, and Milito spurned cast-iron chances in the first half to give Inter some breathing space in the tie and they paid a heavy price. \\"This match is a picture of our season, we played better than Marseille and even tonight we had the clearer chances,\\" Ranieri told Italian television. \\"Over 180 minutes Marseille had three shots on goal but in football the team who wins is the one that scores, so well done to them.

Hume's essay Of the Original Contract argues that governments derived from consent are rarely seen, and civil government is grounded in a ruler's habitual authority and force. It is precisely because of the ruler's authority over-and-against the subject, that the subject tacitly consents; Hume says that the subjects would \\"never imagine that their consent made him sovereign\\", rather the authority did so. Similarly, Ferguson did not believe citizens built the state, rather polities grew out of social development. In his 1767 An Essay on the History of Civil Society, Ferguson uses the four stages of progress, a theory that was very popular in Scotland at the time, to explain how humans advance from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without \\"signing\\" a social contract.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN) -- Paul McCartney has never dwelled in yesterday, even if he remembers it quite well. At 71, he's just released his 24th post-Beatles album, \\"New,\\" and is generating music at a pace that puts artists a quarter of his age to shame. And in a remarkably candid cover story by Rolling Stone contributing editor Jonah Weiner (on newsstands Friday October 25) McCartney discusses the drive that keeps him creating fresh music — as well as the memories of his Beatles bandmates that continue to shape his life today. Look back at Paul McCartney's remarkable career in photos Perhaps most shockingly, McCartney reveals that although he's always teaming up with fresh talent — \\"New\\" features production by Adele collaborator Paul Epworth, Amy Winehouse producer Mark Ronson, Giles Martin (son of legendary Beatles producer George) and frequent Kings of Leon partner Ethan Johns — he also consulted with another source, someone who knows his music intimately: John Lennon. See where your favorite tracks rank on OPTIONS: - Adele's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - Amy Winehouse's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - Beatles's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - CNN's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - Ethan Johns's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - George's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - Giles Martin's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - John Lennon's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - Jonah Weiner's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - Kings of Leon's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - Mark Ronson's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - McCartney's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - Paul Epworth's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - Paul McCartney's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs - Yoko Ono's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs","completion":"- Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs Explanation: The news story is about Paul McCartney and his new album, \\"New.\\" Since the Rolling Stone magazine is mentioned in the story with a cover story about McCartney's career, it's most logical that the list of 100 Greatest Beatles Songs would be from Rolling Stone.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai\\" correctly answer the question \\"What languages spoken by the different attorneys of Neighborhood Legal Services?

Solve 96 = -105*o + 129*o for o.","completion":"To solve the equation 96 = -105*o + 129*o for the variable o, we need to combine the terms with o and isolate the variable on one side of the equation, and then find the value of o. We can break this down into several steps. Step 1: Combine terms with o First, we observe that there are two terms with 'o': -105*o and 129*o. To combine these terms, we add the coefficients -105 and 129: -105 + 129 = 24 So, the combined term is 24*o. Step 2: Rewrite the equation Now we can rewrite the equation with the simpler term, like this: 96 = 24*o Step 3: Solve for o Now, we want to isolate o on one side of the equation. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 24: 96 / 24 = 24*o / 24 This simplifies to: 4 = o So, the solution to the problem is o = 4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Viñolas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard. Meanwhile, Viñolas has learned that Artiguez's mother is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Martín to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother.

He considered democracy an invaluable gift, especially when God allows a people to freely elect their own authorities and overlords. His appreciation of democracy stemmed from the potential it held to protect the rights of ordinary people.

In his vision, a mixture of aristocracy and democracy provided the optimal balance for a functioning political system.

As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that maintained his position as court painter? from the following article ? Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.Several of Goya's friends, including the poets Juan Meléndez Valdés and Leandro Fernández de Moratín, were overt afrancesados: the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte. He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority, and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops. During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, Wellington from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals. Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for The Disasters of War. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance. The final plates are testament to what he described as \\"el desmembramiento d'España\\"—the dismemberment of Spain. A:","completion":"The article does not provide a specific name for the person who maintained his position as court painter. However, it can be inferred from the context that the Spanish painter, Francisco Goya, could be the person in question. This inference is based on several clues within the text. The text mentions that \\"he had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution,\\" which aligns with what is known about Goya's political belief. Furthermore, the following line \\"He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary\\" suggests that the unnamed painter maintained a position at the court, which also aligns with Goya's historical role as a painter for the Spanish court. Moreover, the text discusses how the unnamed painter \\"painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, Wellington from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals.\\" These examples mirror Goya's well-documented painting style and subjects. Goya was known for his portraiture of prominent figures, further suggesting that the unnamed court painter in the text is most likely Francisco Goya. Lastly, the text mentions that the court painter was working on drawings that would form the basis for The Disasters of War. Goya is the known creator of The Disasters of War, a series of prints that depict the atrocities of war, specifically the Peninsular War. This definitive connection strongly implies that the person who maintained his position as court painter in the text is Francisco Goya. However, it is important to note that while the contextual clues strongly suggest that Francisco Goya is the court painter referred to in the text, the article itself does not explicitly state this. Therefore, this interpretation should be seen as a highly plausible inference based on the evidence provided within the text."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cellphone camera footage captures the moment the unidentified officer pushes Lamard Joye against a basketball court fence in the Coney Island Surfisde housing project in the early hours of September 16. Moments before the video was taken, Joye's friend Terrell Haskins was stopped by police and reportedly roughed up, which led Joye to shout 'is that necessary?' Scroll down for video.

An officer responded by coming over to search Joye as well, who was out walking with his sister Lateefah Joye, a professional basketball player in Europe. That's when a friend starting taking the video which shows the officer push Lamard against the fence. Larmard then references Eric Garner, the man who recently died after being put in a choke-hold by NYPD officers. 'Are you going to do to me what you did to the guy in Staten Island?' Lamard asks. The officer is seen reaching into the man's pocket and then pushing him away. 'Gimme my money!' Joye shouts, as the cop sprays him in the face with pepper spray. Lateefah then interjects saying: 'How ya gonna take his money?' and 'That's robbery'. Sting: After her brother felt a wad of cash leaving his pocket, Lateefah Joye interjects and asks for the officer's badge number. Instead she gets a shot of pepper spray to the face. When she asks for his badge number, Lateefah too gets a painful shot of pepper spray. 'I'm outraged,' the former West Virginia University player told the New York Daily News. 'It's very outrageous.

Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia . It contains two species , which both are critically endangered : Huso dauricus ( Georgi , 1775 ) ( kaluga ) Huso huso ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) ( beluga ) Recent data indicate a polyphyletic origin of the genus Huso , and it is suggested that the two Huso species should be included in the genus Acipenser .

The Garden Grove woman answered a series of questions to create and print a form to file with the court. \\"It's easy,\\" said Adams, 25. \\"I thought I'd have all kinds of questions and have to take the forms home.\\" A University of California, Irvine, study released Wednesday found an interactive computer system effectively helps people fill out paperwork for restraining orders, eviction defense, small-claims cases and requests for filing-fee waivers. Not only does the system make life easier for people who can't afford a lawyer, but it also might improve efficiency in the courts because the forms, which are printed out when completed, are easy to read and are being filled out correctly, the study found. Since the program started in 2000, more than 6,000 people have used the free system, located in public buildings throughout Orange County. The system was developed by the Legal Aid Society of Orange County with about 800,000 in grants. The program avoids legal jargon, offers a courthouse video tour and sticks to a fifth-grade vocabulary. Users can choose English, Spanish or Vietnamese. Kiosks are in courthouses in Fullerton and Orange, the district attorney's family-support office, the Legal Aid Society in Santa Ana, Irvine City Hall and the San Juan Capistrano Library. The program is also available online. Bob Cohen, executive director of Legal Aid, said the study should clear the way for expansion throughout California. Locally, a program for divorce petitions will be added this summer. Cohen said the system proves the benefit of technology tailored to those who aren't computer-savvy. He said much of the technology now available requires Internet skills and access. Low-income people, however, have less access to computers and less experience using them. \\"Our clients have to catch up, and they have to become a part of the mainstream,\\" Cohen said.

Summarize: Twenty-year-olds who started antiretroviral therapy in 2010 are projected to live 10 years longer than those first using it in 1996, it found. Doctors say that starting treatment early is crucial to achieve a long and healthy life. Charities say there are still too many people unaware they have the virus. This is particularly true in the developing world, where the majority of HIV deaths occur because access to drugs is limited. The study authors, from the University of Bristol, said the extraordinary success of HIV treatments was a result of newer drugs having fewer side effects and being better at preventing the virus from replicating in the body. It is also more difficult for the virus to build up a resistance to the most recent drugs. Improved screening and prevention programmes and better treatment of health problems caused by HIV are thought to have helped, too. But many people with HIV still do not live as long as expected, especially those infected through injecting drugs. Antiretroviral therapy involves a combination of three or more drugs which block the normal progress of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). They have been called \\"one of the greatest public health success stories of the past 40 years\\". Jimmy Isaacs, 28, discovered he had been infected with HIV by a former partner nearly three years ago. He takes three drugs once a day at 18:00 and will continue to do so for the rest of his life. \\"My health is absolutely fine. I'm eating healthily and drinking healthily,\\" he said. \\"It doesn't impact on my job and hasn't impacted on my social life either.\\" Although it took two changes of medication to find the right combination for him, he says he now has no side effects at all. \\"I had heard a lot of bad stories about the drugs back in the '90s - but when I did some research, I realised the drugs had completely changed.\\" Not all his employers have been supportive since his diagnosis and he says that is down to ignorance. His current employer has given him time off to tour the country and speak to students and school pupils about HIV prevention and treatment. The researchers looked at 88,500 people with HIV from Europe and North America who had been involved in 18 studies. They based their life-expectancy predictions on death rates during the first three years of follow-up after drug treatment was started. They found that fewer people who started treatment between 2008 and 2010 died during this period compared with those who began treatment between 1996 and 2007. The expected age at death of a 20-year-old patient starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) after 2008, with a low viral load and after the first year of treatment, was 78 years - similar to the general population. Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the study showed how much things had changed since the start of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s. But he said it also meant people aged over 50 now represented one in three of all those living with HIV. \\"As it stands, the healthcare, social care and welfare systems simply aren't ready to support the increasing numbers of people growing older with HIV. \\"We need a new model of care to better integrate primary care with HIV specialist services, and we need a major shift in awareness and training around HIV and ageing, so that we're ready to help older people live well in later life,\\" he said. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: \\"It's a tremendous medical achievement that an infection that once had such a terrible prognosis is now so manageable, and that patients with HIV are living significantly longer. \\"We hope the results of this study go a long way to finally removing any remaining stigma associated with HIV, and ensuring that patients with HIV can live long and healthy lives without experiencing difficulties in gaining employment and - in countries where it is necessary - obtaining medical insurance.\\" She said steps were being taken to increase appropriate HIV testing by GPs. The proportion of people with undiagnosed HIV has fallen steadily over the past 20 years. But one in eight people with HIV is still thought to remain undiagnosed.

Article: The Red Cross is an international organization which cares for people who are in need of help. A man in a Paris hospital who needs blood, a woman in Mexico who was injured in an earthquake, and a family in India that lost their home in a storm may all be aided by the Red Cross. The Red Cross exists in almost every country around the world. The world Red Cross organizations are sometimes called the Red Crescent, the Red Mogen Daid, the Sun, and the Red Lion. All of these agencies share a common goal of trying to help people in need. The idea of forming an organization to help the sick and wounded during a war started with Jean Henri Dunant. In 1859, he observed how people were suffering on a battlefield in Italy. He wanted to help all the wounded people regardless of which side they were fighting for. The most important result of his work was an international treaty called the Geneva Convention . It protects prisoners of war, the sick and wounded, and other citizens during a war. The American Red Cross was set up by Clara Barton in 1881. Today the Red Cross in the United States provides a number of services for the public, such as helping people in need, teaching first aid and providing blood.

Step 3: Determine which option best fits the context. Comparing the given options, \\"canon\\" directly aligns with the description of a device that launches projectiles. The other options, such as \\"machine\\" or \\"weapon\\", are more general and can encompass a variety of devices. \\"Battle field\\" describes a location rather than a device, and \\"tornado\\" is a natural occurrence unrelated to the purposeful launching of projectiles. Step 4: Explain why a human would choose \\"canon\\".

The United States Capitol, often called the Capitol Building, is the home of the United States Congress, and the seat of the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government. It sits atop Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Though not at the geographic center of the Federal District, the Capitol forms the origin point for the District's street-numbering system and the District's four quadrants. The original building was completed in 1800 and was subsequently expanded, particularly with the addition of the massive dome, and expanded chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.

Summarize this article: Sources tell Mediaite Keith Olbermann and MSNBC were headed for a breakup long before Comcast’s rise to power, but clearly something set the divorce into motion quickly today, with network promos set to run touting Olbermann’s role in MSNBC’s coverage of next week’s State of the Union address–and, notably, a Keith Olbermann promo running on MSNBC in the hour after the host signed off and left the network. MSNBC executives have long planned for the day the network’s star might be sent packing, and the rise of Rachel Maddow at MSNBC–along with the grooming of Lawrence O’Donnell as a potential replacement for Olbermann–appears to have hastened the host’s departure. While Olbermann and his iconic Countdown have been immensely important in the resurgence of MSNBC, Olbermann’s friction with management has been a sticking point. At many points–including the recent suspension over political contributions–tensions rose so high as to lead to serious discussions inside MSNBC about firing their star. With Maddow enjoying both immense popularity inside MSNBC and very strong ratings for her Rachel Maddow Show, Olbermann’s invincibility as the heart and soul of MSNBC’s brand became softer. In recent weeks, sources tell Mediaite there have been meetings on the topic of Keith Olbermann and his future at the network. Did Comcast–as many Countdown viewers seem to suspect–order Olbermann out? It appears that the end of the Olbermann era at MSNBC was not “ordered” by Comcast, nor was it a move to tone down the network’s politics. Instead, sources inside the network say it came down to the more mundane world of office politics–Olbermann was a difficult employee, who clashed with bosses, colleagues and underlings alike, and with the Comcast-related departure of Jeff Zucker, and the rise of Maddow and O’Donnell, the landscape shifted, making an Olbermann exit suddenly seem well-timed. The blunt, brief statement of Olbermann’s final day, compared to the long, lush programming memo that makes no mention of Olbermann suggests that while the timing may not have been set, the foundation had been laid for today’s move. Update: Brian Stelter reports the following statement from Comcast: “Comcast has not closed the transaction for NBCU and has no operational control at any of its properties including MSNBC. We pledged from the day the deal was announced that we would not interfere with NBCU’s news operations. We have not & we will not.” Watch Olbermann’s Sign-off below: Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| Keith Olbermann took an unexpected bow from MSNBC on Friday, announcing on air in the last 10 minutes of his show that it would be his final episode of “Countdown.” The departure was a stealth move, MSNBC insiders told POLITICO, with many top executives and on-air personalities kept out of the loop as the decision was made. It came, one insider said, “Out of the … blue!” Text Size - + reset VIDEO: Olbermann's sign off POLITICO 44 “This will be the last edition of ‘Countdown’,” Olbermann said at about 8:50 as he led into his final commercial break. “I will explain that, next.” Neither MSNBC nor Olbermann offered a reason for the departure, but several sources close to the situation said its roots lay in Olbermann’s defiant reaction to being suspended after POLITICO discovered that he had donated to Democratic candidates without telling his bosses. Although Olbermann’s political leanings were quite clear, the move violated NBC policy, and Olbermann’s response angered NBC News President Steve Capus in particular, according to former MSNBC anchor David Shuster. “It’s no secret that Steve was particularly upset – justifiably so – with how he handled the suspension,” he said in an interview with Anderson Cooper. On air, Olbermann hinted that he had just learned of the end of his show Friday, and suggested his departure was not voluntary. “I think the same fantasy popped into the head of everybody in my business who has ever been told what I have been told: this will be the last edition of your show,” he said. “You go to the scene from the movie ‘Network,’ complete with the pajamas and the raincoat, and go off on a verbal journey of unutterable vision and you insist upon Peter Finch’s gutteral resonance and you will the viewer to go to the window, open it, stick out his head and yell,” he continued. “You know the rest. In the mundane world of television goodbyes, reality is laughably uncooperative.” “Good night and good luck,” he said, quoting Edward R. Murrow, as he signed off for a final time. Olbermann had two years left on the four-year, 30 million contract he signed in 2008. Insiders said discussions about his departure had been going on for some time. The end of Olbermann’s contract coincided with the departure of NBC Universal chief executive Jeff Zucker, three days after Comcast’s takeover of a majority share in the company was approved by the U.S. government. Cooper opened his CNN show with the story, noting that the move was so sudden that some at MSNBC didn’t appear to get the memo as promos for this show were still airing after his final signoff. He said his sources blamed the fallout from the merger and Zucker’s departure. Zucker was widely viewed as Olbermann’s “protector,” as Cooper put it. But MSNBC rejected this reading. “Comcast had nothing to do with this decision,” said MSNBC spokesman Jeremy Gaines. “They were informed this week following regulatory approval.” Comcast distanced itself from any notion that it had something to do with the decision, releasing a midnight statement saying it had not yet closed its transaction with NBC Universal and so does not yet have operational control. “We pledged from the day the deal was announced that we would not interfere with NBCU’s news operations. We have not and we will not.” ||||| Cable host Keith Olbermann and news channel MSNBC abruptly parted ways on Friday night, as the network announced it had agreed to end his contract and the last installment of his show would air that evening. The surprise announcement strips MSNBC of its most-watched evening anchor after an increasingly tempestuous relationship, coming less than three months after the network briefly suspended the fiery host. Enlarge Image Close MSNBC A shot from Keith Olbermann's last episode on Friday. \\"MSNBC thanks Keith for his integral role in MSNBC's success and we wish him well in his future endeavors,\\" the network said in an emailed statement just before the end of Mr. Olbermann's Friday program. MSNBC and Mr. Olbermann have been discussing parting ways for some time, according to a person familiar with the matter. That person said they ultimately came to a financial agreement to end his contract two years early. The host signed a four-year deal worth 30 million in 2008. Neither side offered an explanation for their split. On the air, Mr. Olbermann said it would be his last show, and thanked viewers. The quick change Friday set off a game of musical chairs, as MSNBC moved to fill the hole \\"Countdown with Keith Olbermann\\" will leave behind. The network said its 10 p.m. host Lawrence O'Donnell would move into Mr. Olbermann's slot 8 p.m. slot beginning on Monday. Meanwhile radio host Ed Schultz, who has hosted a 6 p.m. show on MSNBC since 2009, will take over Mr. O'Donnell's 10 p.m. time slot. Executives have said tensions between Mr. Olbermann and the network have been running high since their spat in November, when the host was suspended for making three donations to Democratic candidates without seeking approval beforehand. One of them was U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who faced a tough re-election battle at the time, and narrowly survived an alleged assassination attempt earlier this month. Mr. Olbermann missed two broadcasts during his suspension. MSNBC asked Mr. Olbermann to make a public apology for running afoul of its ethics rules before reinstating him, according to another person familiar with the matter. But Mr. Olbermann resisted so long as MSNBC kept him suspended, the person said. After MSNBC lifted its suspension, Mr. Olbermann released a statement apologizing to viewers. But at least some senior executives and others at the network remained angry over Mr. Olbermann's behavior, before and during the affair, a person familiar with their thinking said at the time. Mr. Olbermann made his debut on \\"Countdown\\" in 2003 and quickly became the face of MSNBC's more liberal tilt in its evening hours. Along with fellow host Rachel Maddow, he helped catapult MSNBC ahead of Time Warner Inc.'s CNN in the size of its primetime audience. Mr. Olbermann averaged 1 million viewers in 2010 in the 8 p.m. hour, according to Nielsen Co. figures from MSNBC, a distant second to Fox News's Bill O'Reilly, but nearly double what CNN averaged against him in the hour. (News Corp. owns both Fox News and the Wall Street Journal.) Mr. Olbermann's exit comes on the eve of Comcast Corp.'s takeover of network parent NBC Universal, in a deal that received regulatory approval in Washington earlier this week. An MSNBC spokesman said that Comcast was informed of the decision, but not involved in making it. A Comcast spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that the cable giant currently has \\"no operational control\\" at MSNBC, adding, \\"We pledged from the day the deal was announced that we would not interfere with NBC Universal's news operations.

China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii.

You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Paragraph: Matt is reheating some leftover pizza in the microwave for his stepchildren, Lauren and Emily. Lauren likes her pizza at a high temperature when reheated so Matt cooks it for a long time. Emily likes her pizza at a lower temperature so Matt only puts hers in the microwave for a couple seconds. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Are the particles in Emily's pizza moving faster or slower than in Lauren's pizza? Answer:","completion":"The particles in Emily's pizza are moving slower than in Lauren's pizza. In the given paragraph, we can understand that Matt is reheating leftover pizza for his stepchildren, Lauren, and Emily. Lauren prefers her pizza at a high temperature, so Matt cooks it for a longer time. In contrast, Emily likes her pizza at a lower temperature, so Matt only reheats it for a couple of seconds. As we know from the background information, temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Higher temperatures indicate that the particles of matter are moving at higher speeds, whereas lower temperatures indicate that the particles are moving more slowly. Since Lauren's pizza is cooked for a longer time and thus has a higher temperature, we can deduce that the particles in Lauren's pizza are moving more quickly than the particles in Emily's pizza. On the other hand, Emily's pizza is only heated for a couple of seconds, resulting in a lower temperature. This means that the average kinetic energy of the particles in Emily's pizza is less than that in Lauren's pizza. Consequently, the particles in Emily's pizza are moving more slowly compared to the ones in Lauren's pizza. In conclusion, the particles in Emily's pizza are moving slower than those in Lauren's pizza due to the differing temperatures achieved by different cooking durations in the microwave."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It helps you slow down enough to breathe deeply, to calm your thoughts, and to research the natural world filled with wonders. And yes, to love yourself more. Try to spend one day for a long travel on foot--far from the requirements of work and family. First, choose a date and mark it as your \\"relaxing day\\". Next, choose a place that you want to visit on foot. If you enjoy being out in nature, head to a wide and open place. Try to choose a place that's no more than 15 minutes from your home. You want to spend your time walking, not driving. Walk at an easy speed so you can walk longer and farther. If you normally walk two miles a day, go for four to six miles. Wear comfortable clothes. If it's warm, wear a hat to protect your face. And don't forget your sunglasses-- not only to protect your eyes but also to give you a sense of privacy while you walk. Before you go out, get up early so you can spend a few minutes relaxing. Relaxing is something few people spend in their spare time, but it leaves you feeling much lighter and less annoyed. Read something relaxing before you leave home, and it'll put you in a different condition of mind. And, of course, eat a healthy breakfast and drink plenty of water.

Tony Abbott -- the opposition leader who hopes to unseat Kevin Rudd as prime minister on September 7 -- has been the worst offender, with a series of missteps that have threatened to derail his center-right Liberal Party's momentum. Opinion polls have Abbott's coalition marginally ahead of Rudd's center-left Labor Party by 52 points to 48. The most serious blunder came on Tuesday when Abbott praised a female candidate's \\"sex appeal\\" while campaigning in the Western Sydney seat of Lindsay.

Can we infer the following? The KPMG study shows that the government's policies contributed towards the growth and success of the three industries","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the KPMG study focused on high tech, high value, and pharmaceutical industries, all of which have experienced significant growth. The hon. member emphasizes that the growth of these industries can be traced back to the government's research and development (R&D) policies. The KPMG study, as referenced, seems to have analyzed these specific industries and determined their growth trajectories, paying attention to factors that contributed to their successes. The mention of the government's R&D policies by the hon. member suggests that these policies played a crucial role in fostering an environment conducive for growth and innovation within these sectors. The government's R&D policies might have included a range of measures, such as: 1. Financial support: This could involve the allocation of funds to businesses and institutions involved in R&D in the form of grants, tax credits, or other financial incentives. These resources would enable organizations to invest in cutting-edge research and technologies, helping them stay competitive and contribute to overall industry growth. 2. Intellectual property protection: Robust policies to safeguard inventions, patents, and other intellectual property rights are crucial in promoting innovation. By ensuring that businesses can protect their ideas, the government may encourage more risk-taking and investment into R&D. 3. Collaboration and partnerships: The government's policies might also have promoted collaborations between the private sector, universities, and research institutions. Joint research and partnership is often a key driver of innovation, enabling the sharing of resources, knowledge, and expertise to fast-track the development of new products and solutions. 4. Education and talent development: Governments play a central role in ensuring that industries have access to a skilled workforce by investing in education and training programs related to high tech, high value, and pharmaceutical industries. Fostering talent is essential for driving ongoing innovation and success in these sectors. 5. Infrastructure development: Government policies may also have provided support for crucial infrastructure, such as research facilities, labs, and technology hubs, fostering the growth of the industries concerned. 6. Market access and trade: Government policies in market access and international trade can also benefit the growth of specific industries, especially by opening up new markets and lowering barriers to entry for businesses. In conclusion, based on the information presented, it can be inferred that the KPMG study appears to show a link between the government's policies and the growth and success of the high tech, high value, and pharmaceutical industries. The exact details of the study and the policies in question would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the government's contributions to the industries' growth. However, based on what has been shared, the overall conclusion seems to support the view that the government's R&D policies have played a significant role in the advancement of these industries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Summarize Real Madrid's victory against Basle Real Madrid managed to secure a 1-0 win over Basle at St Jakob-Park in Switzerland on Wednesday. This victory, while hard-fought, sets the stage for a crucial match between Liverpool and Basle in the coming weeks, as both teams vie for their spot in the last 16 of the Champions League. Step 2: Discuss Liverpool's performance against Ludogorets Liverpool's recent 2-2 draw against Ludogorets in Bulgaria puts pressure on the Reds to perform exceptionally well against Basle for a chance to progress.

Fully automatic (submachine-guns, etc.) are \`\`prohibited weapons'' and require explicit permission from central government to permit ownership. Generally, such permits are not available to private citizens. Semi-automatic rifles over .22 in (5.6 mm) and pistols are similarly \`\`prohibited'', although there are exceptions for short barrelled breech-loading semi-automatic and revolver pistols for use for the humane dispatch of animals (classed under section 5). There are also very limited exceptions for pistols both to preserve firearms of historic or technical interest (classed as section 7 firearms) and to enable use by elite sports teams. Semi-automatic shotguns are restricted to a magazine capacity of no more than two shot and is held under section 2 of the Firearms Act, although a 'multi-shot' shotgun can be owned under section 1 (restricted firearms and ammunition) of the Firearms Act. Where the term 'multi-shot' is used, this refers to either a Semi-automatic or pump action shotgun with no restriction on magazine capacity. All other rifles and their ammunition are permitted with no limits as to magazine size, to include: target shooting, hunting, and historic and muzzle-loading weapons, as well as long barrelled breachloading pistols with a specific overall length, but not for self-defence; however if a home-owner is threatened they may be used in self-defence, so long as the force is reasonable. Shotgun possession and use is controlled, and even low-power air rifles and pistols, while permitted, are controlled to some extent. A Firearm Certificate issued by the police is required for all weapons and ammunition except air weapons of modest power (of muzzle energy not over 12 ft⋅lbf (16 J) for rifles, and 6 ft⋅lbf (8.1 J) for pistols). Shotguns with a capacity of three rounds or less (up to guns with a magazine holding no more than two rounds, in addition to one in the chamber) are subject to less stringent licensing requirements than other firearms and require a shotgun certificate; shotguns with higher capacity require a Firearm Certificate. Can we conclude that can you own a pump action shotgun in the uk?","completion":"Yes, you can own a pump action shotgun in the UK, subject to specific licensing and regulations. If the pump action shotgun has a capacity of three rounds or less (up to a magazine holding no more than two rounds, in addition to one in the chamber), it requires a shotgun certificate. If the pump action shotgun has a higher capacity, it would require a Firearm Certificate under section 1 (restricted firearms and ammunition) of the Firearms Act."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In May 2008, Johansson released her debut album Anywhere I Lay My Head, which consists of one original song and ten cover versions of Tom Waits songs, and features David Bowie and members from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Celebration. Reviews of the album were mixed. Spin was not particularly impressed with Johansson's singing. Some critics found it to be \\"surprisingly alluring\\", \\"a bravely eccentric selection\\", and \\"a brilliant album\\" with \\"ghostly magic\\". NME named the album the \\"23rd best album of 2008\\", and it peaked at number 126 on the Billboard 200. Johansson started listening to Waits when she was 11 or 12 years old, and said of him, \\"His melodies are so beautiful, his voice is so distinct and I had my own way of doing Tom Waits songs.\\" In September 2009, Johansson and singer-songwriter Pete Yorn released a collaborative album, Break Up, inspired by Serge Gainsbourg's duets with Brigitte Bardot.

So, we have a tiny puzzle here, let's solve it together. We want to figure out what 's' is. First, let's look at the equation: -201*s + 12038 = 22088. Imagine, you have -201 apples (those are some funny negative apples, huh!) multiplied by 's' plus 12038 candy bars, and all together they make 22088 candy bars. We want to find out how many such magic apples we have and for this we need to get rid of candies first! To do that we subtract 12038 candies from both sides. So we get: -201*s = 22088 - 12038. If you subtract 12038 from 22088, you get 10050! So now, we have -201*s = 10050. Now, to find out how many negative apples (our 's') we have, we're going to divide each side by -201. So: s = 10050 / -201 Once you do that, you find out that 's' equals to -50. So, what was 's'? It's negative 50!

Question: which is the largest sun in the universe?? Answer:","completion":"The term \\"largest sun\\" could be interpreted as the largest star in the universe. Stars are often referred to as \\"suns\\" when they serve as the central massive object around which planets and other celestial bodies revolve. Our own star, the Sun, is an example of this. The concept of the \\"largest\\" star is somewhat ambiguous, as it could refer to the most massive or physically largest star known. Generally, stars with more mass tend to be larger in size, but there are exceptions. Furthermore, our knowledge of the universe is limited, and we can only identify the largest or most massive stars within the observable universe. There may be even larger or more massive stars waiting to be discovered. The largest known star (by volume) is UY Scuti, a red supergiant located about 9,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Scutum. It is about 1,708 times the size of our Sun, which means that if placed at its center, its outer surface would extend beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Keep in mind that the physical size of a star is not necessarily proportional to its mass, and UY Scuti has a relatively modest mass of roughly 30 times that of our Sun. However, if we consider the most massive star, R136a1 takes the title. It is a Wolf-Rayet star, which is an extremely hot, luminous, and massive star nearing the end of its life. Located about 165,000 light-years away in the R136 open cluster in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud, R136a1 has an estimated mass of around 315 times the mass of the Sun, making it the most massive star we currently know of. It is physically smaller than UY Scuti, but its immense mass means it has a much larger influence on its surroundings due to its strong gravitational pull. It's important to note that our understanding of the universe is constantly evolving, and new discoveries are made regularly. As telescopes and detection methods improve, it is entirely possible that we may identify even larger or more massive stars in the future. Consequently, UY Scuti and R136a1 hold the titles of the \\"largest\\" and \\"most massive\\" stars known only within the observable universe based on our current level of knowledge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, for the 3rd straight week, the team would trail a game as the Raiders moved ahead after Sebastian Janikowski's 53-yard field goal for the only score of the first quarter. The Falcons however took the lead with Matt Ryan finding Roddy White on a 4-yard pass to move up 7-3. However, the Raiders would come within a point with Janikowski kicking a 22-yard field goal and then retook the lead with Carson Palmer's 25-yard touchdown pass to Denarius Moore for a 13-7 halftime lead. After the break, the Falcons were able to score 13 unanswered points. First, Bryant kicked 2 field goals from 41 and 20 yards tie the game at 13-13. Then, In the fourth quarter, they took the lead after Asante Samuel returned an interception from 79 yards out for a touchdown to make the score 20-13. The Raiders however were able to make up for this mistake as Carson Palmer drove them down the field and Darren McFadden ran a touchdown in from 2 yards out to tie the game at 20-20. However, again the Falcons were able to complete the comeback as Bryant nailed a 55-yard field goal with 0:01 left to make the final score 23-20 With the win, the Falcons go into their bye week with their first ever 6-0 start to a season. They also finish the season 4-0 against the AFC West and with the Texans' loss to the Packers on Sunday Night, they remain the NFL's only undefeated team. Question: How many total yards did Bryant have? Answer:","completion":"In the game described, Matt Bryant made three field goals for the Falcons. The distances of these field goals were 41 yards, 20 yards, and 55 yards. To find the total number of yards, we simply add the distances together: 41 yards + 20 yards + 55 yards = 116 yards So, Matt Bryant had a total of 116 yards in this game."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

From respiratory conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to cardiovascular complications and even cancer, the human health impacts of poor air quality are manifold and can even be life-threatening. The reduction in indoor and outdoor air quality results mostly from human activities. Outdoor air pollution is predominantly caused by the burning of fossil fuels by industries and automobiles. This leads to the release of harmful particles and gases such as Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM). Indoor air quality, on the other hand, can be affected by various factors including but not limited to cigarette smoke, mold, use of household chemicals, radon, and even outdoor air pollutants that find their way inside our homes and buildings. The public's increased awareness of the risks associated with air pollution is a critical step towards implementing effective solutions. This is because it's through this heightened awareness that individuals, societies, and governments can then act accordingly to mitigate the effects of air pollution. Protective measures can be personal, societal, or regulatory. Personal measures include things like reducing vehicle usage, avoiding burning trash, using less energy at home, and not smoking, especially indoors. On a societal level, measures can include collective efforts to plant more trees, cleaner urban planning, promoting public transportation, and raising broader awareness about the impacts of air pollution. Finally, regulatory measures are policies and regulations put in place by governments to control the emissions of harmful pollutants. This can include setting air quality standards, regulating industrial emissions, promoting clean energy sources, and implementing strict vehicle emission standards. Overall, increased public awareness regarding the effects of reduced air quality is pivotal for the protection of public health and the environment. Therefore, it's crucial for everyone to understand the sources and impacts of air pollution and take on protective measures, contributing to cleaner air and ultimately a healthier planet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Associated Press) In this image provided by Morton County Sheriff’s Department, law enforcement and protesters clash near the site of the Dakota Access pipeline on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, in Cannon Ball, N.D. The clash came as protesters sought to push past a bridge on a state highway that had been blockaded since late... (Associated Press) BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said Friday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to close an area where people have been camping for months to protest the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Dave Archambault said in a statement that he received a letter from the Corps, dated Friday, which says all lands north of the Cannonball River will be closed Dec. 5. \\"The letter states that the lands will be closed to public access for safety concerns,\\" Archambault said. Representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers didn't immediately return messages Friday seeking comment and verification of the letter. The letter, provided by the tribe, says: \\"To be clear, this means that no member of the general public, to include Dakota Access pipeline protesters, can be on these Corps lands.\\" It says anyone on land north of the river after Dec. 5 will be trespassing and may be prosecuted. It also says anyone who stays on the land does so at his or her own risk. The letter, from Army Corps of Engineers Col. John Henderson, says the closure is necessary to protect the general public from violent confrontations between protesters and authorities and to protect demonstrators from illness, injury or death during North Dakota's harsh winter months. It also says that the area does not have necessary first responder services or facilities to protect people during the winter. A free speech zone will be set up south of the river. Archambault said the land to be closed includes the Oceti Sakowin camp, a sprawling encampment on Army Corps land about 50 miles south of Bismarck. For months, opponents of the four-state, 3.8 billion pipeline have been camping in the area to protest the pipeline. Some of the protests have resulted in violent confrontations and hundreds of arrests. A clash earlier this week near the main protest camp left a police officer and several protesters injured, including Sophia Wilansky, who suffered a serious arm injury and is in satisfactory condition in a Minneapolis hospital. The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes are fighting the Dakota Access project because they fear it will harm drinking water and cultural sites. Pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners disputes that and says the 1,200-mile pipeline through the Dakotas, Iowa and Illinois will be safe. The pipeline is nearly complete outside of a stretch beneath a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota, just to the north of the Standing Rock reservation. \\"Our Tribe is deeply disappointed in this decision by the United States, but our resolve to protect our water is stronger than ever,\\" he said. He's asking pipeline opponents to continue to fight the pipeline's permitting process. Meanwhile, the leader of the Cheyenne River Sioux in South Dakota called for pipeline opponents to boycott businesses in North Dakota's capital, a move Bismarck's city administrator says is uncalled for and disappointing. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Council voted in September to not spend money in Bismarck and neighboring Mandan, and Chairman Harold Frazier at the time called on all tribal members to join the effort. Earlier this week, he sought to broaden the boycott to make a statement against what he calls \\"heavy-handed, illegal and violent oppression\\" of people who have protested against the pipeline for months. Bismarck City Administrator Keith Hunke said Friday the boycott is disappointing given that the city's businesses aren't involved in the dispute. He said no businesses have reported an impact from boycotts and protest activity in the area is inconvenient, but hasn't cut into business's bottom lines. \\"We've had some of our streets blocked for a period of time, but generally after a period of time the protesters disband and business gets back to normal,\\" he said. More than 560 protesters have been arrested since August in the Bismarck-Mandan area and at the main protest camp, including more than 30 at a Bismarck mall on Friday — one of the busiest days of the year. Police said protesters gathered for a prayer at Kirkwood Mall, and some refused to leave the entrance to a Target store when ordered. __ Forliti reported from Minneapolis. Follow her on Twitter at: http://www.twitter.com/amyforliti. ___ Follow Blake Nicholson on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/NicholsonBlake ||||| Protesters against the North Dakota Access oil pipeline said Saturday they will not move from the site of a months-long encampment, even after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a letter announcing its plan to close the land. The protesters, or “water protectors,” were notified that land north of the Cannonball River will be closed on Dec. 5, according to Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. RELATED LINKS The Oceti Sakowin camp, which rests on the banks of the river, contains a loose collective of tribal nations and out-of-state supporters opposing the 1,172-mile pipeline. The camp is about 45 minutes south of Bismarck, the state capital. Archambault said he was “deeply disappointed” by the Army Corps’ decision, “but our resolve to protect our water is stronger than ever.” “It is both unfortunate and disrespectful that this announcement comes the day after this country celebrates Thanksgiving — a historic exchange of goodwill between Native Americans and the first immigrants from Europe,” Archambault wrote. “Although the news is saddening, it is not at all surprising given the last 500 years of the mistreatment of our people.” The Army Corps did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its supporters have said the 3.7-billion pipeline threatens the reservation’s main water supply and cultural artifacts, all claims the company behind the project, Energy Transfer Partners, has denied. Archambault said the Army Corps closed public access to the land over “safety concerns,” adding that the agency plans to allow a “free-speech zone” south of the Cannonball River. Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, posted what appeared to be the Army Corps’ statement on Facebook. The decision comes days after law enforcement deployed water hoses, rubber bullets and tear gas against hundreds of unarmed Standing Rock protesters. Camp organizers said more than 300 protesters were injured in Sunday’s standoff, and 26 were hospitalized. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the Morton County Sheriff’s Department and other law enforcement’s response in the encounter, saying it was a “catastrophe with serious human rights implications.” The sheriff’s department defended the decision to douse protesters in freezing temperatures, saying that protesters were “very aggressive.” An initial statement from the department said it was an “ongoing riot.” Energy Transfer CEO Kelcy Warren told the NewsHour that the pipeline was built “to have minimal impact to all people concerned,” adding that “we’re building the pipeline.” READ MORE: For Native �?water protectors,’ Standing Rock protest has become fight for religious freedom, human rights New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker on Friday called on Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Department of Justice to investigate tactics that police are using against protesters at Standing Rock. “I call on the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to promptly and thoroughly investigate all credible reports of inappropriate police tactics and, if DOJ has not already done so, to send federal monitors to Standing Rock to ensure that protesters can peacefully assemble and exercise their First Amendment rights,” he wrote. |||||","completion":"The US Army Corps of Engineers plans to close an area in North Dakota where people have been gathering to protest the proposed Dakota Access oil pipeline on Monday, December 5.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Javier Adelmar Zanetti was born in Buenos Aires with Italian origins to working-class parents and grew up in the harbour area in the Dock Sud district, one of the city's most notorious areas. His father Rodolfo was a bricklayer and his mother Violeta Bonnazola was a cleaner. He began playing football on a field in the city suburbs, maintaining the pitch in his spare time. When he was a teenager, he tried out for local club Independiente's youth academy but was ultimately rejected and told that he lacked the physique to succeed in the game. After the arrival of Maicon at the beginning of the 2006-07 season, Zanetti was moved from the right-back position into midfield. He ended a four-year goal drought when he scored on 5 November 2006 at a home match against Ascoli, having previously scored on 6 November 2002 at an away match against Empoli. On 27 September 2006, against Bayern Munich, Zanetti played his 500th professional match for Inter and on 22 November 2006, he appeared in his 100th UEFA match, against Sporting Clube de Portugal. Zanetti celebrated his 600th match for Inter on 24 September 2008 with a 1-0 win over newly promoted Lecce. Minutes before the match, he was presented with a commemorative plate by former vice-captain Ivan Cordoba to mark the occasion. Though Zanetti is more often classified as a defender, he played mostly in midfield during the first half of the 2008-09 season. For the last several weeks of October 2008, with Inter coach Jose Mourinho facing a midfield crisis due to injuries to key midfielders Esteban Cambiasso and Sulley Muntari, he was moved again to the midfield for the matches against Genoa and Fiorentina. During that period, Mourinho played him in the midfield due to the presence of Maicon, Lucio, Walter Samuel and Cristian Chivu in the back four. The 2009-10 season began well for Zanetti and Inter, especially after a 4-0 thrashing of crosstown rivals Milan in the Derby della Madonnina. In the match against Genoa on 17 October, he started off the counter-attack that led to Inter's second goal after dispossessing a Genoa player. Inter became the first team of the season to win by a five-goal margin. On 24 October, he reached Giacinto Facchetti's record of 476 Serie A appearances when he turned out for the match against Catania, which ended in a 2-1 win for the Nerazzurri. He also currently holds a club record of 149 consecutive appearances. Inter won the 2010 Champions League final 2-0 against Bayern Munich on 22 May 2010. This was Zanetti's 700th appearance for Inter, and it made him the first player to captain an Italian club to a treble of the Scudetto, Coppa Italia and Champions League. Did he win a lot","completion":"Yes, Javier Zanetti won a lot in his football career. For example, during the 2009-2010 season, he helped his team, Inter, win three big titles: the Italian Championship (Scudetto), the Italian Cup (Coppa Italia), and the European Championship (Champions League). He was the first captain of an Italian club to win all three in the same season!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who used a Fender Stratocaster during the recording of the Help! , can you please find it? When Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 his main guitar was a Höfner President Acoustic, which he soon traded for a Höfner Club 40 model. His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso. The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models, played through a Vox amplifier, including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961, and posed with on the album cover for Cloud Nine. He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he played on \\"She Loves You\\", and during the Beatles' 1964 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1963 he bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo, and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, which was the second of its kind to be manufactured. Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and first used it during the recording of the Help! album that February; he also used it when recording Rubber Soul later that year, most notably on the song \\"Nowhere Man\\".In early 1966 Harrison and Lennon each purchased Epiphone Casinos, which they used on Revolver. Harrison also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album. He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word \\"Bebopalula\\" above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, \\"Rocky\\", on the headstock. He played this guitar in the Magical Mystery Tour film and throughout his solo career. In July 1968, Clapton gave him a Gibson Les Paul, which Harrison nicknamed \\"Lucy\\". Around this time, he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200 acoustic guitar, which he subsequently gave to Dylan to use at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival. In late 1968 Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype, made especially for him by Philip Kubicki. In August 2017, Fender released a \\"Limited Edition George Harrison Rosewood Telecaster\\" modelled after a Telecaster that Roger Rossmeisl originally created for Harrison.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation? St Botolph's Church is an Anglican place of worship in the village of Quarrington, part of the civil parish of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, England. The area has been settled since at least the Anglo-Saxon period, and a church existed at Quarrington by the time Domesday was compiled in 1086, when it formed part of Ramsey Abbey's fee. It was granted to Haverholme Priory about 1165, and the Abbey claimed the right to present the rector in the 13th century. This right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century, and then passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50. Recognised for its age and tracery, the church has been designated a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle ending at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the reticulated designs.

Background: Me and Orson Welles is a 2008 British-American period drama film directed by Richard Linklater and starring Zac Efron, Christian McKay, and Claire Danes. Based on Robert Kaplow's novel of the same name, the story, set in 1937 New York, tells of a teenager hired to perform in Orson Welles's groundbreaking stage adaptation of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. He becomes attracted to a career-driven production assistant. The film was shot in London and New York and on the Isle of Man in February, March and April 2008, and was released in the United States on November 25, 2009, and the United Kingdom on December 4, 2009. Context: Select footage of Me and Orson Welles was screened at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival where financing and sales agency Cinetic Media were looking to sell the film to a distributor. Before its Cannes premiere, The Hollywood Reporter predicted that the film would attract distributors with Linklater's resume and Efron's teen \\"heartthrob\\" status to appeal to a younger demographic, but Me and Orson Welles failed to secure any American acquisitions. Its first full screening was at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, running September 4-13, 2008. In spite of its failure to find a buyer at Cannes, Toronto's co-director Cameron Bailey predicted that it would be \\"one of the hottest films\\" in the lineup, Anne Thompson of Variety magazine also believed that the film would be one of \\"only a few lucky winners\\" to secure a seven-figure deal. Again, however, the film's distribution rights were not purchased and it went on to show at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. In May 2009, production company CinemaNX announced that it would distribute Me and Orson Welles itself, sharing marketing and advertising costs with Vue Entertainment. Freestyle Releasing was hired as the US distributor with Hart/Lunsford Pictures in exchange for participation in revenues paid the 4 million prints and advertising cost. It was screened at the Woodstock Film Festival in September 2009, where Linklater was honored as the winner of the 2009 Maverick Award. it opened the New Orleans Film Festival on October 9, 2009; and it was screened at the St. Louis International Film Festival in November 2009. The film was released in the US on November 25, 2009, and in the UK on December 4, 2009. IndieWIRE reported, \\"The do-it-yourself release of Richard Linklater's Me and Orson Welles got off to a very nice start, averaging 15,910 from its four theaters, the highest PTA of all debuting films. ... While Orson Welles is one the first examples of such a high-profile film going to the DIY route, if it proves successful, it's going to be done a lot more in the future.\\" Question: How much money did Me and Orson Welles make at the box office?.

Veronica, already predisposed to dislike her new daughter-in-law, is further disappointed to find that she, like Jim, speaks fluent French. Larita also meets John's former girlfriend and neighbour Sarah Hurst, who is gracious about the marriage.

Lithium toxicity can occur if you take only slightly more than a recommended dose. In the context of the sentence, it's stated that patients were taking lithium for maintenance therapy of their manic-depressive disorder. However, they developed transient episodes of thyrotoxicosis, which is a condition characterized by an excessive amount of thyroid hormones in the body. Lithium is known to affect thyroid function and can cause different types of thyroid disorders. While lithium is effective in managing mood disorders, its administration needs careful monitoring due to its potential side effects, which in this case manifested as thyrotoxicosis in the patients who also had underlying autoimmune thyroiditis. This may require careful consideration and monitoring in the medical management of patients with similar conditions. Their healthcare provider may need to adjust their treatment plan, medication, or the dosage of lithium they are receiving."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, the premise focuses on observing the action, while the hypothesis seems to suggest that the actions of an Indian person can reveal their emotional responses. Step 6: Evaluate if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise If the premise is true, it is suggesting that observation of the events or actions can help us learn about Indian people's emotional responses. The hypothesis proposes that the actions of an Indian person can tell us about their emotional responses. While both the premise and the hypothesis are related, the hypothesis seems to focus on the actions of an individual Indian person, while the premise talks about observing actions/events in general. Conclusion: The hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, but they are related. If the premise is true that observing actions can help learn about Indian people's emotional responses, the actions of an individual Indian person might provide some insights into their emotional responses, but the hypothesis is not a direct logical consequence of the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On a day it celebrated 50 years of giving free legal advice, Southern Arizona Legal Aid announced it has received two grants totaling more than 7 million. One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits.

(Associated Press) RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The city of Norfolk has agreed to pay 4.9 million to four former sailors who were wrongly convicted of a woman's rape and murder based on intimidating police interrogations. A copy of the settlement agreement for the \\"Norfolk Four\\" was obtained by The Associated Press. The state also has agreed to pay 3.5 million. The payments close out a decades-long case that drew widespread attention as the men's innocence claims were backed by dozens of former FBI agents, ex-prosecutors and crime novelist John Grisham. \\"These guys can now put all this behind them and try to recoup their lives,\\" said Tony Troy, a lawyer who represented one of the sailors. The men — Eric Wilson, Danial Williams, Joseph Dick and Derek Tice — were pardoned by then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe last year of the 1997 rape and murder of Michelle Moore-Bosko. Moore-Bosko's husband found her stabbed and strangled body in their apartment in July of that year after returning from a week at sea. Williams, who lived in the same building, was quickly identified as a suspect because a neighbor told police he had a crush on the victim. Williams admitted to her rape and murder — the first of a series of confessions that the men, then-sailors at the Naval base in Norfolk, say were forced by police. DNA evidence matched only one person: Omar Ballard, the fifth man convicted in the case. Ballard, who pleaded guilty in 2000, acknowledged he was solely responsible and is serving a life sentence. The Norfolk Four have said they cracked after they were threatened with the death penalty and repeatedly called liars. One of the men recalled a detective shoving him into a corner and showing him a picture of Moore-Bosko's bloody body. The confessions conflicted with one another. Ballard's account was the only one containing information matching the crime scene. The detective who questioned them, Robert Glenn Ford, was convicted in 2011 of extortion and lying to the FBI in unrelated cases. In vacating some of the Norfolk Four's convictions, a federal judge once declared that \\"no sane human being\\" could find them guilty. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam approved legislation earlier this year that gives the men 3.5 million in state funds contingent on them resolving claims against the city. Sen. Scott Surovell, a sponsor the legislation, said he was pleased that the city agreed to settle rather than fight the men. \\"Justice was long overdue for these four, what happened to them was outrageous and undermines faith in our criminal justice system,\\" he said. \\"Hopefully this settlement will help ensure this never happens again.\\" The settlement with the city was finalized a month ago but had not been previously made public. A city spokeswoman referred questions to the City Attorney Bernard Pishko, who did not immediately return requests for comment. The false convictions took a heavy toll on the four men, including lengthy prison terms and years as registered sex offenders. Wilson, who was wrongly convicted of rape, said it took an attorney and 10,000 to persuade a board to grant him an electrician's license and that he was blocked from working on certain properties, such as schools, and barred from city parks. He also said his son was run out of his Cub Scout troop because other parents didn't want Wilson around.

Article: Travelling abroad for leisure is becoming more and more popular for Chinese. The UK is high up in the list of places that the Chinese want to visit. There is a sense of mystery about the UK; it's often the images of England's green parks, countryside and Victorian houses that people point to as an alternative to polluted, overcrowded cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou. The capital is viewed as modern and dynamic, while being filled deep with history. When asked what other images are thought of by the UK, the reply is often \\"the Queen, tea and Oxbridge\\". So what's stopping them actually coming? Sebastian Wood ,the British ambassador in Beijing, has described the UK as a _ , and while this is perhaps an exaggeration ,Britain does have a reputation as a country that is harder to access. The main problem for Chinese tourists is obvious. Although visa applications are now completed online, visitors are still required to visit one of 12 UK centers across the country for a face-to-face interview and fingerprinting. If you don't live near one of these enters already, you'd have to travel some distance to get there. Another problem is also to be mentioned. If travelers from China visit the UK, they also want to cover as much ground as possible. But the UK is not included in the Schengen visa, which allows access to a host of 26 European countries such as France and Germany. So it makes the former seem a less worth it. There is also the issue of cost: PS47 for a Schengen visa, PS82 for the UK. On top of this, the UK is viewed as stricter in its handing of visas compared with the rest of Europe, fed by urban legends of rejected applications. In the end, the decision comes down to one question: Is Britain worth a visit? Question: What is the writer's attitude towards visiting the UK? Options: A: He really supports Chinese people to visit the UK. B: He suggests Chinese people visit London strongly. C: He thinks it is troublesome to visit the UK.

Determine which suffix to use - \\"-ance\\" or \\"-ence.\\" To decide which suffix to use, consider the general rule that \\"-ance\\" is added to verbs ending with a consonant and \\"-ence\\" is for verbs ending with \\"e.\\" Some verbs depend on the root word and may not follow this rule. 3. Change the verb to a noun by adding the appropriate suffix. Following the general rule, the verb \\"influence\\" ends with \\"e,\\" so the suffix \\"-ence\\" is appropriate. Adding the suffix results in the noun \\"influence.\\" 4. Verify if the newly formed noun is correct and in common use. Make sure the noun is grammatically correct and commonly used in the English language. It's helpful to check dictionaries and online resources to confirm the validity of the noun. - In our example, \\"influence\\" is already a valid noun and doesn't require a suffix. This shows that some words don't need to be changed to become a valid noun. For instance, the verb \\"perform\\" becomes the noun \\"performance\\" by adding the suffix \\"-ance.\\" 5. Practice converting verbs to nouns. To become proficient in this skill, practice converting various verbs to nouns using the suffixes \\"-ance\\" and \\"-ence.\\" This will help solidify your understanding of when and how to use these suffixes correctly. 6.

In this sentence, the UNHCR, the United Nation's agency that is devoted to refugee matters, is suggesting that one of the reasons for a 13% increase on an annual basis in the given context is partially because there has been a growth in the number of individuals from China and Mexico seeking asylum. Asylum seekers are typically people who are seeking international protection but whose claim for refugee status has not yet been determined. Therefore, they are looking to be recognized as refugees and receive legal protection and material assistance from the UNHCR. In order to understand this assertion more fully, it is necessary to know that an increase in asylum seekers from a particular country can often reflect socio-political conditions in that country, such as unrest, conflict, or persecution, causing citizens to flee and seek protection under refugee status in other countries. Thus, the statement implicates that there has likely been such a situation in China and Mexico causing an influx of asylum seekers from these countries. However, this sentence does not provide details about what exactly the 13% annual increase refers to. It might be referring to an overall global increase in asylum seekers or refugees, or perhaps an increase in a specific country or region. Those details could provide more context to understand the scale and impact of the increase in Chinese and Mexican asylum seekers.

She turns out to be one of Dr. Evil's fembots, who attempts to kill Austin, then self-destructs. Austin grieves briefly, then proceeds to the hotel lobby nude and celebrates being single again. A NATO monitoring facility observes the return of Dr. Evil, confronting his son Scott, and then starting a riot, on The Jerry Springer Show, and informs British intelligence. At Dr. Evil's Seattle headquarters, Dr. Evil is presented with a one-eighth-size clone of himself whom he calls Mini-Me. Dr. Evil unveils his latest evil plan: he has developed a time machine to go back to the 1960s and steal Austin's mojo, the source of Austin's sexual appeal. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me go back to 1969 and meet a younger Number Two and Frau Farbissina. An obese \\"Scottish Guard\\" called Fat Bastard extracts Austin's mojo from his frozen body at the Ministry of Defence Cryo Chamber. British intelligence warns Austin that one of Dr. Evil's agents is after him, and during a photo shoot the wanton Ivana Humpalot seduces him, but at the last moment she claims he is too sexy for her to kill him. They have sex in his bed, but do not get far before he discovers that he has lost his mojo and is impotent.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.

The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.

A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a title for this article: Are you a global warming skeptic? There are plenty of good reasons why you might be. As many as 757 stations in the United States recorded net surface-temperature cooling over the past century. Many are concentrated in the southeast, where some people attribute tornadoes and hurricanes to warming. The temperature-station quality is largely awful. The most important stations in the U.S. are included in the Department of Energy's Historical Climatology Network. A careful survey of these stations by a team led by meteorologist Anthony Watts showed that 70% of these stations have such poor siting that, by the U.S. government's own measure, they result in temperature uncertainties of between two and five degrees Celsius or more. We do not know how much worse are the stations in the developing world. Using data from all these poor stations, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates an average global 0.64ºC temperature rise in the past 50 years, \\"most\\" of which the IPCC says is due to humans. Yet the margin of error for the stations is at least three times larger than the estimated warming. We know that cities show anomalous warming, caused by energy use and building materials; asphalt, for instance, absorbs more sunlight than do trees. Tokyo's temperature rose about 2ºC in the last 50 years. Could that rise, and increases in other urban areas, have been unreasonably included in the global estimates? That warming may be real, but it has nothing to do with the greenhouse effect and can't be addressed by carbon dioxide reduction. Moreover, the three major temperature analysis groups (the U.S.'s NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.K.'s Met Office and Climatic Research Unit) analyze only a small fraction of the available data, primarily from stations that have long records. There's a logic to that practice, but it could lead to selection bias. For instance, older stations were often built outside of cities but today are surrounded by buildings. These groups today use data from about 2,000 stations, down from roughly 6,000 in 1970, raising even more questions about their selections. On top of that, stations have moved, instruments have changed and local environments have evolved. Analysis groups try to compensate for all this by homogenizing the data, though there are plenty of arguments to be had over how best to homogenize long-running data taken from around the world in varying conditions. These adjustments often result in corrections of several tenths of one degree Celsius, significant fractions of the warming attributed to humans. And that's just the surface-temperature record. What about the rest? The number of named hurricanes has been on the rise for years, but that's in part a result of better detection technologies (satellites and buoys) that find storms in remote regions. The number of hurricanes hitting the U.S., even more intense Category 4 and 5 storms, has been gradually decreasing since 1850. The number of detected tornadoes has been increasing, possibly because radar technology has improved, but the number that touch down and cause damage has been decreasing. Meanwhile, the short-term variability in U.S. surface temperatures has been decreasing since 1800, suggesting a more stable climate. Without good answers to all these complaints, global-warming skepticism seems sensible. But now let me explain why you should not be a skeptic, at least not any longer. Over the last two years, the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Project has looked deeply at all the issues raised above. I chaired our group, which just submitted four detailed papers on our results to peer-reviewed journals. We have now posted these papers online at www.BerkeleyEarth.org to solicit even more scrutiny. Our work covers only land temperature—not the oceans—but that's where warming appears to be the greatest. Robert Rohde, our chief scientist, obtained more than 1.6 billion measurements from more than 39,000 temperature stations around the world. Many of the records were short in duration, and to use them Mr. Rohde and a team of esteemed scientists and statisticians developed a new analytical approach that let us incorporate fragments of records. By using data from virtually all the available stations, we avoided data-selection bias. Rather than try to correct for the discontinuities in the records, we simply sliced the records where the data cut off, thereby creating two records from one. We discovered that about one-third of the world's temperature stations have recorded cooling temperatures, and about two-thirds have recorded warming. The two-to-one ratio reflects global warming. The changes at the locations that showed warming were typically between 1-2ºC, much greater than the IPCC's average of 0.64ºC. To study urban-heating bias in temperature records, we used satellite determinations that subdivided the world into urban and rural areas. We then conducted a temperature analysis based solely on \\"very rural\\" locations, distant from urban ones. The result showed a temperature increase similar to that found by other groups. Only 0.5% of the globe is urbanized, so it makes sense that even a 2ºC rise in urban regions would contribute negligibly to the global average. What about poor station quality? Again, our statistical methods allowed us to analyze the U.S. temperature record separately for stations with good or acceptable rankings, and those with poor rankings (the U.S. is the only place in the world that ranks its temperature stations). Remarkably, the poorly ranked stations showed no greater temperature increases than the better ones. The mostly likely explanation is that while low-quality stations may give incorrect absolute temperatures, they still accurately track temperature changes. When we began our study, we felt that skeptics had raised legitimate issues, and we didn't know what we'd find. Our results turned out to be close to those published by prior groups. We think that means that those groups had truly been very careful in their work, despite their inability to convince some skeptics of that. They managed to avoid bias in their data selection, homogenization and other corrections. Global warming is real. Perhaps our results will help cool this portion of the climate debate. How much of the warming is due to humans and what will be the likely effects? We made no independent assessment of that.

Article: In a broad sense, \\"sin\\" refers to anything that falls short of the holiness of God. The easiest to spot are usually actions, but sins can also include thoughts and attitudes. Certain actions are considered sins, but the desire to perform those actions is sinful, as well. For instance, wanting to commit adultery is a sin just as actually committing adultery is. Temptation is not a sin, though. If you're put in a compromising situation with someone you find physically attractive, you may feel tempted to act on that attraction. Actually acting on that attraction and committing adultery as a result, or imagining the act of committing adultery even without doing it, is the sin. Simply feeling tempted to do so is not. Even though mankind was created in the image of God, the fall of Adam and Eve—the first humans—signified the fall of all humanity. As a result, humans are sinful by their very nature. In other words, you don't have to be taught how to sin. Sin is already firmly fixed inside of you at the very core of your being from the time of your birth. When Jesus died on the cross, He carried the sins of humanity with Him. Christ's sacrifice canceled out the debt of original sin. In the Old Testament, animal sacrifices were used as a way to repent for the sins of flesh. Even these sacrifices were imperfect, though, so the stain of original sin still remained. As both Son of God and Son of Man, Jesus became the “perfect sacrifice,” capable of freeing the human soul from the chains and punishment of original sin. \\" Accepting Christ and being freed from sin does not mean that you will never do another wicked thing ever again. Christ's sacrifice freed your spirit from the shackles of sin. Your flesh—including your body, mind, and heart—will still have to deal with everyday sin. Your soul can be free from sin even though your body still sins. Being free from sin on a soul level should mean that you also seek freedom from sin on a physical level, though, even though it can never be permanently reached. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article discusses the concept of \\"sin\\" as actions, thoughts, and attitudes that fall short of the holiness of God.

However, while one's soul may be free from sin through accepting Christ, the body, mind, and heart will continue to grapple with everyday sins.

Q: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...

Movie title: Brotherhood of the Wolf Context: The film begins during the French Revolution, with the aged Marquis d'Apcher as the narrator, writing his memoirs in a castle, while the voices of a mob can be heard from outside. The film flashes back to 1764,[8] when a mysterious beast terrorized the province of GÃ©vaudan and nearby lands. GrÃ©goire de Fronsac, a knight and the royal naturalist of King Louis XV of France, and his Iroquois companion Mani, arrive in GÃ©vaudan to capture the beast. Upon arrival, they rescue Jean Chastel, an aged healer, and his daughter La Bavarde from an attack by soldiers. The young and enlightened ThomasâMarquis d'Apcherâlater befriends the two outsiders. Fronsac is initially skeptical about the beast's existence, since survivors describe it as much larger than any wolf he has ever seen. However, by studying the bite size on a victim of the beast, he deduces that it must weigh roughly 500Â lb (227Â kg). Captain Duhamel, an army officer leading the hunt for the beast, has killed dozens of ordinary wolves, but has not come close to the actual killer. While staying in GÃ©vaudan, Fronsac romances Marianne de Morangias, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean-FranÃ§ois, was also an avid hunter and a world traveler, before losing one arm to a lion in Africa. Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, an Italian courtesan at the local brothel. While investigating another victim, Fronsac finds a fang made of steel, which increases his doubts of the beast's existence. Another witness swears that the beast is controlled by a human master. Fronsac studies the patterns of the attacks and victims, trying to find a common thread and reveal a murderer. As the investigation proves to be unfruitful, the king's weapons master, Lord de Beauterne, arrives to put an end to the beast. However, instead of doing so, Beauterne kills an ordinary wolf and tells Fronsac to alter the corpse so it resembles the monster accordingly.

With proper spacing, the text should be written as, \\"Boosts Strength, Stamina, and Recuperation.\\" Now, allow me to provide a detailed explanation of these three attributes: 1. Strength: Strength refers to the physical power, typically in the context of muscles, with which an individual or item can exert force. It is a crucial component of overall physical fitness, as it is essential for completing tasks that require lifting, carrying, or pushing something. The ability to generate enough force to achieve such activities necessitates robust muscle groups that can efficiently contract and relax. Boosting one's strength often involves a combination of exercise, nutrition, and mental resilience. 2. Stamina: Stamina is the body's ability to endure prolonged periods of physical or mental exertion. It is an essential component of overall health, as it enables an individual to perform various activities effectively without succumbing to fatigue rapidly. Stamina is typically associated with aerobic fitness, such as running and cycling, but it can also pertain to anaerobic exercises like weight lifting. Boosting one's stamina usually involves a combination of cardiovascular exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, proper nutrition, and adequate rest to ensure optimal recovery and performance. 3. Recuperation: Recuperation refers to the process by which the body recovers from physical or mental stress. This process is vital, as it allows the body to repair and rebuild damaged muscles, replenish energy stores, and maintain overall health. Efficient recuperation also reduces the risk of injuries and illnesses resulting from overtraining or excessive stress on the body.Boosting one's recuperation usually involves proper rest, sound nutrition, stress management, and adequate hydration. In conclusion, the original text highlights the significance of boosting strength, stamina, and recuperation for overall health and well-being. A well-rounded fitness regimen, combined with a balanced diet and self-care habits, can enhance these three attributes and contribute to improved physical and mental performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he. For how long has the husband felt attracted to the same sex?

The word is originally an agentive noun of the Latin verb docēre (dɔˈkeːrɛ) 'to teach'. It has been used as an academic title in Europe since the 13th century, when the first doctorates were awarded at the University of Bologna and the University of Paris. Having become established in European universities, this usage spread around the world. Contracted \`\`Dr'' or \`\`Dr.'', it is used as a designation for a person who has obtained a Doctorate (e.g. PhD). In many parts of the world it is also used by medical practitioners, regardless of whether or not they hold a doctoral-level degree. Can we conclude that is a person with a phd a doctor?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that a person with a PhD is considered a doctor. This is because the term \\"doctor\\" is used to denote someone who has achieved the highest level of academic expertise in their field. A PhD, or Doctor of Philosophy, is typically the highest degree that can be awarded in various fields of study, such as humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and many other disciplines. Therefore, a person who has earned a PhD has demonstrated a deep understanding and mastery of their chosen subject, as well as the ability to conduct original research and contribute new knowledge to their field. When someone has earned a PhD, they are granted the title of \\"doctor,\\" which signifies their expertise and scholarly achievements. This title is used both within academia and in professional settings, as a form of respect and recognition for their accomplishments. It is important to note that the specific requirements and duration of a PhD program may vary, depending on the country, institution, and discipline. Generally, a PhD candidate is required to complete advanced coursework, carry out independent research, and write a dissertation that presents their findings to the academic community. However, it is also essential to understand that the term \\"doctor\\" is not exclusive to those who hold a PhD. As mentioned earlier, medical practitioners who may not necessarily hold a doctoral-level degree are often referred to as doctors. These professionals have completed medical school and earned degrees such as Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), which qualifies them to practice medicine. It is important to distinguish between medical doctors and those with a PhD, as their roles and expertise are different. In conclusion, a person with a PhD can indeed be referred to as a doctor, as this title recognizes their high level of academic achievement, knowledge, and expertise in their specific field. This usage is found around the world and across various disciplines, underscoring the importance and prestige associated with holding a doctoral degree. However, it is crucial to recognize that the title \\"doctor\\" can apply to both those with PhDs and medical practitioners, and one should be mindful of this distinction when addressing or referring to individuals with this title."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:The 39-year-old, from Cardiff, has endured several rounds of punishing IVF, two ectopic pregnancies resulting in surgery, and she is still no closer to finding out the cause of the problem. Here, in her own words, she talks about the couple's devastating losses, how attending a memorial service for one of their lost babies helped them grieve and why they are not giving hope just yet. That feeling of lying on the bed waiting for the scan with Andrew sat next to me holding my hand, I'm just watching the faces of the hospital staff for any signs. It's a feeling of \\"here we go again\\". We're so used to this now, it's 10 times. I've probably had every type of management of a miscarriage. I've had a D and C (dilation and curettage) where they remove the embryo through surgery, I've gone into hospital and had tablets which help it come away and I've just come home and waited for it to happen naturally. None is any easier than the other. We'd always wanted our own family. Andrew and I have been married for 10 years and got together about 10 years before that. But I wanted to get married first and we didn't get married until we were 29. So we were a bit late I suppose and started trying straight away then. We had our first miscarriage about six months later. Even now we don't know why they happen, we just keep being told it's bad luck. We started trying and caught straight away but I had a bleed and realised something wasn't right. We went to the hospital and were scanned quite early and had lots of blood tests and realised it had already gone. We were quite devastated the first time, all our friends were getting pregnant so it was quite heartbreaking. Because then you've got to see all your friends starting their families and having exactly what you want but can't have. We left it a couple of months and started trying again but it took us 18 months to get pregnant. We thought everything was fine the second time but at about 11 weeks, just before my three-month scan, I started to bleed. We went to the hospital and they could see that the sack had continued growing but the embryo had stopped growing at about six or seven weeks and there was no heartbeat. We were devastated and went to the doctors at that point and they sent us for some tests. They sent us to a consultant to look into it and he was more concerned that we hadn't got pregnant for 18 months. We had further tests - tests to check my tubes weren't blocked, tests for Andrew - which all came back pretty much clear and after another natural, but unsuccessful pregnancy, they put us on the route of IVF. It takes a few weeks, lots of injections lots of scans, lots of appointments. If anything, you've probably got more time to build your hopes up. When you get that positive pregnancy result and you wait for a scan, there's a couple of weeks of not knowing. But with IVF, at every stage it could go wrong. When they're collecting the eggs there may not be enough there, once they've collected them they might not be mature enough, then when they fertilise them you think \\"are they going to fertilise? Are they going to become embryos?\\" Then you've got to wait a couple of days for them to develop, \\"are they going to make that stage?\\" And then when they finally go back in it's \\"are they going take?\\" At every stage you're on edge, worrying, and then you've got a two-week wait to see if you're actually pregnant and that two weeks is just the worst. I had two rounds of IVF on the NHS, but one wasn't successful and the other resulted in a miscarriage at six or seven weeks - it's always around the same time. We begged and borrowed from family and saved every penny to have one round of IVF that we paid for. It was unsuccessful unfortunately and there were no extra embryos we could use. But we were fortunate that the clinic we used rang us and offered us a free round of treatment if we could fund the medication which was still quite expensive. Of three embryo transfers two were successful, one wasn't. I'm not sure what's worse - getting that positive result and then having a miscarriage or not getting that positive result at all. They're both equally heartbreaking. Finding out I'm pregnant is always slightly happy - having that positive pregnancy test is a lovely feeling but it's quickly followed by \\"oh, let's not get too excited, let's not get our hopes up, let's wait until we get our scans\\". You're secretly hoping everything will be ok, but not letting yourself get too attached to it. Not letting yourself think about setting up a nursery or buying buggies. I like to stay positive because I'm a positive person but also in the back of your mind you're thinking, \\"is it going to be all right this time?\\" There's always that hope but then there's always that niggling thought that it's probably not. You think as long as there's no bleeding or pain it might be ok this time, I might just get through it. But we've been there for each other. Through each time, one of us is strong and the other one can break down a bit. It brings the other one back up again. It has probably brought us closer. I would imagine a lot of people don't get through it because it's so hard. But we've never blamed each other. That's a big thing. You blame yourself but we've never blamed each other. My husband is amazing, he's there through every appointment, holding my hand, sat in the hospital waiting room - just whatever I need. And then there's been times when he's really bad and once I'm on my feet I do the same and pull him up. IVF is around Â£5,000 to Â£6,000 a time which adds to the stress. Especially as my last two pregnancies have been ectopic which resulted in surgery and losing a fallopian tube each time. With the first one I went into hospital thinking I was just having an appointment and within two or three hours I was being operated on which was quite scary. Sometimes they catch it early and they can save the tube but in my case the tube had ruptured which can be life-threatening. I was really lucky, it was keyhole surgery but afterwards you're trying to get over the operation so you're not really thinking about the loss of a child. The second time, the first suggestion when they thought it was ectopic was \\"shall we book you in for surgery and take the other tube?\\" As a woman who's not got any children yet, and still desperately wants them, I felt it was a little insensitive. But I suppose they were looking at what they needed to do. A couple of weeks after one of my ectopic pregnancies I had a phone call asking me if I had made funeral arrangements. I think in the haze of everything going on and needing surgery I must have ticked the box and said I wanted to arrange a funeral. I was quite shocked because it was an eight-week embryo and I didn't really think you could have a funeral for an eight-week embryo. I had to go to the bereavement office in the Heath hospital where I spoke to a lovely lady who told me that if the hospital deal with it there's a memorial service for anyone that's lost a child or lost an early pregnancy. My husband and I went and it was really lovely. I think it just really helped us think \\"yes, we have lost a child\\", it's not just an embryo. We'd lost all those hopes and dreams you have as soon as you get that positive pregnancy test. It's the first time I'd heard of it but it definitely helped. It was just me and my husband and one other couple there. It was only a short a service - about 10 minutes - but it just really helped to mark it. It was the chaplain that did the service and they just talked about your children being up in heaven. It wasn't majorly religious, it was quite comforting. Me and Andrew decided to mark it by going for a little meal, just the two of us, and talking. It was quite a nice thing to do and there's a memorial garden in the crematorium where you can go and lay flowers and spend time if you want as well. Despite all we've been through, we're not giving up yet. I want our baby. I want to look at a child and see my husband looking back up at me. I want that feeling - to feel it growing inside of me and all those things that you go through and at the moment I just can't give up hope for that. I'm sure there will come a time when I might feel differently, my age is against me now, I'm getting older. But at the moment I've got three embryos in storage, I know we won't be able to afford any more rounds of IVF so these three embryos are our last hope. I think that makes us almost put-off doing it because, while they're still there, we've still got hope for the future. That's the safety blanket and once that's gone, it's gone. Then you've got to really change your aspect on how you want to live your life. We might consider adoption, I think we've got a lot to give a child, so it's something we might consider later on but at the moment I can't think about it. I've still got to keep my hope. There's new things happening all the time and hopefully we will find the right thing that will help us and have a bit of good luck for a change. It's hard, but with the support of my husband and my family and my friends, we get through it. We keep focussed; I keep my eye on the prize. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"A 39-year-old woman from Cardiff has had many struggles trying to have a baby.

Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A radio format or programming format (not to be confused with broadcast programming) describes the overall content broadcast on a radio station. Radio formats are frequently employed as a marketing tool, and are subject to frequent change. Music radio, old time radio, all-news radio, sports radio, talk radio and weather radio describe the operation of different genres of radio format and each format can often be sub-divided into many specialty formats. - Public broadcasting includes radio, television and other electronic media outlets whose primary mission is public service. In much of the world, funding comes from the government, especially via annual fees charged on receivers. In the United States, public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources, but generally most financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses ranging from small shops to corporations, along with audience contributions via pledge drives. The great majority are operated as private not-for-profit corporations. - The radio spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 Hz to 3000 GHz (3 THz). Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range, called radio waves, are extremely widely used in modern technology, particularly in telecommunication. To prevent interference between different users, the generation and transmission of radio waves is strictly regulated by national laws, coordinated by an international body, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). - A fee is the price one pays as remuneration for rights or services. Fees usually allow for overhead, wages, costs, and markup. - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent agency of the United States government, created by Congressional statute (see and ) to regulate interstate communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. The FCC works towards six goals in the areas of broadband, competition, the spectrum, the media, public safety and homeland security, and modernizing itself. - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world. - A broadcast license is a type of spectrum license granting the licensee permission to use a portion of the radio frequency spectrum in a given geographical area for broadcasting purposes. The licenses generally include restrictions, which vary from band to band. - Pine Ridge (Lakota: \\"wazíbló\\") is a census-designated place (CDP) and the most populous community in Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 3,308 at the 2010 census. It is the tribal headquarters of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. - A census-designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as cities, towns, and villages for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated small community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, colonias located along the U.S. border with Mexico, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - The term non-commercial educational (NCE) applies to a radio station or TV station that does not accept on-air advertisements (TV ads or radio ads), as defined in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). NCE stations do not pay broadcast license fees for their non-profit uses of the radio spectrum. Stations which are almost always operated as NCE include public broadcasting, community radio, and college radio, as well as many religious broadcasting stations. - The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation (Wazí Aháha Oyáke in Lakota, also called Pine Ridge Agency) is an Oglala Lakota Native American reservation located in the U.S. state of South Dakota. Originally included within the territory of the Great Sioux Reservation, Pine Ridge was established in 1889 in the southwest corner of South Dakota on the Nebraska border. Today it consists of 3,468.85 sq mi (8,984.306 km) of land area and is the eighth-largest reservation in the United States, larger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined.

It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - Yasuhikotakia ( Mekong loaches ) is a genus of botiid loaches , many which are popular aquarium fish . It is named in honor of Japanese collector / researcher Dr. Yasuhiko Taki . This genus has been separated from the genus Botia in the paper by Maurice Kottelat in 2004 . Fishes of the genus Yasuhikotakia are found inhabiting river systems in Indochina such as the Mekong , Chao Phraya , and Mae Klong . - Botia (Indian loaches) is a genus of freshwater fish in the loach family (Botiidae). It was a large genus with about 20 species. In 2004 Maurice Kottelat proposed in his paper (along with the description of \\"Botia kubotai\\", see References below) to divide the genus into four related genera based on fish appearance and locality: - Botiidae is a family of cypriniform ray-finned fishes from South, Southeast, and East Asia. Until recently they were placed in the true loach family Cobitidae, until Maurice Kottelat revised the loaches and re-elevated this taxon to family rank in 2012. The family includes about 56 species. - A vivarium (Latin, literally for \\"place of life\\"; plural: \\"vivaria\\" or \\"vivariums\\") is an area, usually enclosed, for keeping and raising animals or plants for observation or research. Often, a portion of the ecosystem for a particular species is simulated on a smaller scale, with controls for environmental conditions. - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms. - An aquarium (plural: \\"aquariums\\" or \\"aquaria\\") is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in which water-dwelling plants or animals are kept and displayed. Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, aquatic reptiles such as turtles, and aquatic plants. The term, coined by English naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, combines the Latin root \\"aqua\\", meaning water, with the suffix \\"-arium\\", meaning \\"a place for relating to\\". The aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist Robert Warington, who explained that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as their numbers do not grow too large. The aquarium craze was launched in early Victorian England by Gosse, who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853, and published the first manual, \\"The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea\\" in 1854. - The Mekong is a trans-boundary river in Southeast Asia. It is the world's 12th-longest river and the 7th-longest in Asia. Its estimated length is , and it drains an area of , discharging of water annually. - A public aquarium (plural: \\"public aquaria\\" or \\" public aquariums\\") is the aquatic counterpart of a zoo, which houses living aquatic animal and plant specimens for public viewing. Most public aquariums feature tanks larger than those kept by home aquarists, as well as smaller tanks. Since the first public aquariums were built in the mid-19th century, they have become popular and their numbers have increased. Most modern accredited aquariums stress conservation issues and educating the public. - Maurice Kottelat (born 16 July 1957 in Delémont, Switzerland) is a Swiss ichthyologist specializing in Eurasian freshwater fishes.

News article: Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Boris Johnson has spoken out against Theresa May's plans for Brexit in a newspaper column Boris Johnson has savaged Theresa May's Brexit plans, saying they would leave the UK with \\"diddly squat\\" after the negotiations and hand the EU \\"victory\\". The ex-foreign secretary used his Daily Telegraph column to say the Chequers deal \\"means disaster\\" for Britain. Downing Street hit back, saying his article contained \\"no new ideas\\" and that \\"serious leadership with a serious plan\\" was needed. It comes after the EU's negotiator criticised the UK's proposals. The so-called Chequers deal was agreed by cabinet at the prime minister's country residence as the UK's preferred way forward in negotiations with Brussels. Mrs May's plan would see the UK agreeing a \\"common rulebook\\" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to maintain frictionless trade at the border. It also officially ends the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK, but the ECJ would continue to be \\"the interpreter of EU rules\\" that the UK has agreed to stick to. Critics say the deal will leave the UK tied to EU rules and prevent Britain from striking its own trade deals in years to come. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. The negotiations between the UK and EU have an informal deadline tied to a summit in October - although figures on both sides have said it could slip back to November. If the UK and the EU do reach a deal, MPs will then have to approve it - and BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described what happens if they reject it as a \\"great unknown\\". \\"Nobody can answer that question because it simply has not happened before,\\" she added. In his first intervention on the EU debate since quitting the government, Mr Johnson compared negotiations between Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Mr Barnier to a wrestling match. He wrote: \\"The whole thing is about as pre-ordained as a bout between Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy; and in this case, I am afraid, the inevitable outcome is a victory for the EU, with the UK lying flat on the canvas and 12 stars circling symbolically over our semi-conscious head.\\" Mr Johnson said negotiations based on the Chequers plan had so far seen the EU take \\"every important trick\\", adding: \\"The UK has agreed to hand over £40bn of taxpayers' money for two-thirds of diddly squat.\\" Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search He said by using the strategy - defended by Mrs May in the Sunday Telegraph over the weekend - the UK had \\"gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank\\". If it continued on the same path, Mr Johnson added, the government would \\"throw away most of the advantages of Brexit\\". Mr Johnson also accused some members of the government of using the issue of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland to \\"stop a proper Brexit\\", but added: \\"They have been rumbled.\\" The \\"scandal\\" around the border problem was \\"not that we have failed, but that we have not even tried\\", he added. Mr Johnson argued that a hard border would not be needed after Brexit - because people did not need to be checked due to the Common Travel Area and that any checks on goods could be done away from the border. In response, Mrs May's official spokesman said: \\"Boris Johnson resigned over Chequers. There's no new ideas in this article to respond to. \\"What we need at this time is serious leadership with a serious plan and that's exactly what the country has with this prime minister and this Brexit plan. \\"She is a serious prime minister and she has put forward serious proposals.\\" Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: \\"Typical Johnson. False promises. Then refusal to take responsibility for his own actions. It's always someone else's fault.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May speaks after 12-hour cabinet meeting at Chequers in July Meanwhile, in an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier criticised the Chequers deal, saying to agree to it would see \\"the end of the single market and the European project\\". He said plans for a \\"common rulebook\\" for goods but not services were not in the EU's interests, adding: \\"Our own ecosystem has grown over decades. You cannot play with it by picking pieces.\\" \\"The British have a choice,\\" he said. \\"They could stay in the single market, like Norway, which is also not a member of the EU - but they would then have to take over all the associated rules and contributions to European solidarity. It is your choice. \\"But if we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences. \\"Then all sorts of other third[-party] countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits.\\" Image copyright EPA Image caption Michel Barnier has previously expressed criticism about Mrs May's Chequers plan Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, one of Mrs May's allies, former First Secretary of State Damian Green, said it would be \\"difficult but not impossible\\" for the Chequers plan to win the support of MPs in the House of Commons. He said it was \\"absolutely certain\\" there was no Parliamentary majority for a so-called \\"hard Brexit\\" and challenged supporters of that option to come up with a proposal that could win the support of the House of Commons. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who resigned in protest at the Chequers plan, told ITV's Good Morning Britain Mrs May should not be replaced, because \\"we don't need any more turbulence right now\\". \\"What matters in all of this is not the personality politics, it's the outcome at the end,\\" he added. Responding to Mr Barnier's remarks, a government spokeswoman said of Chequers: \\"This proposal achieves a new balance of rights and obligations that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU while preserving the constitutional integrity of the UK. There is no other proposal that does that. \\"Our negotiating teams have upped the intensity, and we continue to move at pace to reach - as Mr Barnier says - an ambitious partnership, which will work in the mutual interests of citizens and businesses in the UK and in the EU.\\" On Sunday, Mrs May wrote that she was \\"confident\\" a \\"good deal\\" could be reached on Brexit. But she said it was right for the government to prepare for a no-deal scenario - even though this would create \\"real challenges for both the UK and the EU\\" in some sectors. ||||| FILE - In this Thursday, May 25, 2017 file photo British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, left, and Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrive for a meeting during the NATO summit of heads of state and...

Question: What is the name of the person who was one of five artists shortlisted by the Australian Government for a project to produce a public artwork celebrating the centenary of women's suffrage in Australia? Answer the above question based on the context below: Biographer Hannah Fink estimated that Oliver produced 290 works over a career of 22 years. Of these, public art works are Oliver's best known sculptures. These include Eyrie, created for Adelaide's Hyatt Hotel in 1993, and Magnolia and Palm, commissioned in 1999 by the Sydney Botanical Gardens, as part of the Sydney Sculpture Walk. That same year, Big Feathers was commissioned for the Queen Street Mall in Brisbane. It comprises two large feather-shaped forms suspended above the pedestrian precinct, representing \\"Queen Street's history of parades as well as the mall's connection between earth and sky\\".In 2000, Oliver's piece Entwine was a finalist in the inaugural Helen Lempriere National Sculpture Award, while in the following year, Oliver won the University of New South Wales inaugural sculpture commission competition, with her three-metre-high Globe. Other success followed, when Trace was selected for the National Gallery of Australia's 2002 National Sculpture Prize exhibition.In August 2002 she was one of five artists shortlisted by the Australian Government for a project to produce a public artwork celebrating the centenary of women's suffrage in Australia.By the 2000s most of Oliver's output constituted commissioned pieces, whether public or private. The most substantial of these is Vine, a 16.5 metre high sculpture installed as part of the 400 million refurbishment of the Sydney Hilton. Taking twelve months to create and requiring a budget of up to half million dollars, the work was completed in 2005. The sculpture was fabricated from 380 kilograms of aluminium, and assembled by a team of eight Croatian welders.By 2006, Oliver had held 18 solo exhibitions of her work, half of them at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, which represented her throughout her career as a sculptor. Only one of those solo exhibitions was held outside Australia: a 1992 exhibition at Auckland City Gallery. However, Oliver was represented in numerous international group shows, including five during the period 1983 to 1984, around the time...

News article: Ontario election: 5 key questions after Liberals win majority Liberal Leader Kathleen Wynne scored a surprise majority win in last night's Ontario election. Here are five key questions to consider as voters and pundits sift through the results. Leader Tim Hudak is out as leader after two failed bids to steer his party to power at Queen's Park. Voters rejected Hudak's plan for deep spending cuts to spur job growth and quickly clear the deficit. But who will pick up the Tory torch in a now depleted caucus that offers no clear choice for a successor? A list of five possible candidates is listed here. The answer will likely be more about what kind of conservative alternative the PCs want to offer. Horwath's decision to withold support for the Liberal budget triggered this 93-million snap election. In the next few weeks, she'll be left to answer why this was done when the result was a Liberal majority and an NDP seat count that stays static at 21. Horwath wakes up Friday as the leader of a party leader whose views the Liberals no longer have to listen to. Horwath was seen as the strongest of the three party leaders after the 2011 election. This time, she was somewhat hand-tied by her decision to reject a Liberal budget that many progressives liked. It will be interesting to see whether her party chooses to punish Horwath for her failed gambit and push for a new leader, or continue to support a leader who is — despite Thursday's results — a seasoned campaigner. NDP MPP Jagmeet Singh, who was re-elected in Bramalea-Gore-Malton, told CBC's Metro Morning on Friday the caucus stands by her decision to trigger the election. We'll see. After less than a year as an MPP, Doug Holyday, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's former deputy mayor, was ousted in the west Toronto riding of Etobicoke-Lakeshore. Toronto conservatives were high-fiving each other when Holyday took the riding from the Liberals in a 2013 byelection. That win gave the PCs their first foothold in the GTA, with thoughts of a full onslaught in Toronto ridings to come. Now Etobicoke-Lakeshore is Liberal red again under Holyday's former council colleague, Peter Milczyn, and the Tories were shut out of vote-rich downtown Toronto. Holyday supported Ford's fiscal agenda, then decried the mayor's antics as the crack scandal took hold last year. Ford is expected to emerge from rehab later this month and resume his bid for re-election in October. The PCs' poor showing across the GTA may not bode well for Toronto's controversial mayor or federal Conservatives seeking re-election in Toronto. All over the place is the only way to describe what pollsters were saying ahead of this election. Almost no one was predicting a majority by any party, much less the Liberals. The polls also failed to predict results in recent B.C. and Alberta elections. It may be time for professional pollsters to re-evaluate how they gauge voter intentions. Wynne did not have a strong performance in the televised debate of the main party leaders that most pundits felt Hudak won. She spent too much time on the defensive for the gas plant decision made by predecessor Dalton McGuinty. She rarely looked her opponents in the eye and many were distracted by her sharp, frequent hand gestures. In the end, though, the performances were not decisive, leaving some to wonder if debates are given too much weight. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

Premise: \\"Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic preservation.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Good fortune has caused a lack of focus preserving history.\\"?","completion":"To determine whether the premise \\"Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic preservation\\" entails the hypothesis \\"Good fortune has caused a lack of focus on preserving history,\\" I will analyze the two statements step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states that prosperity, or economic and financial success, has led to a new emphasis on preserving history. This means that when people or societies have more resources, they focus more on protecting and maintaining historical sites, artifacts, and traditions. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states that good fortune, or success and happiness, has caused a lack of focus on preserving history. This is contradictory to the premise, as it asserts that success has led to less attention being paid to historical preservation. Step 3: Check whether the premise entails the hypothesis For a premise to entail a hypothesis, it must imply that the hypothesis will also be true if the premise is true. However, the premise and the hypothesis hold contradicting positions regarding the effect of prosperity on historical preservation. The premise states that prosperity leads to more emphasis on historic preservation while the hypothesis claims that good fortune results in a lack of focus on preserving history. Based on this contradiction, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Conclusion: If the premise \\"Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic preservation\\" is true, it tells us that it does not entail the hypothesis \\"Good fortune has caused a lack of focus on preserving history\\" due to their contradicting positions on the relationship between prosperity or good fortune and the emphasis on historical preservation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The RQ-4A Global Hawk drone crashed during a routine training flight from Naval Air Station Patuxent River, according to Jamie Cosgrove, a spokeswoman for the Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons Program at the base. There were no injuries to civilians and no property damage, said the Navy, which said it is investigating the cause. Video from CNN affiliate WBOC showed smoke rising from brush fires in the unpopulated area. The drone crashed into a tributary of the Nanticoke River, a U.S. Coast Guard official said. The crash site has been blocked to recreational boat traffic while the agency investigates, the Coast Guard official said. As soon as Navy personnel lost contact with the unmanned vehicle, a piloted aircraft was dispatched to Maryland's Eastern Shore, where it came upon the wreckage and determined that it was unlikely anyone on the ground had been hurt, Navy officials told CNN. The crash occurred at about 12:11 p.m., near Bloodworth Island in Dorchester County, the Navy said. The aircraft is one of five aircraft acquired from the Air Force Global Hawk program. The BAMS-D program has been developing tactics and doctrine for the employment of high-altitude unmanned patrol aircraft since November 2006. The drone can fly for 30 hours without refueling at altitudes as high as 11 miles. It is typically used for reconnaissance. Of the five drones based at southern Maryland's Naval Air Station Patuxent River, four are in routine training and one is deployed with the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet, the officials said. The basic RQ-4A Global Hawk UAV, manufactured for the U.S. Air Force by Northrop-Grumman, is the largest and most advanced drone in the U.S. military, according to the Navy. It is 44 feet long, has a 116-foot wingspan and weighs 25,600 lbs. The vehicles cost 176 million apiece, the Government Accountability Office reported in 2010.

On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the shipyard. Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibuła news-sheet, Solidarność, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk.

I will do this by iterating through a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of n, which is approximately (sqrt(24631) ≈ 157). This is because if a number has a factor larger than its square root, it must also have a smaller factor.

You are presented with the question \\"What content increases melting points of solids?\\" and the following answer choices: - salt - Joules - water - fats - heat - glass - sugar - coal Now knowing that adding salt to a solid decreases the freezing point of that solid and water density decreases with temperature and increases with salt content, choose the best answer. A:","completion":"The question at hand is \\"What content increases melting points of solids?\\" From the given answer choices, we have - salt, Joules, water, fats, heat, glass, sugar, and coal. To find the best answer, let's discuss each option individually and understand its implications on the melting points of solids. 1. Salt: When salt is added to a solid (particularly to ice), it disrupts the stable crystal lattice structure and decreases the freezing point of the solid, not increasing the melting point as the question asks. So, salt is not the correct answer. 2. Joules: Joules are a unit of energy, not a content-type that can be added to a solid to affect its melting point. Therefore, Joules cannot be the correct answer. 3. Water: Adding water to a solid generally doesn't increase the melting point of the solid. When the solid is ice, adding water would dilute the ice fraction and can lower the freezing point under specific conditions. So, water is not the correct answer. 4. Fats: Fats generally have lower melting points as compared to other molecules like salts and sugars. They don't affect the melting point of other solids in a way that would lead to increased melting points. Thus, fats are not the correct answer. 5. Heat: Although heat is critical in the process of melting a solid, it itself is not a content that can be added to solids to increase their melting points. Heat only facilitates the transition from solid to liquid by providing the required energy. 6. Glass: Glass is an amorphous solid, and it does not chemically interact with other solids in a way that might cause an increase in their melting points. Therefore, glass is not the correct answer. 7. Sugar: Adding sugar to a solid can increase the melting point of the mixture. When sugar is mixed with a solid, it forms hydrogen bonds with the molecules of the solid, making the lattice structure more stable and thus requiring more energy (higher temperature) to break those bonds and melt the mixture. Consequently, sugar is the best answer among the options. 8. Coal: Coal is a carbonaceous material that does not interact with other solids to increase their melting points. If anything, heating coal to high temperatures would turn it into gas, and it would not increase the melting point of other solids. In conclusion, out of the given answer choices, sugar is the best answer for the content that increases the melting points of solids. This is primarily because sugar forms hydrogen bonds with the molecules of the solid, resulting in a more stable lattice structure, and requiring more energy (higher temperature) to break those bonds and cause melting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the last minute, Lilya is left behind in the care of her aunt Anna (Liliya Shinkaryova). She is forced to move into a dirty flat (whilst her aunt moved into the bigger and nicer flat that Lilya and her mother used to live in) is just the beginning and a succession of miseries are thrust upon Lilya. Lilya's best friend encourages her to join her in prostituting herself for some extra cash but Lilya decides not to. However, when the friend's father finds money made from prostitution, the friend claims that she was the one sat at the bar whilst Lilya was out sleeping with men for the money. Not only is Lilya's reputation at home ruined but the story begins to spread throughout the school. Now abandoned, Lilya has to turn to prostitution to help her get money together.

Before Jason could move in as a tenant to Dennis's apartment complex,","completion":"Before Jason could move in as a tenant to Dennis's apartment complex, there were several important steps and requirements he needed to accomplish and adhere to in order to ensure a smooth transition into his new living space. First and foremost, Jason needed to fill out a rental application form, which would provide Dennis with all the necessary information about him, his rental history, employment, and income. This is a crucial step for any landlord-tenant relationship, as it allows both parties to gauge each other's ability to maintain a mutually beneficial agreement. After submitting his application, Jason would then need to go through a thorough background and credit check, allowing Dennis the apartment complex owner to ensure that he is a responsible and reliable tenant. This process guarantees that Jason has a clean record and steady income, ensuring that he is capable of maintaining the monthly rent payments and contributing to a safe and harmonious environment with other tenants within the complex. Once the screening process was completed and found satisfactory, Jason would need to read and sign a lease agreement. The lease agreement is a legally binding document that outlines the terms and conditions of the rental, such as the duration of the lease, rent amount, payment due dates, security deposit details, and the rights and responsibilities of both the landlord and tenant. By signing the lease, Jason would be committing to comply with all the terms and conditions stated therein. In addition to the lease agreement, Jason might also need to review and agree to a set of house rules established by Dennis for the entire apartment complex. These rules may include things like quiet hours, garbage disposal protocol, pet policies, and common area maintenance, among others. Adhering to these rules ensures a peaceful and harmonious living environment not only for Jason but also for other tenants within the apartment complex. Once all the necessary paperwork has been completed and submitted, Jason would be required to provide a security deposit. This deposit is intended to cover any potential damages to the rented unit, and it is usually equivalent to one month's rent. This deposit would be held by Dennis and could be returned to Jason at the end of his lease, provided there are no damages or outstanding payments. After securing the unit with a deposit and completing all required documentation, Dennis would then need to prepare the unit for Jason's move-in. This may involve conducting a walk-through inspection of the unit with Jason, noting any existing signs of wear and tear or damages. Both parties would sign off on this inspection report, agreeing to the current condition of the unit. This document becomes significant when determining whether any damages incurred during Jason's tenancy would be deducted from his security deposit at the end of his lease. Finally, once all these steps have been carried out, and both Jason and Dennis are satisfied with the arrangements, Jason would be given the keys to his new home at the apartment complex. He would then proceed to move in and start a new chapter of his life as a tenant at Dennis's apartment complex. Both parties would be expected to maintain open lines of communication and uphold their respective responsibilities, ensuring a lasting and successful landlord-tenant relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During the Paleocene, the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents. Europe and Greenland were still connected. North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate. The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the Neogene); the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north toward Europe, slowly closing the Tethys Ocean, and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"To answer the question \\"Which happened more recently the Paleocene or the Cretaceous Period?\\", I will compare the time periods of both events. Step 1: Identify the time periods of the Paleocene and Cretaceous Periods. - The Paleocene is an epoch that occurred between 66 million years ago and 56 million years ago. - The Cretaceous Period is a geological period that occurred between 145 million years ago and 66 million years ago. Step 2: Compare the time periods of the Paleocene and Cretaceous Periods. Comparing the end dates: - The Paleocene ended 56 million years ago. - The Cretaceous Period ended 66 million years ago. Step 3: Determine which event happened more recently. Since the Paleocene ended 56 million years ago, which is more recent than the Cretaceous Period's end at 66 million years ago, the Paleocene happened more recently.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? Question: Who is the hairdresser?

It would have to be this… Donald Trump once cashed a 0.13 check… In 1990, writer from a “Spy Magazine” had a great idea for a prank: “What would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price? In their words: \\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\\" Spy thought \\"some subterfuge\\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for 0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump. Seriously.” I really don’t know if this is the most “cheapskate” thing, on just CRAZY fiscal responsibility.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? The first time I went here was for a pedicure and it was excellent! The tubs were clean and sanitized, as were the tools used for the pedicure. They use a type of chemical for your heels to slough off dead skin instead of a razor (this remover cost 3, but is well worth it). Then they do a nice calf and foot massage at the end. I also noticed that they did gel nails, so I decided I would come back for those the next week. And so I did...I walked in and asked for pink and white gels. They were oh so happy to oblige. I sat down and the girl immediately got to work. She started the sanding down of the nail and applied the white tips...and this is when it started to go down hill. The girl was distracted and said she had to do something in the back, but would be back in a moment. So I said okay...no biggie. I can wait a minute. The guy sitting next to her said he would finish for her (which is a good thing, because she didn't come back for about 20 minutes). So I moved over and he started his work. Everything was going as normal...until he started to apply the \\"gel.\\" The \\"gel\\" came in powder form. Hmmm...gel...in powder form? How does that even make sense? OH, yeah...that would be because it isn't gel. It's acrylic and they use a gel topcoat/nail polish on top. Yet, they charge you more. It's a total scam. Regardless, I was leaving town the next day and just let them do their thing. After I paid and left I really started looking at my nails...and they were CROOKED! Not only was the filing off (completely lopsided on a few nails - luckily that can be remedied with a nail file), but so were a couple of the tips! When she put them on, she didn't even check to make sure they were straight! To make matters worse, these nails yellowed! That can happen when a cheap acrylic is used and is exposed to any type of UV light, aka tanning beds...or if you spend an excessive amount of time outside. I thought maybe it was just the surface that yellowed, but when I got them taken off today (in favor of REAL gel nails at another salon) I noticed they were yellowed all the way through! IF it's yellow all the way through, it's most likely that you have cheap or even toxic MMA Acrylic on your nails!!

The pedicure was good but the nail service was not as expected. The problem was that they were told they were getting gel nails, but it was actually acrylic. They were charged more for this. Also, the application was messy - the nails were crooked and eventually turned yellow. This reviewer won't go back there for nails again. For a simple way to understand, imagine if you get an ice cream, but instead you've been given a vegetable you don't like and you also have to pay more for it, you wouldn't be happy, right?

Article: Invented in Turkey and patented by Nanopool, a German company, the spray-on liquid glass might become one of the most useful inventions in the field of nanotechnology. The product was tested at the Saarbrucken Institute for New Materials. It is worth mentioning that the invention is transparent and non-poisonous. The liquid glass can protect any type of surface from damages caused by water, UV radiation, dirt, heat, and bacterial infections. Besides, it is flexible and breathable, which means that the liquid glass can be applied on plants and seeds as well. Researchers found that the spray greatly increases the resistance of plants to bacteria-caused diseases. The trials also showed that the sprayed seeds grew faster. Depending on the type of surface that is to be covered, researchers can add water or ethanol to the spray. Scientists say that _ . The spray produces a coating that is just 100nm thick. Trials by food processing plants in Germany have concluded that foods covered with the glass can store longer than those stored in normal condition. According to Neil McClelland, UK project manager with Nanopool, due to its capabilities, the spray-on liquid glass can become one of the most useful inventions around the world, ending up being used by a lot of industries that will cover their products. At present, the invention is being used by a train company and a hotel chain in the UK, as well as a hamburger chain in Germany that are carrying out tests of the liquid glass for various uses. The spray-on liquid glass was also tested in a Lancashire hospital, where it showed \\"very promising\\" results, being used to cover medical equipment and bandages. The invention could be also used on clothing, because it cannot be seen by the naked eye, thus clothes could become stain resistant. Due to its unique characteristics, the liquid glass can be used to cover bathrooms, sinks and many other surfaces in the home. According to the researchers, the spay-on glass can last for a year. It is expected to hit the DIY stores... Question: Which of the following about the liquid glass is NOTtrue? Options: A: We can still see an object clearly covered with the liquid.

Article:But they are not movie stars or supermodels: they are Hong Kong's A-list \\"tutor kings\\" and \\"tutor queens\\", offering pupils a chance to improve mediocre grades. In Hong Kong's consumer culture, looks sell. Celebrity tutors in their sophisticated hair-dos and designer trappings are treated like idols by their young fans who flock to their classes. And they have earnings to match - some have become millionaires and appear regularly on television shows. \\"If you want to be a top tutor, it definitely helps if you are young and attractive. Students look at your appearance,\\" said Kelly Mok, 26, a \\"tutor queen\\" at King's Glory, one of Hong Kong's largest tutorial establishments. Her designer clothes and accessories are not just for the billboards; it's how she likes to dress outside classes. But she is also careful to add that she wouldn't be in such high demand if she could not deliver top grades in her subject, English. Richard Eng from Beacon College is often credited with being the first of Hong Kong's \\"star tutors\\". A former secondary school teacher, he says he got the idea after he featured in photographs advertising his sister, a performance artist. \\"In school all the teachers look the same, there's no excitement,\\" he said. His own image appears on special ring-binders and folders containing study tips, or pens which harbour a pull-out scroll with his picture and other gifts. Such items became so sought after that they propelled him to near-rock star status among young people. The celebrity tutor phenomenon is a result of the huge growth in out-of-school tutoring in Asia. It is fuelled by highly pressured examination systems and ambitious parents wanting their children to secure places at top universities and high-status secondary schools. In societies where success is equated with good exam results, parental anxiety converts into a \\"steady stream of revenue\\" for tutoring establishments, according to a study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The tutoring industry, or \\"shadow education\\" as the ADB calls it, has become very widespread in Asia, fed by the growth in universities and the rising proportion of school leavers aiming for university. Hong Kong University's professor Mark Bray, one of the authors of the ADB study, said a staggering 72% of final-year school students in Hong Kong now go to private tutors. Richer families have always paid for individual tutoring, but the star tutors offer exam tips and revision notes to the less well-off, studying in groups of over 100. It's not just Hong Kong. Tutoring has \\"spread and intensified in Asia and become more commercialised,\\" said professor Bray. In South Korea, 90% of primary school children attend such classes. In South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India, tutorial schools use star tutors to attract even more students. \\"They have found a way to appeal to young people and pull them in. They create a buzz,\\" he said. \\"We had this phenomenon of star tutors in Kota as well,\\" said Pramod Maheshwari, chief executive of Career Point Coaching School in Kota, Rajasthan, India, a city of residential tutorial colleges which attract students from all over the country. \\"It can give you an edge.\\" But ultimately, he says, expansion of tutoring is driven not by personalities but by \\"the inefficiency of the school system\\". \\"Across India, students' education level is not up to the mark, and millions are preparing for competitive college examinations. It is a huge market,\\" said Mr Maheshwari. In China, where private tutorial schools were unknown until the economy opened up in the 1990s, New Oriental Education and Technology has grown to become one of the largest tutoring schools in Asia with around 2.4 million students this year. It boasts 17,600 teachers in 49 cities and an online network of over 7.8 million users. Listed on the New York stock exchange since 2006, its founder Michael Yu (also known as Yu Minhong), became a multi-millionaire on the back of his blend of rote learning exercises, stand-up comedy and motivational speeches. A man from a humble background, who had become an English teacher at Peking University, Mr Yu used the Hong Kong model of employing star tutors to prepare students for tests for universities abroad. Extensive tutoring is sometimes seen as contributing to East Asian countries' high performance in international school comparisons, particularly in mathematics. But professor Bray points out that the high performers in the international Pisa tests (Programme for International Student Assessment) also include countries that do not use much tutoring, such as in Scandinavia. There have also been attempts to reduce the impact of tuition. In the 1980s, the South Korean government issued a blanket prohibition on such private tutoring. It proved to be unenforceable, but it reflected worries that tuition can put too much pressure on pupils, with teachers complaining that pupils were falling asleep in class after long nights of tutoring. In 2009, the South Korean government adopted measures to limit the number of hours students spent in \\"hagwons\\" or tutorial centres in a bid to reduce childhood stress and increase the level of creative thinking. But the impact has been limited, pushing many tutorial classes online. The government has since realised that the only way to change is to alter the exam culture, reducing the number of university entrance exams and encouraging universities to consider applicants on more than just exam scores. A Singaporean study showed that while tutoring can have a positive influence on the subject being tutored, time taken away from other subjects may lead to a decline in overall academic performance. The ADB report says in all parts of Asia, families are spending a considerable amount of the household income on tutoring. It may contribute to improved achievement for individual students, but it can exacerbate social inequalities. Although there is some evidence of a cultural propensity to pay for tutoring - cities such as Vancouver in Canada and Sydney in Australia with large Chinese communities have a lot of tutoring - this is not the only factor. \\"What happens in tutoring depends on what the schools and universities ask for. The parents will respond to whatever they think will get them in,\\" said professor Bray. Hong Kong recently shifted from a system similar to GCSEs and A-levels used in the UK to a single examination taken at age 17, leading to an explosion in tutoring. \\"There is greater pressure on students because there is only one examination that determines whether you get into university,\\" said Kelly Mok. \\"With so many tutors in Hong Kong, students don't know who to choose so they go for the 'tutor kings' and 'tutor queens',\\" she said. Some students just attend the lectures and watch video recordings of lectures while others purchase add-ons such as personalised interaction with the star tutor or tutor's aide via Facebook or email. But as more students enrol, it can become increasingly difficult to keep up with examination tips learned by classmates. \\"Students who would not otherwise have had tutoring may now do so in order not to be at a competitive disadvantage,\\" says professor Bray. But Richard Eng denies that tutors are sowing panic. \\"Panic comes from the exams themselves. If there was no examination in Hong Kong, no matter what I say or look like, they would not come to me.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"In Hong Kong, \\"tutor kings\\" and \\"tutor queens\\" have emerged as young, attractive private tutors with celebrity-like status who teach subjects such as English and math to help students improve their grades. These celebrity tutors have massive followings and often earn millions of dollars due to their popularity and high demand. The celebrity tutor phenomenon has been fueled by Asia's highly competitive examination systems and increasingly ambitious parents who have hopes for their children to secure spots at top universities and prestigious secondary schools. In Hong Kong, for instance, it has been reported that about 72% of final-year school students attend private tutoring sessions to improve their grades. While wealthier families can afford individual tutoring for their children, others turn to these well-known tutors for exam tips and large group classes. These tutors have been successful in creating a buzz and attracting young students by offering a more dynamic and engaging experience than schools, which have been criticized for being inefficient and less exciting. The tutoring industry, or \\"shadow education\\" as it is referred to by the Asian Development Bank, has grown rapidly across Asia due to the increase in access to higher education and job opportunities requiring university degrees. Tutoring schools in countries such as South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India have also started using celebrity tutors to attract more students. While some may attribute East Asian countries' high performance in international school comparisons to the impact of extensive tutoring, there are also concerns that this aggressive tutoring culture can exacerbate social inequalities and negatively affect overall academic performance. South Korea has even attempted to limit the number of hours students spend in tutorial centers in an effort to reduce childhood stress and foster more creative thinking. Still, it seems that the celebrity tutor phenomenon will continue to have a strong presence in Asia as long as students and parents perceive them as the key to academic success."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After completing his training he is tasked by Sargon to kill Noah, Mathayus's own brother. He saves him and escapes the city, but a magic arrow follows them and kills Noah. Mathayus boards a ship to Egypt, accompanied by his childhood friend Layla. He intends to get the Spear of Osiris in Egypt, which he believes will be able to pass through Sargon's black magic protection. A fellow traveller, Greek poet Aristophanes (Ari), tells Mathayus and Layla that the Spear only kills Egyptian creatures, but the Sword of Damocles will work. The trio travels to Greece, where they can enter the Underworld to retrieve the Sword of Damocles. On the way, they fall into a cell and are surrounded by men left as sacrifices for the Minotaur. Some of the sacrifices are mercenaries who owe allegiance to Mathayus' father, so they help him and Layla to defeat the Minotaur, with help from a Chinese captive named Fung.

The Amazon River rises in the Andes Mountains at the west of the basin with its main tributary the Marañón River in Peru. It is usually considered to be the second longest river in the world. However, a team of Brazilian scientists has claimed that the Amazon is the longest river in the world. It covers about 6,400 km before draining into the Atlantic Ocean. The Amazon and its tributaries form the largest volume of water. The Amazon accounts for about 20% of the total water carried to the oceans by rivers.

While resting and sleeping, an individual's oxygen demand decreases as the body's metabolic activities slow down. Therefore, the lungs do not need to work as hard to absorb oxygen from the air. As a result, the respiratory rate (breathing rate) slows down, and there's a reduction in overall oxygen consumption. This effect can be considered an indirect effect on the process of oxygen absorption. Although the ability of the lungs to absorb oxygen is not directly affected by resting or sleeping, the body's oxygen requirement decreases, leading to a reduced demand for oxygen absorption by the lungs."},{"prompt":"Q:I have a new situation: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot. But I can use this background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] What is an answer for this question: Which lake had fewer dissolved nutrients?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Stephen Larkham (born 29 May 1974 in Canberra) is a retired Australian rugby union footballer currently in the role of attack coach for the Australian Rugby Union side, the Wallabies. He is best known for his career with the Brumbies in Super Rugby, for whom he played from the inception of the professional Super 12 in 1996 through 2007, and his long tenure with the Wallabies at international level, for whom he played 102 times. After initial selection at fullback from 1996 to 1997, Larkham was the first-choice Australian fly-half from 1997 to 2007, playing in the 1999, 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups. He is married to Jacqueline and has two children, Jaimee and Tiahna. Larkham was an important part of the Australian 2003 World Cup squad which lost in the tournament final to England. He has suffered greatly from injuries through his career, especially to his knees and right elbow. Despite these he remained a competent defender in spite of his relatively light frame. He was also tried at inside centre by John Connolly for one test against Wales 2006 but the experiment was not regarded a success and he never played there again. He was famous for forming a long-standing half-back partnership with George Gregan, both of whom were foundation players with the ACT Brumbies rugby franchise. When both retired after the 2007 World Cup, not only were they the two most-capped Wallabies, but they played in more Tests than any other scrum-half/fly-half combination in history, with 79 appearances together. So important were they to the team that in 2007 at Bruce Stadium (Canberra Stadium), a new stand was unveiled as the \\"Gregan-Larkham Stand\\" in honour of both players and their combination to the team. He played his last test against Japan in the 2007 World Cup before a knee injury sidelined him, which effectively ended his Test career as Australia were then knocked out of the competition before he could return. On 14 May 2007, despite larger offers from French and English teams, Larkham signed a contract with Edinburgh Rugby in Scotland to join them after the 2007 World Cup; however; this deal subsequently fell through, reportedly because the Scottish Rugby Union would not fund the deal. Newly promoted Leeds expressed an interest, as did the Welsh side, the Dragons. However, in January 2008 it was announced that he will join Ricoh Black Rams of Japan. Larkham played for the ACT Veterans Rugby Club at the World Vintage Rugby Carnival in Hawaii in September 2012. During this carnival he also played as a reserve for an old boys team from Brazil who, not realising who he was, asked him to play second row because he was tall. Despite his other commitments, Larkham occasionally still plays with the ACT Veterans to help them raise funds for the charities they support. On 18 February 2018, he received the GENLEC Player of the Day jacket for his great play and sportsmanship in the Clare Holland Cup charity match. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he participate in any World Cups in his later career?","completion":"Yes, Stephen Larkham participated in World Cups in his later career.

Definition: Given a question and a context passage, generate the answer having the word or phrase from the context passage. Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Input: Context: The mechanism of L-DOPA for antinociception was investigated. Nociceptive behaviors in mice after an intrathecal (i.t.) administration of substance P were evaluated. L-DOPA (i.t.) dose-dependently attenuated the substance P-induced nociceptive behaviors. Co-administration of benserazide (i.t.), a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, abolished the antinociceptive effect of L-DOPA. The L-DOPA-induced antinociception was antagonized by sulpiride, a D2 blocker, but not by SCH 23390, a D1 blocker. These results suggest that L-DOPA relieves pain after conversion to dopamine, with the dopamine sedating pain transmission by way of the dopamine D2 receptor.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Students can learn a lot from actively participating in class. One way that you can encourage participation is by having constructive class discussions. Ask open-ended questions so that students have to give more than a yes or no answer. Don't ask questions with a set answer in mind. Discussions should help students explore different ideas. Younger kids can start to learn critical thinking by answering questions. You could try, \\"What are some ways to show kindness?\\" You'll get lots of different answers! For example, you could ask, “Why is it so important that we take steps to protect the environment?” You could also try, “Do you think the U.S. should get involved in trying to solve problems in other countries? Why or why not?” In addition to discussion, you can try lots of other ways to help students get involved in class. Anything that gets the students doing something new for a few minutes is good. You can easily adjust activities according to the subject you teach. For almost any subject, you could try short in-class writing assignments. This will give students a break from listening to you talk and give them some time to learn more actively. Say, “Okay, everyone spend 5 minutes writing about what you think the key points of today's topic. When you're done, we'll share our thoughts as a large group.” Ask students to relate the topic to their own lives. For example, “Write a paragraph about what kinds of things your family does to help the environment.” Try Stand Up Sit Down. For example, if you are trying to teach the difference between proper nouns and common nouns, you can have students stand up if the word you say is a proper noun and sit down if it is a common noun. You can apply this to many subjects, including math. Try having students stand up if a number is prime and sit down if it is not. Working together can help students see material in a new way. It can also make things more fun! In addition to assigning group projects, you can find other creative ways to help students interact with one another. Try Think-Pair-Share. Give students a question, and give them a few minutes to think about their answer. Then, have them pair up and share their answers with each other. Finally, have each pair share their answers with the whole class. This works great with high school and college students. Play a matching game. Hand out a note card with a word or phrase on it and have students get up and find their match. You can do this with rhyming words, synonyms, problems/solutions, or anything that you want! Elementary school kids can have lots of fun with this one. Getting out of the classroom is a great way to help students connect to material! Field trips are a great way to bring some excitement to the topic you're teaching. Make sure that the field trip clearly relates to what you are teaching. For example, if you've been learning about environmental issues, take students to a self-sustaining farm. If you've been teaching about the solar system, take a trip to a planetarium. Make sure to follow all school policies when you're planning a field trip. For high school and college students, constructive debates are a great way for students to connect with the material. During discussions, encourage students to share opposing viewpoints. For example, if you are talking about whether or not peaceful protests are constructive, have students clearly explain their viewpoints. Make sure that students remain civil. No name calling, raised voices, or insults! If things start to get heated, wrap up the debate. Say, \\"We obviously have lots of strong feelings on this. To wrap up, take 5 minutes to write down what you feel are the key points on this issue.\\" Summary:","completion":"This article talks about the importance of students participating in class and suggests various fun activities and discussions to help them learn better and connect with the subject matter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Indeed, for as long as it has existed and by definition, the cyberspace is a virtual space free of any government intervention. Where everyone agree that an improvement on cybersecurity is more than vital, is the government the best actor to solve this issue? Many government officials and experts think that the government should step in and that there is a crucial need for regulation, mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem. R. Clarke said during a panel discussion at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco, he believes that the \\"industry only responds when you threaten regulation. If industry doesn't respond (to the threat), you have to follow through.\\" On the other hand, executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary, but think that the government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently. Where is government intervention most common? What is the answer?

It's a special place where people can play, learn, and talk with their friends without having a grown-up, like the government, watching over them. But sometimes, people don't play nice or might even be mean in this playground. Now, some grown-ups (government officials and experts) say that the government should step in and make rules for everyone in the playground. They believe this is important because the people who own this playground (private sector) don't seem to be good at keeping everyone safe. Other people, like the playground owners (executives from the private sector), think it's better to fix things themselves without the government telling them what to do. They worry that if the government makes rules, they won't be able to come up with new, creative ways to make the playground even more fun.

Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that \\"I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy\\" and complaining of \\"the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth\\" which he considered \\"such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it\\". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his... Answer:","completion":"Etty"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue writing the following text. The man could write instructions for building engines but not houses, since","completion":"his expertise lay primarily in the domain of mechanical engineering. As a renowned mechanical engineer, he had spent a significant portion of his life studying, designing, and constructing various types of engines – from internal combustion engines found in cars, to steam engines and turbines that powered massive industrial machines and generators. His deep understanding of the mechanical principles, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics involved in the function of engines had made him an authority in the field. However, this same man found himself unable to write instructions for building houses because his knowledge and experience did not extend to civil engineering and architecture. While mechanical engineering primarily focuses on the design, development, and analysis of mechanisms and machines, civil engineering concerns the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of various infrastructures such as roads, bridges, buildings, and other physical facilities. Building a house involves understanding materials and their varying properties, like wood, steel, concrete, and bricks, as well as accounting for factors like the structural stability of the building, environmental stresses, and local building codes and regulations. Furthermore, architectural design principles such as aesthetics, functionality, and spatial optimization need to be considered in order to create a comfortable and efficient living space. Such considerations are quite distant from the man's area of expertise, which lies primarily in the mechanical realm. Though engineering, in general, focuses on problem-solving and design, there are distinct differences between the various disciplines. In mechanical engineering, the man would rely on Newton's laws of motion, equations relating to heat transfer and fluid dynamics, and principles of materials science to optimize the performance of engines. In contrast, with civil engineering and architecture, the knowledge required extends to concepts such as soil mechanics, structural analysis, and urban planning – all of which are critical factors in designing and constructing houses. The man could certainly attempt to learn civil engineering and architectural principles, but this would likely take a significant amount of time, involving additional education, research, and hands-on experience. Moreover, writing instructions for building houses would require not only an understanding of these principles but also a familiarity with the specific types of materials and techniques utilized in a given region, to account for differences in climate, culture, and aesthetics. In conclusion, the man could write comprehensive instructions for building engines, drawing from his considerable knowledge and experience in mechanical engineering. But when it comes to constructing houses, his lack of knowledge and experience in the fields of civil engineering and architecture hinder his ability to generate detailed guidance on the subject. Such a task would require an expanded understanding of the relevant principles and context, proper interdisciplinary collaboration, or even a significant investment of time and effort in acquiring new knowledge and skills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The white sands, imported from the far west mountains of limestone, sucked up the fire of the huge red sun. It was always hot in the south desert. Even in the deep of night the stones of Gazu Kadem kept the city warm. Now, at mid-day, it was at its hottest. A quarter of a million people at the arena didn't make it any cooler. The merchants, nobles, and the slaves lucky enough to attend had waited outside Dan Trex's arena for days. They knew the value of entertainment in such a dark world. They wore cowls to protect themselves from the sun as they waited. Entire businesses thrived on the forced mercantile of the captive audience. Food went for thrice its cost to those waiting near the entrance. Water went for five times as much. The arena was as old as the city, built in the days of the old empire for a king now long forgotten. The octagonal arena was a machine, an engine that built warriors out of the raw material of flesh, blood, and steel. Now, thousands of years later, it still served that purpose. The machine had built Dan Trex's army, half a million of the most ruthless and well trained soldiers to ever walk the planet. While one hundred and fifty thousand civilians and slaves got drunk, gambled, shat, fucked, and slept on the stone steps; one hundred thousand of his men sat in silence wearing black and bronze and watching him as Trex walked out into the arena alone and unhelmed.
