Information: - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - The Temple of Elemental Evil is a 2003 role - playing video game by Troika Games . It is a remake of the classic Dungeons & Dragons adventure of the same title using the 3.5 edition rules . This is the only video game to take place in the Greyhawk campaign setting , and the first video game to implement the 3.5 edition rule set . The game was published by Atari , who then held the interactive rights of the Dungeons & Dragons franchise . The Temple of Elemental Evil was released in autumn of 2003 and was criticized for stability issues and other bugs . The turn - based tactical combat , however , was generally thought to be implemented well , and is arguably the most faithful representation of the then - current tabletop role - playing game ( \`\` 3.5e '' ) rules in a video game . - Troika Games was a video game developer co-founded by Jason Anderson, Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky. The company was focused on role-playing video games between 1998 and 2005, best known for \\"\\" and \\"\\". - Atari Interactive is a name used by several separate groups and corporations since the mid-1990s. In 1996, it was the name of Atari Corporation's PC publishing division, bringing games like the Atari Jaguar's \\"Tempest 2000\\" to the PC platform. From 1998 to 2001, Atari Interactive, Inc. was the name of the corporate entity that held the Atari properties purchased from JTS by Hasbro in 1998, and functioned as the retro publishing subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive. It is currently the name of a wholly owned subsidiary of Atari, SA (formerly Infogrames), who is the current owner of the Atari brand and various other properties formerly belonging to Hasbro Interactive. It was formed in 2001, when IESA acquired Hasbro Interactive and proceeded to rename it to Infogrames Interactive. In 2003, IESA then changed the company name entirely to Atari Interactive, Inc. as part of its worldwide reorganization to focus on use of the Atari brand. - Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as \\"Computer Space\\" came before it, \\"Pong\\" was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created \\"Pong\\" as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game. - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost. - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview. - Tim Cain is an American video game developer best known as the producer, lead programmer and one of the main designers of the 1997 computer game \\"Fallout\\". In 2009 he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - Leonard Boyarsky is an American computer game designer and visual artist best known for being one of the key designers of the video games \\"Fallout\\" and \\"Diablo III\\". - Atari, Inc. was an American video game developer and home computer company founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Primarily responsible for the formation of the video arcade and modern video game industries, the company was closed and its assets split in 1984 as a direct result of the North American video game crash of 1983. - Atari, SA (ASA) is an international French holding company headquartered in Paris, France. It was originally called Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). Its subsidiaries include Atari London Studio, Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc.. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well. All three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy, and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign. - Nolan Kay Bushnell (born February 5, 1943) is an American electrical engineer and businessman. He established Atari, Inc. and the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza-Time Theaters chain. Bushnell has been inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame and the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame, received the BAFTA Fellowship and the Nations Restaurant News Innovator of the Year award, and was named one of \\"Newsweek\\"s \\"50 Men Who Changed America.\\" Bushnell has started more than twenty companies and is one of the founding fathers of the video game industry. He is currently on the board of Anti-Aging Games, but his latest venture is an educational software company called Brainrush that is using video game technology in educational software, incorporating real brain science, in a way that Bushnell believes will fundamentally change education. Nolan, who is co-founder and chairman of Brainrush, believes that Brainrush will be his biggest success. - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit.

I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, but it's still pretty damn long, so apologies in advance. I'm a sophomore in college and my birthday was late in January. Towards the beginning of the month during break I had asked my mom if they would be able to come down to campus around my birthday and do something with me and my friends. I wasn't sure if financially they could, as a couple things had happened that made money more of a concern than usual. She told me not to worry about that and to figure out what I wanted to do. Over the next few weeks I had a lot to do - with classes starting, research, my grading job, and trying to find time for my friends and a little for myself I was pretty busy. Because of this I kept forgetting to figure out what I wanted to do when they came. My mom continued asking every few days or so, but I kept forgetting (this is a common problem with me and it's really frustrating, it leads to issues for me sometimes). I should also note that I'll miss calls or texts from them a decent amount because I'm not around my phone often, but at home I'm more attentive to it because I have much more free time. This frustrates my parents, especially my mom, as they think I don't pay attention to them. Anyway, it got a to few days before the weekend before my birthday, and my parents told me they couldn't make it that morning and would come next weekend. I decided that week that I wanted to either go bowling or play mini golf, depending on what worked best for everyone. I told my mom, and she said I needed to figure out which for sure, what time, who was coming, if anyone needed a ride, etc. I'd say this was about Monday, maybe? I was busy throughout the week and didn't have much time to talk to people, alongside the fact that I would constantly forget only to remember later and feel anxious about it. This all finally came to a head last night, where my mom snapped. Something important is that she has some anger issues. She would never hurt me or anything, but she gets extremely angry and screams. Well, that's what happened. I was with my girlfriend in bed late at night and had forgotten my phone in a different room. I remembered it and went to grab it. Then I saw my mom had texted me several times and tried to call me 10 times in the span of two minutes. I should also note that using Tasker I had it set up on my phone so that if I shook my phone, it would mute all sound and automatically reject calls. I had left it on before I left my phone, so no sound was being played and all calls were being rejected. So I shit myself out of terror and called her immediately. She then yelled at me for 7 minutes about how I didn't care about her or my dad and that I was being disrespectful for not getting back to her sooner. There was more she said, but I've forgotten most due to a bit of overload and just generally being forgetful. She concluded by asking why if I don't care, she should care and said something else after that. I couldn't hear the last part because I was exhausted, so I asked what she said and apologized saying that I was tired and missed it. Then she said \\"You know what? I'm done. BYE!\\" and hung up on me. My girlfriend and I talked about it, and I turned my volume on anticipating that I would get a call back. About 20 minutes later I did. I can't remember much of that call, just that it was upsetting. At one point I know she said if I disrespected her like that again she would keep my truck (which is being repaired - they're paying for the repairs if that matters), break my phone, bring me home every weekend, and at some other point she said she'd break my fingers (dont remember how that came up? It was still while saying basically that I had better never do that again. I should also clarify that my mom has never hurt me and I know she wont, even if she threatens to sometimes when she gets really angry). Those were the most intense things, but the rest of the call was also pretty bad. Sorry I can't give more of it. Earlier today my Dad called to figure out what I had wanted to do. I told him what I had planned and we put together the last parts (ended up being bowling if anyone cares). He was also angry about how I had waited until the last minute and yelled at me a bit too, though it wasn't nearly as bad as with my mom. He basically was telling me how frustrating it was to not be able to contact me when they need me, and that it seems like I don't care about them. He did say they wanted to do this for me and see me but it seemed like I didn't care at all. In addition he said I was stressing my mom out because they didn't know what was going on yet, that my mom was already feeling sick and that was making it worse, and that they spent an hour last night talking about me and this whole thing when they could've been sleeping. My mom was there too and said something along the lines of how I only want their money and don't give a damn about them. After a bit of that we hung up, and that's where I am now. So, I'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, I really should've figured things out earlier. I meant to, I just was busy and kept forgetting, though my parents say that's not an excuse. I can be pretty bad about getting back to them sometimes. Usually I'll respond within a day, but once in a while I'll miss it for longer. I can see how that would be frustrating. But on the other hand, I feel like they, especially my mom, went way overboard and that it wasnt nearly bad enough to justify that kind of response. This sort of thing happens somewhat often and I usually feel conflicted about it. I've wanted to post before, but never did until now. So, AITA?

She achieved critical acclaim with her own recordings, particularly the albums Eli and the Thirteenth Confession (1968) and New York Tendaberry (1969), and had commercial success with artists such as Barbra Streisand and The 5th Dimension recording her songs. By 1976, her marriage had ended, and she released an album of new material, Smile. She then embarked on a four-month tour with a full band, which resulted in the 1977 live album Season of Lights. After the 1978 album Nested, recorded when she was pregnant with her only child, she again took a break from recording, this time until 1984's Mother's Spiritual. She began touring with a band in 1988, her first concert appearances in 10 years. The tour was dedicated to the animal rights movement. The shows led to her 1989 release, Laura: Live at the Bottom Line, which included six new compositions. Her final album of predominantly original material, Walk the Dog and Light the Light (1993), her last album for Columbia, was co-produced by Gary Katz, best known for his work with Steely Dan. The release sparked reappraisal of her place in popular music, and new commercial offers began appearing. She turned down lucrative film-composing offers, although she contributed a rare protest song to the Academy Award-winning documentary Broken Rainbow, about the unjust relocation of the Navajo people. Nyro performed increasingly in the 1980s and 1990s with female musicians, including her friend Nydia \\"Liberty\\" Mata, a drummer, and several others from the lesbian-feminist women's music subculture, such as members of the band Isis. During this period, Nyro made appearances at such venues as the 1989 Michigan Womyn's Music Festival and the 1989 Newport Folk Festival, of which a CD containing portions of her performance was released. On July 4, 1991, she opened for Bob Dylan at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts. Among her last performances were at Union Chapel, Islington, London, England in November 1994; The New York Bottom Line Christmas Eve Show in 1994; and at McCabe's in Los Angeles February 11 and 12, 1995. Both The Tonight Show and the Late Show with David Letterman staffs heavily pursued Nyro for a TV appearance during this period, yet she turned them down as well, citing her discomfort with appearing on television (she made only a handful of early TV appearances and one fleeting moment on VH-1 performing the title song from Broken Rainbow on Earth Day in 1990). According to producer Gary Katz, she also turned down a request to be the musical guest on the fall 1993 season opener of Saturday Night Live. She never released an official video, although there was talk of filming some The Bottom Line appearances in the 1990s.

(CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings. Question: \\"What rules exist throughout the country because of a California ban?\\" Answer: \\"Anti tanning laws\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, the answer is not entirely accurate. The correct answer would be: \\"Smoking bans in workplaces, bars, and restaurants, as well as other health and safety laws.\\" While the text does mention a ban on teens using tanning booths in California, it does not state that this particular rule has spread throughout the country."},{"prompt":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Persian.

The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies. Paragraph: Two neighboring gulfs had different geographical features. South gulf has shallow water and is wider, while North gulf is quite deep. Both gulfs are exposed to intense wave activity throughout the year. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The North gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom. Step 1: Identify the factors that affect erosion From the background information, we know that waves traveling into shallow water lead to more significant erosion of the ocean bottom. Step 2: Compare the gulfs' geographical features The South gulf has shallow water and is wider, while the North gulf is quite deep. Step 3: Determine erosion based on geographical features Since the South gulf has shallow water, the wave activity in that area will be affected by the ocean bottom, leading to higher and steeper waves, eventually causing more erosion. On the other hand, the North gulf, being deeper, will not be as affected by the ocean bottom, leading to less erosion. Step 4: Conclusion - North gulf experiences less erosion Considering the factors that impact erosion and the geographical features of the two gulfs, the North gulf, with its deeper water, will experience less erosion on the ocean bottom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This woman may be equipped with professional skills and perhaps valuable experience.

She is the symbol of what I call the Second Wave of Feminism. She is the modern woman who is determined to be. Her forerunner was the radical feminist who interpreted her trapped position as a female as oppression by the master class of men. Men, she believed, had created a domestic, servile role for women in order that men could have the career and the opportunity to participate in making the great decisions of society. Thus the radical feminist held that women through history had been oppressed and dehumanized, mainly because man chose to exploit his wife and the mother of his children. Sometimes it was deliberate exploitation and sometimes it was the innocence of never looking beneath the pretensions of life. The radical feminists found strength in banding together. Coming to recognize each other for the first time, they could explore their own identities, realize their own power, and view the male and his system as the common enemy. The first phases of feminism in the last five years often took on this militant, class-warfare tone. Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, and many others hammered home their ideas with a persistence that aroused and intrigued many of the brightest and most able women in the country. Consciousness-raising groups allowed women to explore both their identities and their dreams--and the two were often found in direct conflict. What is the stereotyped role of American women?

At first,the local people on the island were very kind to the European visitors,giving them allthe food and clothes they needed to survive.However,as the months passed,the local people became more and more unhappy with their guests,who were tricking and stealing from them.Finally the locals decided to stop helping.Without food or any way to leave the island,Columbus's group was soon in serious trouble. Luckily for Columbus,he had a book about the stars and planets on his ship.It described the movements of all the objects in the night sky.The book,written by a well-known German scientist,said there would be a total lunar eclipse on the evening of February 29,1504 and how long it would last. Columbus worked out the difference in time between Germ any and North America.He then had a meeting with the local leaders just before the eclipse would take place.In this meeting,Columbus told them his god was angry because the local people were no longer giving food.So his god would take away the moon to punish them.The moment Columbus finished talking,just as he had planned,the moon began disappearing.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Annette McKenzie wants the law changed to prevent under-18s being prescribed medication without parental consent. She said the current system was \\"letting young people down\\". She found out her daughter Britney Mazzoncini had been prescribed Propanol by her GP after she died of an overdose of the tablets in July last year. Ms McKenzie has lodged a petition at the Scottish Parliament. Speaking at the Public Petitions Committee, she said her campaign was not a \\"witch-hunt\\" against the doctor who treated her daughter. \\"When this happened with Britney, yes I was devastated, I was broken, but it also let me find a fault in the system where it is letting young people down,\\" she said. Britney, from Glasgow, suffered from depression and anxiety and was having suicidal impulses. She was prescribed a month's supply of the drug by her doctor last June. Sixteen days later, she took an overdose. Ms McKenzie said she had been unaware of the prescription and had mistaken side-effects, such as tiredness, as her daughter being lazy. She explained to MSPs: \\"My daughter didn't understand at 16 years old the severity and strength of the medication she was given. \\"She went to the doctor that day to ask for help. She didn't go expecting to be given pills.\\" She added: \\"I know a lot of people have concerns that my petition in particular will discourage young people from going to seek help from their doctor. \\"To say that a child won't go to the doctor to ask for help, I don't believe that, because a child at that age isn't going to a doctor to ask for pills, they are going to speak out, to be asked to be helped.\\" GPs do not need to seek parental consent to prescribe medication if the young person is deemed to be able to understand the nature of the treatment and potential consequences of the treatment. Ms McKenzie said the strength and effect of some mental health medications made it important that parents and guardians were \\"fully involved and aware of the circumstances, allowing them to support treatment\\" and safeguard their children by taking control of pills and dispensing them as required. \\"We're not just talking about my daughter being 16 here, we are talking about there being no age of consent,\\" she said. \\"If they deem you to be wise enough, they will send you away with medication.\\" The committee agreed to contact the Scottish government, the Scottish Association for Mental Health, the General Medical Council and a range of other relevant organisations.","completion":"A mother is asking for a change in the law so that doctors cannot give medicine to people under 18 without their parents knowing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Where was the man who's musical career was interrupted in 1896 principal conductor in 1907? Answer the above question based on the context below: Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

Re-establishing communication may clear up any misunderstandings. However, if you feel that your agent has deliberately lied or misled you about anything you consider material (e.g., the condition of a piece of property, the willingness of a seller or buyer, or the costs of services), you should pursue a complaint. Sometimes what strikes a seller as unprofessional conduct may seem minor to real estate professionals. Discuss your issue with an unbiased third party to gain another perspective. The broker is the party who owes you a fiduciary duty; the agent is merely the broker’s employee. You should therefore set up a meeting and make your complaints known. The agent may or may not be invited to attend. Write out your complaints and all of the details that you remember. Take down the name of any witnesses as well as their telephone numbers. Practice explaining your complaint. You want to be precise and clear. Be firm but not angry. If you believe the broker violated the contract, take out your copy of the contract and highlight the section you believe has been violated. Although the agent’s manager has access to the contract, the meeting will go more smoothly if you bring as much supporting documentation as possible. Other important documents include lease contracts, sales receipts, and communications between you and the agent. If you do not want the agent to attend, ask for him or her not to be present. If possible, you should willingly agree to have the agent at the meeting. Problems can be resolved more quickly if the supervisor or manager has both sides of the story. You can also gently correct any errors the agent makes in describing his side of the story. Apart from merely lodging a complaint against an agent, you can ask the managing broker to resolve your problem. For example, if the agent did not disclose a defect in the house, you could ask for an offsetting reduction in agent fees. Be open to settlement. Accepting less than you want does not mean that you cannot still file a complaint with your state’s licensing board. If you feel the meeting did not go well, ask if there is anyone else you can meet with. In large real estate offices you probably will not meet with the president initially, so there should be someone else to talk to. Ask to move up the chain of command.

Wildlife photographer Pickett Smith is taking photographs of the local flora and fauna as he canoes through a swamp surrounding an island containing the affluent mansion estate of the wealthy and influential Crockett family. Also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which Pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family. The grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch Jason intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of July and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. Due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, Jason sends a man named Grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs. Pickett later discovers Grover's corpse covered in snakebites in the swamp not far from the house. Despite this warning, Jason continues with his celebrations the next day. Early next morning, Michael Martindale sets out to check on a possible downed telephone line. He accidentally shoots himself in the leg and is rendered immobile by strange white moss hanging down from the surrounding trees. Tarantulas descend from the branches and kill him. Back on the estate, Jason's sister, Iris Martindale sends her son, Kenneth into the greenhouse to collect flowers for a centerpiece. As he gathers the flowers, he fails to notice dozens of tokay geckos entering behind him. The geckos swarm over the stacked shelves, knocking over numerous jars of poisonous chemicals, and the resulting toxic gas asphyxiates him. Seeing the danger posed by the animals, Pickett suggests that everyone should leave the island, but Jason is adamant that nothing will ruin his birthday.

Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning. The play is set in Napoleonic times. Act 1 There is heightened anticipation as the local gossips of the town discuss the developing relationship between Miss Phoebe Throssel and Valentine Brown. Phoebe then confesses to her sister, Susan, that Brown intends to drop by later that day, and both are certain he means to propose. When he finally does appear, it is not to ask for Phoebe's hand in marriage but to announce his intention to join the fight in Europe against Napoleon. This leaves the girls devastated. Act 2 Ten years after the departure of Brown, we find the girls have set up a school in order to pay the rent. Phoebe has not accepted any other suitor and has allowed herself to become an \\"Old Maid\\" and school mistress. Phoebe, however, longs for her youth, and the return of Captain Brown only deepens her melancholy. \\"I am tired of being lady-like,\\" she declares. With some encouragement from her maid, Patty, she creates the fictional character of Miss Livvy, a more energetic, flirtatious and naughty version of her younger self, and begins to tease Captain Brown who, captivated by her, persuades her and Susan to accompany him to the ball. Act 3 At the ball, and Phoebe is still playing the part of Miss Livvy. In this guise, she has captured the eyes of many of the young men and the scorn of ladies. However, Phoebe is now annoyed that Brown seems to prefer this unsubstantial 'young' flirt that she has created to her true personality and qualities. Her actions cause events to come to a head as her act is almost brought to light by the local gossiping girls Fanny Willoughby and Henrietta Turnbull. In a final confrontation with Captain Brown, we discover that he has found his love for Miss Phoebe and not for Miss Livvy, as he insists that \\"I have discovered for myself that the schoolmistress in her old maid's cap is the noblest Miss Phoebe of them all.\\" Act 4 Miss Livvy still hangs heavy over the sisters: having been created, she is now difficult to dispose of. The local gossips watch for any sign of Miss Livvy and frequently visit the sisters' home. Brown comes to ask for Phoebe s hand and is turned down without explanation. As a result, he becomes aware of the disguise and the sisters' plight and sets out to right all wrongs, even his own.","completion":"Part #1: Events in the story Usage: Who does Valentine Brown announce his intention to join the fight against?

Background: Matthew Fontaine Maury (January 14, 1806 - February 1, 1873) was an American astronomer, United States Navy officer, historian, oceanographer, meteorologist, cartographer, author, geologist, and educator. He was nicknamed \\"Pathfinder of the Seas\\" and \\"Father of Modern Oceanography and Naval Meteorology\\" and later, \\"Scientist of the Seas\\" for his extensive works in his books, especially The Physical Geography of the Sea (1855), the first such extensive and comprehensive book on oceanography to be published. Maury made many important new contributions to charting winds and ocean currents, including ocean lanes for passing ships at sea. Context: Maury was a descendant of the Maury family, a prominent Virginia family of Huguenot ancestry that can be traced back to 15th-century France. His grandfather (the Reverend James Maury) was an inspiring teacher to a future US president, Thomas Jefferson. Maury also had Dutch-American ancestry from the \\"Minor\\" family of early Virginia. He was born in 1806 in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near Fredericksburg; his parents were Richard Maury and Diane Minor Maury. The family moved to Franklin, Tennessee, when he was five. He wanted to emulate the naval career of his older brother, Flag Lieutenant John Minor Maury, who, however, caught yellow fever after fighting pirates as an officer in the US Navy. As a result of John's painful death, Matthew's father, Richard, forbade him from joining the Navy. Maury strongly considered attending West Point to get a better education than the Navy could offer at that time, but instead, he obtained a naval appointment through the influence of Tennessee Representative Sam Houston, a family friend, in 1825, at the age of 19. Maury joined the Navy as a midshipman on board the frigate Brandywine which was carrying the Marquis de La Fayette home to France, following La Fayette's famous visit to the United States. Almost immediately, Maury began to study the seas and to record methods of navigation. One of the experiences that piqued this interest was a circumnavigation of the globe on the USS Vincennes, his assigned ship and the first US warship to travel around the world. Question: What did he do after obtaining naval appointment? Answer:","completion":"After obtaining his naval appointment, Matthew Maury joined the Navy as a midshipman. He went on board the ship called Brandywine, which was taking the Marquis de La Fayette back to France after his visit to the United States. During his time in the Navy, Maury started to study the seas and learn about navigation. One of the exciting things he did was travel around the world on a ship called the USS Vincennes, which was the first US warship to make such a trip. This sparked his interest in studying oceans, winds, and currents, which would lead to his important work in oceanography and meteorology."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Q:Information: - The Second Punic War, also referred to as The Hannibalic War and (by the Romans) the War Against Hannibal, lasted from 218 to 201 BC and involved combatants in the western and eastern Mediterranean. This was the second major war between Carthage and the Roman Republic and its allied Italic socii, with the crucial participation of Numidian-Berber armies and tribes on both sides. The two states fought three major wars with each other over the course of their existence. They are called the \\"Punic Wars\\" because Rome's name for Carthaginians was \\"Poeni\\", derived from \\"Poenici\\" (earlier form of \\"Punici\\"), a reference to the founding of Carthage by Phoenician settlers. - Clastidium (modern Casteggio), was a village of the Anamares, in Gallia Cispadana, on the Via Postumia, 5 miles east of Iria (modern Voghera) and 31 miles west of Placentia. - The Roman Kingdom was the period of the ancient Roman civilization characterized by a monarchical form of government of the city of Rome and its territories. - Archimedes of Syracuse was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. Generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time, Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems, including the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, and the area under a parabola. - Lucius Annaeus Florus (c. 74 AD c. 130 AD) was a Roman historian who lived in the time of Trajan and Hadrian. He was born in Africa. - The spolia opima (\\"rich spoils\\") were the armour, arms, and other effects that an ancient Roman general stripped from the body of an opposing commander slain in single combat. The \\"spolia opima\\" were regarded as the most honourable of the several kinds of war trophies a commander could obtain, including enemy military standards and the peaks of warships. - Hegemony (or , or \\"leadership, rule\\") is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others. In ancient Greece (8th century BCE 6th century CE), \\"hegemony\\" denoted the politicomilitary dominance of a city-state over other city-states. The dominant state is known as the \\"hegemon\\". - The Insubres or Insubri were a Gaulish population settled in Insubria, in what is now the Italian region of Lombardy. They were the founders of Mediolanum (Milan). Though completely Gaulish at the time of Roman conquest, they were the result of the fusion of pre-existing Ligurian and Celtic population with Gaulish tribes who had come from what is now Central Europe. - The Battle of Clastidium was fought in 222 BC between a Roman Republican army led by the Roman consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus and the Insubres. Florus tells us that the Insubred were led by Viridomarus, or Britomartus as the name varies in translation. The Romans won the battle, and in the process, Marcellus earned the Spolia opima, one of the highest honors in ancient Rome, by killing the King in single combat. - Viridomarus or Britomartus as translations vary , ( died 222 BC ) was a Gaulish military leader who led an army against an army of the Roman Republic at the Battle of Clastidium . The Romans won the battle , and in the process , Marcus Claudius Marcellus , the Roman leader , earned the spolia opima by killing Viridomarus in single combat . - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Marcus Claudius Marcellus (c. 268 208 BC), five times elected as consul of the Roman Republic, was an important Roman military leader during the Gallic War of 225 BC and the Second Punic War. Marcellus gained the most prestigious award a Roman general could earn, the spolia opima, for killing the Gallic military leader and king Viridomarus in hand-to-hand combat in 222 BC at the battle of Clastidium. Furthermore, he is noted for having conquered the fortified city of Syracuse in a protracted siege during which Archimedes, the famous inventor, was killed. Marcus Claudius Marcellus died in battle in 208 BC, leaving behind a legacy of military conquests and a reinvigorated Roman legend of the \\"spolia opima\\". - Single combat is a duel between two single warriors which takes place in the context of a battle between two armies. Often, it is champion warfare, with the two considered the champions of their respective sides. Instances of single combat are known from Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages. The champions were often combatants who represented larger, spectator groups. Such representative contests and stories thereof are known worldwide.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. and the situation: John is a soil scientist. He has been studying the lands near Mississippi delta. He noticed cases of hypoxia in that are. He labeled that study as case A. To compare that to other areas he visited Arizona. There he didn't see any occurrence of hypoxia. He labeled that case as case B.

Also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which Pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family.

George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges.

Thanksgiving travelers told to 'pack your patience' as storm heads for east coast A nor’easter is expected to develop Wednesday along the east coast of the United States just as millions of travelers are heading to their Thanksgiving destinations. “I would pack your patience,” said Robert Sinclair Jr, of AAA New York. The storm, forecast to dump rain along the coast and snow inland, could cause delays at Northeast airports and along its busy highways. Precipitation was forecast to sweep in from the south Tuesday night into Wednesday morning and exit the region Thursday morning. Jeff Masters, chief meteorologist for Weather Underground, said coastal cities are likely to mostly receive rain, although he cautioned Monday afternoon that meteorologists would be keeping a close eye on the rain/snow line. “A small deviation in the track could change things dramatically,” he said. As of Monday, the highest amount of snow was expected to fall in northeastern Pennsylvania, the Catskills of upstate New York and into Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. Ten inches was possible in some places, forecasters said. Officials at the three major airports in the New York City area — Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty — were “monitoring weather forecasts carefully,” and were ready to take action if needed, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports. Sinclair said an estimated 41.3 million travelers were expected to hit the nation’s highways for the holiday weekend. That’s a 4.3 % increase over last year. Sinclair suggested travelers consider going on Tuesday or Thursday, instead of Wednesday, if they can.

Article: Speaking two languages can actually help offset some effects of aging on the brain, a new study has found. Researchers tested how long it took participants to switch from one cognitive task to another, something that's known to take longer for older adults, said lead researcher, Brian Gold, a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky. Gold's team compared task-switching speeds for younger and older adults, knowing they would find slower speeds in the older population because of previous studies. However, they found that older adults who spoke two languages were able to switch mental activities faster than those didn't . The study only looked at life-long bilinguals, defined in study as people who had spoken a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old. Gold and his team asked 30 people, either bilingual or monolingual , to have a series of tests. They found that bilingual people were not only able to switch tasks faster, they had different brain activity than their monolingual peers. Kristina called bilingualism \\"a beautiful natural experiment\\", because people grow up speaking two languages,and studies have shown that they get certain cognitive benefits from switching between languages and determining which to respond with based on what's going on around them. Gold said he grew up in Montreal, where he spoke French at school and English at home, prompting relatives to question whether his French language immersion would somehow hinder his ability to learn English. \\"Until very recently, learning a second language in childhood was thought of as dangerous,\\" he said. \\"Actually, it's beneficial. \\" Question: What's the main idea of the passage? Options: A: Researchers found that speaking two languages is important. B: Researchers found that bilingual people respond slowly.

The fact that the reviewer decided to uninstall the app also conveys their dissatisfaction with its performance and implies that the app has not served its intended purpose for them. Given the aforementioned information, I would rate this app as a \\"Not at all\\" in terms of recommending it to a friend. There might be other features or aspects of the app that work well, but considering the inability to read a common file format like CBR and the presence of better alternatives, this app does not seem to be a suitable choice.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In a distant galaxy, a starship searches for the evil Count Zarth Arn. Closing in on a planet, the ship is attacked by a mysterious weapon (a red blobby field) which drives the crew insane. Three escape pods launch during the attack, but the ship crashes into the atmosphere of the planet and is destroyed. Meanwhile, smuggler Stella Star and her sidekick Akton run into the Imperial Space Police, led by robot sheriff Elle. Akton and Stella escape by jumping into hyperspace. When they emerge, they discover an escape pod from the attacked starship, and in it, a sole survivor. Before they can escape, they are apprehended by the police, who tracked their hyperspace trail. Tried and convicted of piracy, they are each sentenced to life in prison on separate prison planets. When a riot breaks out at Stella's prison, she uses the diversion to escape the prison, which explodes shortly afterwards. Police Chief Thor recaptures her and she is taken to an orbiting ship, where she is reunited with Akton. They are contacted holographically by the Emperor of the Galaxy, who thanks them for recovering the starship survivor. They are offered clemency if they help find three more missing escape pods, one of which may contain the Emperor's only son. The Emperor is in a feud with Count Zarth Arn, who has a secret weapon hidden away on a planet somewhere. The weapon has immense power, and he can use it to take over the galaxy. The Emperor orders Stella and Akton to find the Count's weapon, and find and rescue his son. With Chief Thor and Elle accompanying them, Stella and Akton set off on their quest. They have a long way to travel, but Stella excitedly notes that hyperspace can make a journey that would've taken two months take only two hours.

By Emma Innes PUBLISHED: 07:01 EST, 29 April 2013 | UPDATED: 10:22 EST, 29 April 2013 A father-of-one who has survived cancer three times has described himself as the 'luckiest, unlucky' person alive. John Willis, 37, has battled testicular, stomach and lymph node cancers all in just three years. Miraculously, he has survived each one. John Willis (pictured with his wife Angela) has had testicular, stomach and lymph node cancers Incredibly, the stomach cancer was not related to the lymph node and testicular cancers, meaning that he developed two completely unconnected cancers. Professor Karol Sikora, a world renown oncologist, told MailOnline that the chances of being diagnosed with two different forms of cancer in a year is one in a million. Mr","completion":"Willis, a factory worker from Manchester, was first diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2010 after discovering a lump on his testicle during a self-examination. He underwent surgery to remove the cancerous testicle and received chemotherapy to ensure any remaining cells were eradicated. His wife Angela, 35, a nurse, supported him throughout the treatment, and they were overjoyed when doctors declared him cancer-free later that year. In 2011, however, John started experiencing severe stomach pain, and after numerous tests, doctors sadly informed him that he had stomach cancer. This shocked the family, as it was not related to the previous testicular cancer and considered incredibly rare and unlucky. John once again bravely embraced the challenge, receiving a series of radiation therapy sessions and an aggressive surgery to remove the affected part of his stomach. Following the surgery and additional treatment, John was in remission by mid-2012, which was a great relief to the family, who hoped that their cancer battles were over. Unfortunately, tragedy struck again in 2013, when John began experiencing persistent pain and swelling in his neck. Further tests confirmed lymph node cancer. He was referred to Professor Sikora, who quickly devised a personalized and aggressive treatment plan, combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Despite the odds stacked against him, John managed to beat cancer for the third time in just three years, aided by his indomitable spirit and the unwavering support of his wife Angela and their 10-year-old son, Charlie. Upon hearing of John's incredible journey, a local charity organized a Family Fun Day event to celebrate his success and raise funds for a much-needed family vacation. The Willis family were able to finally enjoy some well-deserved relaxation on an all-expenses-paid trip to Disney World in Florida. In an interview, John expressed his gratitude for overcoming these tough challenges and credited his recovery to the support he received from his family and the medical professionals who worked tirelessly to treat him. \\"I consider myself the luckiest, unlucky person alive,\\" he said. \\"Without the love and support of my wife and son, I wouldn't have been able to get through this ordeal. I owe my life to them, as well as to the incredible medical staff who never gave up on me, even when things seemed impossible.\\" Aware of the importance of early detection and the power of resilience, John now dedicates his spare time to visiting hospitals and support groups, sharing his story and giving hope to other cancer patients. He also actively participates in events and fundraises for local cancer charities, as well as national organizations such as Macmillan Cancer Support and Cancer Research UK, using his experience to help others going through similar battles. In a statement, Professor Sikora praised John's tenacity and perseverance. \\"John's ability to overcome not one but three different types of cancer in such a short time is truly remarkable,\\" he said. \\"His case serves as a testament to the importance of early detection and treatment, as well as the incredible power of the human spirit to endure and triumph in the face of seemingly insurmountable adversity.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating.

He is the younger brother of German international Mats Hummels, and the son of Hermann Hummels, a former footballer and manager. Can we infer the following? Jonas has one or more siblings.","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can infer that Jonas Hummels has at least one sibling. His brother, Mats Hummels, is a German international football player. It is worth noting that the given information does not reveal if Jonas has any other siblings apart from Mats. While it is possible that he might have more siblings, we cannot confirm it from the data provided. It is clear, however, that Jonas is a part of a football family, as his father Hermann Hummels is also a former footballer and manager. This suggests that football has been a significant aspect of Jonas' life, and his decision to pursue a career in football was likely influenced by his family's passion for the sport. Jonas Hummels was born on August 5th, 1990, and followed in the footsteps of his father and brother by playing as a central defender. He played professionally for SpVgg Unterhaching, a German football club based in Unterhaching, a suburb of Munich. Although he may not have achieved the same level of international success as his brother Mats, Jonas still made his own mark in the world of football. Mats Hummels, born on December 16th, 1988, is a highly accomplished professional football player known for his performances with both the German national team and domestic clubs, such as Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. With a career spanning over a decade, Mats has gained recognition as one of the top central defenders in Europe. He has won numerous domestic and international titles and has played a significant role in the success of his teams. Hermann Hummels, the father of Jonas and Mats, has also had a notable career in the football industry. He was a former football player and then transitioned into a managerial role, with experience not only in guiding and developing talent on the field but also in dealing with the organizational and strategic aspects of football clubs. This strong football background of the Hummels family demonstrates their immense passion for the sport and shows how football has been an influential part of their lives. In conclusion, based on the information provided, we can infer that Jonas Hummels has at least one sibling—his brother Mats Hummels, a renowned German international football player. The Hummels family is deeply rooted in the world of football, with both Jonas and Mats following in their father Hermann's footsteps and pursuing successful careers within the sport."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: Harshing on Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire (Lionsgate Films), the awkwardly titled Lee Daniels adaptation of an \\"urban fiction\\" best-seller, makes a critic feel almost as mean-spirited as Mary, the monstrously abusive mother of the film's eponymous heroine. Parked in front of the TV in the grim Harlem walk-up they share, Mary (played with a fearsome lack of vanity by stand-up comedian Mo'Nique) pelts her 16-year-old daughter, Claireece Precious Jones (Gabourey Sidibe), with cruel insults, imperious commands, and, whenever possible, heavy airborne objects. \\"I ain't done nothin'!\\" Precious protests, and the movie is at pains to prove her right: For the first hour at least, Precious is less a person who does things than an object to which things are done. Her absentee father, seen only once in a nauseating flashback sequence, rapes her on a regular basis; at 16, she's pregnant with his second child. Her daughter, who has Down syndrome, lives with a coldly disapproving grandmother; their visits last just long enough to fool the welfare inspector into issuing Mary's next check. In addition to being obese, unloved, and dirt-poor, Precious is also illiterate, though the public school she attends is so bad that she's managed to camouflage that fact through the eighth grade. In short, this girl's life is so abysmal that you feel the least you can do is like the movie she's in. It's not that there isn't anything to like about Precious, which at its best resembles its heroine: observant, large-spirited, and brave. The director, Lee Daniels (Shadowboxer), puts on his hip boots and wades into grimmer territory than any recent film I can think of, and his fearless leading ladies, Mo'Nique and Sidibe, wade right in with him. But Daniels' methodical commitment to abjection, his need to shove the reality of Precious' life in our faces and wave it around till we acknowledge its awfulness, winds up robbing the audience (and, to some extent, the actors) of all agency. Daniels is not above cutting from an image of incestuous rape to a shot of greasy pork sizzling on the stove: Her father treats her like meat, get it? In its eagerness to drag us through the lower depths of human experience, Precious leaves no space for the audience to breathe or to draw our own conclusions. For a film about empowerment and self-actualization, it wields an awfully large cudgel. Precious is expelled from school when the news of her second pregnancy comes out, but the principal refers her to an alternative learning center, Each One Teach One, where an impossibly beautiful and patient teacher named Blu Rain (Paula Patton) leads a reading and writing workshop for dropout girls. Ms. Rain is an emissary from another world, where slender, caring, soft-spoken women (Ms. Rain, as it turns out, is a lesbian) sip wine and play Scrabble and, in Precious' words, \\"talk like TV channels I don't watch.\\" Precious' ability to read and write keeps pace with her growing belly as she slowly learns to trust Ms. Rain and her raucous, foulmouthed, but closeknit classmates. (All the Each One Teach One girls are deftly sketched and well-cast, as is an exasperated social worker played with surprising finesse by Mariah Carey.) But when Precious' baby finally arrives, she's forced to depend once more on her toxic disaster of a mother. As Precious carries the fragile newborn into that awful apartment, you want to rush the screen and lock her out to keep them safe, and the scene that follows shamelessly exploits that protective impulse. I don't like when children are used as decoys to lure a movie audience into a trap. Advertisement Seeded throughout Precious are brief dream sequences in which the stolidly joyless heroine imagines herself as a performer in a music video, a movie star on the red carpet, etc. Whether these are meant to be critiques of a mass culture that trades in escapist fantasy or simply pathos-ridden glimpses into Precious' impoverished mental life is never clear. But like the outlandish badness of the mother character, the overdetermined tawdriness of these scenes does the movie and its heroine a disservice. Daniels and his screenwriter, Geoffrey Fletcher, are so eager to wring uplift from Precious' story that they're willing to manipulate us to get it. Daniels and Fletcher no doubt intended for their film to lend a voice to the kind of protagonist too often excluded from American movie screens: a poor, black, overweight single mother from the inner city. But in offering up their heroine's misery for the audience's delectation, they've created something uncomfortably close to poverty porn.

Written by Geoffrey Fletcher, based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Running time: 109 minutes. Rated R (for child abuse, including sexual assault, and pervasive language). Printer-friendly » E-mail this to a friend » Precious has shut down. She avoids looking at people, she hardly ever speaks, she's nearly illiterate. Inside her lives a great hurt, and also her child, conceived in a rape. She is fat. Her clothes are too tight. School is an ordeal of mocking cruelty. Home is worse. Her mother, defeated by life, takes it out on her daughter. After Precious is raped by her father, her mother, is angry not at the man, but at the child for \\"stealing\\" him. There's one element in the film that redeems this landscape of despair. That element is hope. Not the hope of Precious, but that of two women who want better for her. It's not that Precious \\"shows promise.\\" I think it's that these women, having in their jobs seen a great deal, can hardly imagine a girl more obviously in pain. That is the starting point for \\"Precious,\\" a great American film that somehow finds an authentic way to move from these beginnings to an inspiring ending. Gabourey \\"Gabby\\" Sidibe, a young actress in her debut performance as Precious, says, \\"I know this girl. I know her in my family, I know her in my friends, I've seen her, I've lived beside this girl.\\" We may have seen her, too, if we looked. People often don't really look. They see, evaluate, dismiss. Sidibe is heartbreaking as Precious, that poor girl. Three other actresses perform so powerfully in the film that academy voters will be hard-pressed to choose among them. Audiences may be hard-pressed to recognize them. The comedian Mo'Nique plays Mary, Precious' chain-smoking couch potato of a mother, treating her daughter like a domestic servant and turning a blind eye on years of abuse. Paula Patton is Ms. Rain, Precious' teacher, who is able to see through the girl's sullen withdrawal and her vulgarities, and wonder what pain it may be masking. Mariah Carey is Ms. Weiss, a social worker. This casting looks almost cynical on paper, as if reflecting old Hollywood days when stars were slipped into \\"character roles\\" with a wink. But Lee Daniels, the director, didn't cast them for their names, and actually doesn't use any of their star qualities. He requires them to act. Somehow he was able to see beneath the surface and trust that they had within the emotional resources to play these women, and he was right. Daniels began his career by producing \\"Monster's Ball,\\" in which Halle Berry shed her glamour and found such depths that she won an Oscar. Daniels must have an instinct for performances waiting to flower. Carey and Patton are equal with Sidibe in screen impact; the film holds the girl in the center of their attempt to save her future. Why would a teacher and a social worker go to such lengths to intervene? They must see tragic victims of abuse every day. Mary, the mother, is perhaps not a bad woman but simply one defeated by the forces she now employs against her daughter. Mo'Nique is frighteningly convincing. The film is a tribute to Sidibe's ability to engage our empathy. Her work is still another demonstration of the mystery of some actors, who evoke feelings in ways beyond words and techniques. She so completely creates the Precious character that you rather wonder if she's very much like her. You meet Sidibe, who is engaging, outgoing and 10 years older than her character, and you're almost startled. She's not at all like Precious, but in her first performance, she not only understands this character but knows how to make her attract the sympathy of her teacher, the social worker -- and ourselves. I don't know how she does it but there you are. My interview with “Gabby” Sidibe. ||||| Precious Is the Diary of a Sad Black Woman Pushing the limits of taste, but locating the heart—and hell—of its heroine's struggle In her broad outlines, Claireece Precious Jones risks sounding like the epitome of ghetto cliché: an obese, illiterate 16-year-old; mother to a four-year-old Down syndrome daughter and now pregnant again; physically and psychologically abused by her mother; repeatedly raped by her father, who is, also, the father of her own two children. Precious—as she prefers to be called—is the central figure in the poet Sapphire's bestselling 1996 novel Push, an homage of sorts to The Color Purple (which it directly references and also mirrors in its diaristic style), set in the pre-gentrification Harlem of the mid-1980s. And it's a testament to Sapphire's affecting prose (written in Precious's own words and dialect) that her protagonist emerges as something more than a mere statistic or representative—that we understand how Precious's story is, for all its commonalities with other abused black women, uniquely her own. Director Lee Daniels's film adaptation (which has been retitled Precious since its Sundance premiere, and also acquired two high-profile \\"presenters\\" in Tyler Perry and Oprah) is a somewhat blunter, but nevertheless effective object. Working from screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher's faithful adaptation, Daniels cultivates an aesthetic that is often more grotesque than artful, sometimes artfully grotesque (like a Courbet painting), and rarely delivered with less than a sledgehammer thwack. Bleak though it was on the page, the apartment shared by Precious (newcomer Gabourey Sidibe) and her layabout welfare mother, Mary (Mo'Nique), here appears like a Lenox Avenue Grey Gardens, with a television perpetually tuned to The 100,000 Pyramid and curtains that don't seem to have parted since whatever decade Mary last left the premises. When Daniels flashes back to Precious's horrifying rapes, the wide-angle close-ups of her father's heaving body, and of fried chicken sizzling on the stove, feel like outtakes from one of Rudy Ray Moore's outré blaxploitation farces (or from Daniels's own risible, little-seen debut feature, Shadowboxer, featuring Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr. as oedipal hired assassins). And when Precious enrolls at the alternative school where a teacher improbably named Blu Rain (Paula Patton) inspires her to stand and deliver, the classrooms are wreathed in ethereal light. Hothouse melodrama one moment, kitchen-sink (and frying-pan-to-the-head) realism the next, with eruptions of incongruous slapstick throughout, this may be Daniels's stab at finding a cinematic analog for the novel's inventive, naïf-art language—a film style, like Precious's writing style, seemingly being made up as it goes along. Yet even when the movie is at its most schizoid, Precious still packs a wallop. What Daniels lacks as a craftsman, he makes up for in his willingness to put the lives of abused and defeated black women on the screen with brute-force candor and a lack of sentimentality. Where Push the novel echoed The Color Purple the novel, Precious the movie operates as something of a corrective to Steven Spielberg's 1985 film, with its narrative sanitizing and artery-clogging Quincy Jones score. Its own inspirational touches notwithstanding (not for nothing did it cop the audience awards at Sundance and Toronto earlier this year), Precious is less about overcoming adversity than about survival—a battle the movie does not begin to pretend can be won in two hours of screen time. No slumdog millionaires here, Daniels's movie puts us through hell—Precious's hell—and leaves us somewhere like limbo. A former casting director, Daniels shows undeniable savoir faire with his actors, a mix of musicians and comedians effectively cast against type, from a dark-haired, deglamorized Mariah Carey as a tough-love social worker to a subtle Lenny Kravitz as an attentive male nurse. The picture belongs, however, to the gale-force Mo'Nique, who transforms an ostensibly one-note monster mom into a complex portrait of a psychologically damaged woman (no matter that Daniels seems to have edited her most showstopping scene in a blender), and to the magnanimous Sidibe, who carries the alternately exhausting and exhilarating narrative on her formidable shoulders. For most of the movie, her stoically beautiful face stays wrought tight in a mask of sadness and self-loathing. When she relaxes those muscles ever so slightly—one of the movie's few subtle touches—it is like a weight of centuries has been lifted. ||||| Summary:","completion":"\\"Precious,\\" directed by Lee Daniels, is a film adaptation of the bestselling novel \\"Push\\" by Sapphire, which provides a harrowing coming-of-age story set in pre-gentrification Harlem in the 1980s. The film follows the difficult life of 16-year-old Claireece Precious Jones, played by Gabourey Sidibe, who endures physical and psychological abuse and extreme poverty. The movie powerfully portrays her experiences with abuse, illiteracy, and overcoming adversity while attending an alternative school led by teacher Blu Rain (Paula Patton). Director Daniels has a unique approach to blending the genres of melodrama and realism, which can occasionally feel disjointed but still leaves a significant impact. The film is driven by strong performances from actors like Mo'Nique, who plays Precious's abusive mother Mary, as well as Mariah Carey, who portrays a social worker named Ms. Weiss. The film challenges the audience's preconceptions about those living in similar circumstances and emphatically shows the struggle to survive in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A teenager who became the youngest person in Britain to have a full sex change is hoping to be crowned Miss England. After four suicide attempts, Jackie Green, 18, from Leeds, underwent surgery to become a woman on her 16th birthday. Ever since she was a toddler, Jackie - who was. born a boy and named Jack - always acted like a girl. and insisted on wearing feminine clothes and playing with girls’ toys. Teenage dreams: Jackie Green, pictured on TV show Lorraine Live today, hopes to be crowned Miss England just two years after she underwent a full sex change operation. Her parents came to terms with the. fact she was really a girl trapped inside a boy’s body and spent, in. total, £28,000 on her treatment. At her lowest point, the teenager even threatened to cut off her own genitals with a knife. Now Jackie has her sights set on a model future as she dreams of a place in the Miss England semi-finals. She said: 'It’s a little strange because there are so many other really gorgeous girls in the competition. 'It would be amazing to win and I just hope it makes other people see that there is a lot more to life than getting bullied.'

Prayers answered: Jackie, pictured just before surgery, had her operation on her 16th birthday in Thailand. She added: 'When I was younger I never really. had anyone else to look up to in the same position. I would have never. imagined this, not in a million years.' Her supportive mother Susie added: 'If she went on to win I would be very proud of her. 'She has stuck herself out there and knew she would get flak for it. Some comments on websites haven’t. been very kind but she is aware of that and thinks why should that stop. me, I’m the same as anyone else.' Jackie is currently leading the public vote in her heat of the popular beauty contest.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the question below: As a balloon deflates there is more or less air pressure forcing air out? Assuming that: Exhaling, or breathing out, decreases the size of the chest, which increases air pressure inside the lungs. The answer to this question is:","completion":"As a balloon deflates, there is more air pressure forcing air out. To understand this concept, let's first examine the basic principles of gas and air pressure. A balloon is made of a stretchable material, usually rubber or mylar, which is filled with a certain amount of air or gas. When you inflate a balloon, you are increasing the volume of its interior while keeping the number of gas molecules constant. As the volume of the interior space grows, the gas molecules inside become more widely dispersed and thereby exert less pressure on the inner walls of the balloon. In other words, when a balloon inflates, the internal air pressure decreases as the volume increases. Now let's discuss what happens when you deflate a balloon. Deflating a balloon means releasing the air or gas trapped inside, which results in a reduction of the interior volume. As the volume shrinks, the gas molecules inside the balloon become more densely packed. This higher concentration of gas molecules increases the frequency at which they collide with the inner walls of the balloon, resulting in an increase in air pressure. The air pressure inside the balloon becomes greater than the external air pressure, which creates a force that pushes the air or gas out of the balloon. Deflating a balloon can be further understood in the context of Boyle's Law. Boyle's Law states that the pressure and volume of a gas are inversely proportional to one another when the temperature and the number of gas molecules remain constant. In the case of a deflating balloon, as its volume decreases, the pressure inside increases, which is in accordance with Boyle's Law. This relationship explains why there is more air pressure forcing air out when a balloon deflates. Returning to your assumption about exhaling, one can draw a parallel with the deflating balloon. When exhaling, the size of the chest cavity decreases, causing an increase in the pressure inside the lungs. This increase in pressure forces the air out of the lungs and into the atmosphere, similar to the process that occurs when a balloon deflates. In summary, as a balloon deflates, there is more air pressure forcing air out due to the reduction in the interior volume, the increased concentration of gas molecules, and the application of Boyle's Law, which explains the inverse relationship between pressure and volume in a gas. This greater internal air pressure is responsible for pushing the air or gas out of the balloon, comparable to the process of exhaling in the human body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \\"We were desperate,\\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \\"We are very satisfied with the results,\\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians... Why did the state hospital refuse to practice surgeon for Ziad Matouk? A) Because he couldn't afford the fee at a public hospital. B) Because the hospital didn't accept dangerous patients.

If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength .

We will start with the given equation: 147 = -1412*k + 1433*k Combine the terms with k: 147 = (1433 - 1412)*k Step 2: Calculate the coefficient of k. To find out the coefficient of k, subtract 1412 from 1433: 1433 - 1412 = 21 So the equation now looks like: 147 = 21*k Step 3: Solve for k. To solve for k, divide both sides of the equation by its coefficient (21): 147 / 21 = 21*k / 21 k = 7 The value of k is 7."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Use the following highlights to write an article: A Bracken Cave meshweaver was found in a cave uncovered by construction in the middle of a San Antonio area highway in 2012. The dime-sized, translucent arachnid was only the second ever discovered. Biologists ordered the cave sealed, work stopped and the construction contract was terminated. Years and at least 30million later, the project will finally break ground in 2015, though it was originally slated for completion in 2012.","completion":"Title: The Remarkable Discovery of the Bracken Cave Meshweaver: An Environmental Mystery in the Heart of San Antonio In 2012, in the midst of energetic construction work on a bustling highway in the San Antonio area, a surprising discovery brought all operations to a standstill. Buried deep within the earth revealed by the construction was a cave – a hidden kingdom that was the home of an extraordinarily rare creature: a Bracken Cave Meshweaver. The Bracken Cave Meshweaver, a dime-sized, nearly translucent arachnid, was a species only seen once before in the annals of biological history. Unveiled from its obscurity by the churn of bulldozers and excavators, the discovery of this elusive creature in the heart of San Antonio was a significant and unexpected event for the world of biology. The presence of the Meshweaver led to a sudden, almost dramatic, halt in construction activity. The gaze of the scientific world was drawn at once to this small area in San Antonio, and biologists, declaring the area a site of significant biological interest, promptly ordered the cave to be sealed off from human interference. A remarkable process followed the Meshweaver's rediscovery. Construction work was suspended indefinitely, and the contract was duly terminated. The inconspicuous arachnid had unwittingly disrupted an extensive highway project, and the protection of its habitat was given priority over infrastructural progress. The unexpected intervention of Mother Nature, replete with its challenges, naturally came at a cost. Fast forward to 2015, the standstill had continued for years and had, by experts' estimates, cost at least 30 million. Nonetheless, with comprehensive biological surveys conducted and stringent protection measures put in place for the cave-dwelling creature, the highway project was finally prepped to break ground. The entire episode leading to the grand resumption signified a triumph of nature conservation but also highlighted the incompatibilities that surfaces between infrastructural development and biodiversity preservation. The highway project's original timeline had slated it for completion in 2012. However, the extraordinary find pushed this target forward by three years. The case of the Bracken Cave Meshweaver is a potent illustration of how the balance between human ambition and biological preservation can be disrupted and the fallout that can arise from such instances. The discovery underlined the crucial need to incorporate environmental considerations and biodiversity audits within the planning stages of infrastructure projects. In the middle of urban San Antonio, the almost translucent, dime-sized arachnid gained an unexpected relevance. The Meshweaver, lying oblivious to its profound impact, serves as a symbol – a tangible reminder of the unseen biodiversity that thrives within our often-overlooked underground biospheres. The Meshweaver's journey from an obscure cave-dweller to a significant influencer in the world of construction and infrastructure indeed paints a captivating tale of the interesting discoveries that can exist beneath the surface. It essentially makes a strong case for a science-led approach in development planning, to better identify and mitigate such environmental surprises, prioritize species protection, and effectively balance in our march towards progress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He becomes the first person to ever complete the Trinity Great Court run: running around the court in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12. Abrahams achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with a famous Gilbert and Sullivan soprano, Sybil (Alice Krige).Meanwhile in Scotland, Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), born in China of Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie (Cheryl Campbell) disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running. But Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary.Abrahams and Liddell meet for the first time in London in June 1923 when they first race against each other in a British open. Liddell beats Abrahams who takes it extremely badly. But Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm), a professional trainer whom Abrahams had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters (John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson). In their meeting with Abrahams, the Cambridge masters allege it is ungentlemanly for an amateur to \\"play the tradesman\\" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams realizes this is a cover for their anti-Semitism and class entitlement, and dismisses their concern.Meanwhile, when Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God.

Information: - Christian Schad ( August 21 , 1894 -- February 25 , 1982 ) was a German painter associated with Dada and the New Objectivity movement . Considered as a group , Schad 's portraits form an extraordinary record of life in Vienna and Berlin in the years following World War I. - George Grosz (July 26, 1893 July 6, 1959) was a German artist known especially for his caricatural drawings and paintings of Berlin life in the 1920s. He was a prominent member of the Berlin Dada and New Objectivity group during the Weimar Republic. He emigrated to the United States in 1933, and became a naturalized citizen in 1938. Abandoning the style and subject matter of his earlier work, he exhibited regularly and taught for many years at the Art Students League of New York. In 1956 he returned to Berlin where he died. - The New Objectivity (in ) was a movement in German art that arose during the 1920s as a reaction against expressionism. The term was coined by Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub, the director of the in Mannheim, who used it as the title of an art exhibition staged in 1925 to showcase artists who were working in a post-expressionist spirit. As these artistswho included Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, and George Groszrejected the self-involvement and romantic longings of the expressionists, Weimar intellectuals in general made a call to arms for public collaboration, engagement, and rejection of romantic idealism. - Max Beckmann (February 12, 1884 December 27, 1950) was a German painter, draftsman, printmaker, sculptor, and writer. Although he is classified as an Expressionist artist, he rejected both the term and the movement. In the 1920s, he was associated with the New Objectivity (\\"Neue Sachlichkeit\\"), an outgrowth of Expressionism that opposed its introverted emotionalism. What is the relationship between 'christian schad' and 'expressionism'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Christian Schad was a German painter who was associated with the Dada and New Objectivity movements, rather than with Expressionism. Although Expressionism and New Objectivity were both significant art movements in Germany during the early 20th century, they had contrasting styles and philosophies. Expressionism focused on the artist's subjective emotions and experiences, often using distorted and exaggerated imagery to evoke an emotional response in the viewer. In contrast, the New Objectivity movement, with which Christian Schad was associated, emerged as a reaction against Expressionism. Artists within the New Objectivity, like Schad, rejected the self-involvement and romantic longings of the Expressionists, instead opting for a more realistic and objective representation of their subjects, often addressing social and political themes. While Schad's work did not fall under the Expressionist movement, his career and artistic style were influenced by the broader cultural and artistic environment in Germany at the time. Schad's portraits, which form an extraordinary record of life in Vienna and Berlin in the years following World War I, demonstrate his commitment to accurately depicting the world and people around him, thus aligning more closely with the New Objectivity movement than with Expressionism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She shifted her support to Barack Obama after Clinton lost the Democratic primary, but her admiration for Clinton never faded. “She has a wonderful sense of fashion for herself.” “I think she is a very attractive woman. I think she has beautiful skin, beautiful smile, beautiful eyes,” von Furstenberg said. “She’s a woman of substance, you know, and how can you judge her hair and her clothes when she goes on—as secretary of state she goes on all the time? I mean, nobody would do that to a man. I mean, what is that? She has a wonderful sense of fashion for herself. She has a wonderful sense of the woman that she is and it’s all about the substance and it’s all about the honesty and it’s all about the truth.” During her 2008 presidential bid and her time in the State Department, Clinton relied on oft-mocked pantsuits, which aren’t a part of von Furstenberg’s fashion vocabulary.

A:","completion":"A: Linga stones, also known as lingam or Shiva linga, are abstract symbols predominantly associated with the Hindu god, Lord Shiva. The term \\"linga\\" is derived from the Sanskrit term \\"lingam,\\" which means \\"a symbol or sign.\\" These stones are revered as sacred and symbolize the divine, creative energy of Lord Shiva, who is considered one of the three major deities within the Hindu pantheon, alongside Brahma and Vishnu. The symbolism of Shiva linga is multifaceted and holds deep spiritual significance in Hinduism. Here are some of its various meanings and associations: 1. Formlessness and Infinity: The linga stones typically represent the formless aspect of Lord Shiva, manifesting the idea that the divine transcends all physical forms. This notion underlies the Hindu belief that everything originates from the formless and eventually returns to it. In this context, the linga is often said to represent the infinite nature of the universe. 2. Creation and Cosmic Energy: Another key aspect of linga stones is their association with the process of creation. According to Hindu tradition, the universe is cyclically created, maintained, and destroyed by the cosmic dance performed by Lord Shiva. By symbolizing his creative energy in the form of linga stones, they signify the continuing process of life and creation. 3. Union of Masculine and Feminine Energies: The Shiva linga is also interpreted as a symbol of the union of masculine (Shiva) and feminine (Shakti) energies. This fusion is considered essential in maintaining the balance of the universe. The base structure on which the linga stone rests is called the yoni, representing the goddess Shakti. This symbolic union signifies the interdependence of both energies in the cosmic cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth. 4. Fertility and Life Force: The linga stones are often associated with fertility and the life force, owing to the phallic shape of the stone. In ancient times, it was believed that the linga and yoni signified the life-generating and life-sustaining powers of the universe. Their worship was aimed at gaining blessings for creation, abundance, and fertility in life. 5. Spiritual Energy and Meditation: In certain spiritual practices and meditative techniques, the Shiva linga serves as a focal point for concentration and heightened spiritual energy. It is believed that meditating on the linga can bring one closer to the divine and help in the attainment of a higher state of consciousness. Linga stones are not only central to Hinduism but are also found in the Jain and Buddhist traditions. However, they hold the most prominence within the Shaivism sect of Hinduism, which focuses specifically on the worship of Lord Shiva. In conclusion, the Shiva linga or linga stones are sacred symbols deeply associated with Lord Shiva, representing his formless, creative, and cosmic energies. These abstract symbols hold profound spiritual significance in Hinduism, reflecting the infinite, creative nature of the divine, the union of masculine and feminine energies, and the life-generating powers of the universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","completion":"The premise under discussion states, \\"It is uncertain what impact this assumption will have on net changes in surplus.\\" By examining this statement, it becomes clear that it explicitly notes uncertainty surrounding how the assumption will affect the net changes in surplus. This means that the effects or implications that this assumption will have on the surplus are presently unclear, ambiguous, or hard to predict with confidence. On to the hypothesis in question: \\"The assumptions will have a major impact on surplus\\". Here, the hypothesis foregrounds a direct, large, and significant influence of the assumptions on the surplus. It emphasizes a decisive and considerable level of impact that would nominally expect to be observable and identifiable. Let's compare the premise and the hypothesis: the premise conveys uncertainty (i.e., a lack of sureness) in the impact, while the hypothesis proclaims a major impact. Both statements are conversing on the same theme - the effect of the assumption on the surplus. However, they approach it differently: one denotes uncertainty, the other proclaims definitiveness. To extrapolate the hypothesis from the premise is to suggest certainty where only uncertainty is expressed. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). it is not possible to tell. The premise, stating uncertainty about the impact, does not provide enough information to definitively support or refute the hypothesis that suggests a major and decisive impact. There's a possible situation that the assumption could greatly affect the surplus, and it's also possible that the effects might be minor or negligible. Without more explicit information, we cannot determine which is the case.

Math problem: Solve -10133*b = -10008*b + 10625 for b. What is the solution?","completion":"Okay little buddy, let's solve this math problem together. We want to find out what \\"b\\" is. Here's what we have: -10133 * b = -10008 * b + 10625 First, let's move all the \\"b\\" terms to one side. We can do this by adding 10008 * b to both sides of the equation. This will give us: (-10133 * b) + (10008 * b) = 10625 Now, let's combine the \\"b\\" terms: (-10133 + 10008) * b = 10625 When we do that, we get: -125 * b = 10625 Now, we want to find out what \\"b\\" is, so we need to get it by itself. We do this by dividing both sides by -125: b = 10625 / -125 When we do the division, we get: b = -85 So the solution to the math problem is b = -85.

What is the relationship between 'so real ' and 'i wanna be with you'? Answer:","completion":"\\"So Real\\" and \\"I Wanna Be with You\\" are songs by American singer, songwriter, and actress Mandy Moore. Both songs relate to Mandy Moore's early music career, showcasing her pop style and establishing her as a notable artist in the late 1990s and early 2000s. \\"So Real\\" is the title track of Mandy Moore's debut album, released in 1999 by Epic Records. It was written by Tony Battaglia and Shaun Fisher and represents Moore's third and final overall single from the album, though it was the second international single released. \\"So Real\\" was a moderate success, reaching number 21 on the ARIA chart in July 2000.

After the bride and groom arrived , there was a non - alcoholic toast and they cut the cake . Everyone had some cake while we all watched the bride and groom open their presents . Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: What best explain 's the wedding 's budget ?","completion":"To determine the best explanation for the wedding's budget, I will analyze the cost-related details mentioned in the passage. 1. Tacky decorations from Oriental Trading: This indicates that the wedding decorations were inexpensive and low-cost. 2. Reception held at the community center: Hosting a wedding at a community center is usually more affordable than renting a private venue. 3. Reception lasting for 45 minutes with punch and snacks: This is a short duration for a reception, and only serving punch, mixed nuts, and mints suggests cost-saving measures were taken with regard to food and beverages. 4. A non-alcoholic toast: Not serving alcohol also reduces the expenses associated with the wedding. 5. Guests watch the bride and groom open their presents: This might indicate the lack of professional entertainment at the event, which can be an expense. After examining the factors listed above, it is clear that the wedding's budget was likely limited or lower than average.

Options: - pool hall - mediterranean sea - seafood restaurant - gulf of mexico - south pacific Explain why a human would choose \\"mediterranean sea\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"Mediterranean Sea\\" to answer the question above because it is the most logical and plausible option among the choices provided. Here's an explanation for each option: 1. Pool hall: This is not a feasible answer as sharks are marine creatures and cannot be found in a pool hall, which is typically an indoor gaming facility for playing billiards or pool. 2. Mediterranean Sea: This is the correct answer because it is the only option representing a natural body of water in which sharks, particularly certain species such as the great white shark and shortfin mako shark, can be found. Furthermore, Greece is a country located in southeastern Europe, and it borders the Mediterranean Sea. So, if you were Greek and saw a shark while swimming or boating, it would likely be in the Mediterranean Sea. 3. Seafood restaurant: While seafood restaurants do serve dishes made from fish or other marine creatures, including sharks, you would not encounter a live shark inside a restaurant. The context of the question implies you are encountering a live shark, making this option incorrect. 4. Gulf of Mexico: This location is ruled out as an option because it is far away from Greece and not connected to the Mediterranean Sea. If you were Greek, you would most likely be near the Mediterranean Sea and not the Gulf of Mexico when encountering a shark. 5. South Pacific: Similar to the Gulf of Mexico, the South Pacific Ocean is situated far from Greece, making it very unlikely for a Greek person to come across a shark in this region.

But his feelings had been only natural. God created humans and gave them sexual desire. Wasn't it okay to want to have sex, as long as you didn't actually do it? Then he remembered the passage from Matthew 5:28. But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart. At the end of the hymn, Greg stepped back and Dr. Huff went to the podium and said a prayer. Then there were announcements, two more hymns, and a chorus. After the offering, it was time for the choir to sing their anthem. When Greg motioned to the choir to stand, Cynthia smiled at him from the Alto section. She was so incredibly beautiful.

Movie title: Undisputed II: Last Man Standing Context: Visiting the Russian Federation for a series of boxing matches, George \\"Iceman\\" Chambers is subsequently framed for possession of cocaine and sent to prison. There, he discovers a series of illegal full-contact Mixed Martial Arts matches dominated by inmate Yuri Boyka. The prison officials arrange these fights and place large side-bets to make a personal profit, often at the expense of the fighters.Once inside, the warden and legal adviser for Chambers state that if he fights Yuri in the ring, he will likely get an expedited appeal and early release. He initially refuses, but after spending time in demeaning physical labor in the prison's sewer system and experiencing firsthand the brutality of the guards, he reluctantly agrees. He is rescued from both forms of humiliation by a crippled inmate, Crot (Eli Danker). Both fighters train hard for the match, though Chambers still relies on his boxing background while Boyka prepares a series of deadly kicks, throws, and grappling combinations designed to humiliate his opponent in the ring. Prior to the fight however, Boyka's friends force George's cellmate, Steven, who is acting as his cornerman, to spike his water with a light sedative during the fight.During the fight, Chambers is somewhat taken by surprise at the flurry and variety of Boyka's attacks, but manages to hold his own through the first round by keeping his distance, staying calm, and dealing out painful punching combinations whenever possible. At the end of the first round, Steven slips the drugged water into Chambers' mouth and he takes a few sips. During the second round, he starts to lose his focus and begins taking more and more punishment until Boyka knocks him out with a devastating flying kick. Following the fight, Steven kills himself out of guilt.After the fight, Chambers (having learnt of the truth from Crot) confronts Boyka, believing that he was responsible for drugging him, and the warden, for going back on the deal.

Here is a question about this article: Because the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar n–p–n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent p–n–p transistor. GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors. It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high-frequency applications. A relatively recent FET development, the high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT), has a heterostructure (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz. HEMTs based on gallium nitride and aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications. What is the answer to this question: What are common applications of HEMT?","completion":"A HEMT, or high-electron-mobility transistor, is a special type of transistor that is really good at working very fast with very little noise. This makes them perfect for jobs where they need to deal with high frequencies.

The action scenes are passable, but the plot is sloppy. Who decided to publish this amateurish attempt? Here's hoping the author gets better as the books continue. Not that I will be reading them (to my kid). Even for children, life's too short to read bad books; there are too many better ones to switch to. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The overall tone of the product review is negative. Analyzing the reviewer's comments, we can observe several key elements that provide evidence for this conclusion. 1. Character Development: The reviewer expresses that \\"the characters are all woefully underdeveloped,\\" which implies dissatisfaction with the depth and complexity of the characters in the book. By using the term \\"woefully,\\" they emphasize their disappointment in this aspect. 2. Remark on the hero: The mention of even the hero being underdeveloped creates an expectation that, as the protagonist, the hero would be more developed than the other characters. This further emphasizes the reviewer's negative viewpoint on the overall character development. 3. Action Scenes and Plot: While the reviewer acknowledges that the action scenes are \\"passable,\\" they immediately follow this statement with criticism about the \\"sloppy\\" plot. This reveals that, though there may be some adequate aspects in the book, the reviewer still finds significant flaws that overshadow any potential positives. 4. Questioning the Publishing Decision: The reviewer probes, \\"Who decided to publish this amateurish attempt?\\" This rhetorical question highlights their dissatisfaction with the book and implies that it should not have even been published in the first place. 5. Potential for Improvement: Despite their overall criticism, the reviewer does mention that they hope the author will improve as their work progresses. While this statement may be seen as a silver-lining, it is quickly negated by their declaration that they will not continue to read the future books. This solidifies the negative tone and indicates that there is no interest in giving future works a chance. 6. Final Thoughts: The reviewer ends their review with a recommendation that life is too short to read bad books and suggests finding better alternatives. This wraps up their critique with a clear message: they do not feel that the book is worth anyone's time, especially not for children. In summary, based on these observations, the tone of the product review is undoubtedly negative, as the reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with several elements of the book and recommends seeking better alternatives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Born in Jamaica, she moved when she was 13, along with her siblings, to live with her parents in Syracuse, New York. Jones began her modelling career in New York state, then in Paris, working for fashion houses such as Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo, and appearing on the covers of Elle and Vogue. She worked with photographers such as Jean-Paul Goude, Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer, and became known for her distinctive androgynous appearance and bold features. Jones was signed by Island Records, who put her in the studio with disco record producer, Tom Moulton. Moulton worked at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, and Portfolio, was released in 1977. The album featured three songs from Broadway musicals, \\"Send in the Clowns\\" by Stephen Sondheim from A Little Night Music, \\"What I Did for Love\\" from A Chorus Line and \\"Tomorrow\\" from Annie. The second side of the album opens up with a seven-minute reinterpretation of Edith Piaf's \\"La Vie en rose\\" followed by three new recordings, two of which were co-written by Jones, \\"Sorry\\", and \\"That's the Trouble\\". The album finished with \\"I Need a Man\\", Jones' first club hit. The artwork to the album was designed by Richard Bernstein, an artist for Interview. In 1978, Jones and Moulton made Fame, an immediate follow-up to Portfolio, also recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. The album featured another reinterpretation of a French classic, \\"Autumn Leaves\\" by Jacques Prevert. The Canadian edition of the vinyl album included another French language track, \\"Comme un oiseau qui s'envole\\", which replaced \\"All on a Summers Night\\"; in most locations this song served as the B-side of the single \\"Do or Die\\". In the North American club scene, Fame was a hit album and the \\"Do or Die\\"/\\"Pride\\"/\\"Fame\\" side reached top 10 on both the US Hot Dance Club Play and Canadian Dance/Urban charts. The album was released on compact disc in the early 1990s, but soon went out of print. In 2011, it was released and remastered by Gold Legion, a record company that specialises in reissuing classic disco albums on CD. Jones' live shows were highly sexualized and flamboyant, leading her to be called \\"Queen of the Gay Discos.\\" Muse was the last of Jones' disco albums. The album features a re-recorded version \\"I'll Find My Way to You\\", which Jones released three years prior to Muse. Originally appearing in the 1976 Italian film, Colt 38 Special Squad in which Jones had a role as a club singer, Jones also recorded a song called \\"Again and Again\\" that was featured in the film. Both songs were produced by composer Stelvio Cipriani. Icelandic keyboardist Thor Baldursson arranged most of the album and also sang duet with Jones on the track \\"Suffer\\". Like the last two albums, the cover art is by Richard Bernstein. Like Fame, Muse was later released by Gold Legion.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: was it a single or an album?","completion":"It was an album.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the correct answer to the question \\"what do male dogs use in their urine to mark their territory?\\" is not \\"layers of fat.\\" Instead, as you have mentioned, male dogs use natural aphrodisiacs in their urine to mark their territory. These natural aphrodisiacs are, in fact, chemicals called pheromones. Pheromones are volatile, organic compounds secreted by animals, which are responsible for conveying information such as reproductive status, marking territory, and signaling alarm, among other functions. In the case of male dogs, they use pheromones to signal their presence and dominance to other dogs in the area. These pheromones are specifically found in a dog's urine and act as a chemical marker that they deposit onto the environment in order to communicate and assert their territory. Beyond territorial marking, pheromones also play a significant role in the social and reproductive lives of dogs. For example, female dogs emit certain pheromones during their reproductive cycles, which male dogs can sense and respond to accordingly. Similarly, male dogs can detect the pheromones released by other males or females in their environment to help them assess any potential threats or opportunities for mating. While layers of fat do not play a role in a male dog's ability to mark their territory with urine, fat has other essential functions for a dog's overall health and well-being. As an important component of their diet, fat provides energy, supports cell function, maintains the skin and coat, and aids in the absorption of essential vitamins. It is crucial to ensure that dogs have a well-balanced diet with appropriate levels of fat, as both excessive and insufficient fat intake can lead to health issues. In conclusion, male dogs use natural aphrodisiacs, specifically pheromones, in their urine to mark their territory instead of layers of fat. These pheromones are an essential means of communication for dogs, conveying information about territory, reproductive status, and social dynamics. Ensuring a well-balanced diet with appropriate levels of fat is still important for a dog's overall health and well-being, but it does not impact their ability to mark their territory using pheromones in their urine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: \\"What is the English translation of Madhavacharya's work?\\" Context: \\"Later Indian materialist Jayaraashi Bhatta (6th century) in his work Tattvopaplavasimha (\\"The upsetting of all principles\\") refuted the Nyaya Sutra epistemology. The materialistic Cārvāka philosophy appears to have died out some time after 1400. When Madhavacharya compiled Sarva-darśana-samgraha (a digest of all philosophies) in the 14th century, he had no Cārvāka/Lokāyata text to quote from, or even refer to.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The English translation of Madhavacharya's work, Sarva-darśana-samgraha, is \\"A Compendium of All Philosophies\\" or \\"A Digest of All Worldviews.\\" The work serves as a systematic overview and critique of the different philosophical schools in India during Madhavacharya's time. As an influential philosopher and celebrated Vedanta scholar of the 14th century, Madhavacharya aimed to provide an understanding of the various Indian philosophical systems in a single text. In Sarva-darśana-samgraha, Madhavacharya presents sixteen major Indian philosophical systems, including both orthodox and heterodox schools. The work examines views from prominent belief systems, such as: 1. Charvaka or Lokayata (Materialism) 2. Buddhism 3. Jainism 4. Nyaya (Indian logic) 5. Vaisheshika (Indian atomism) 6. Sankhya (Dualism) 7. Yoga (a sister system of Sankhya) 8. Mimamsa (ritual and hermeneutics) 9. Vedanta (end of the Vedas, specifically the Upanishads/Indian metaphysics) In the context provided, the materialistic Cārvāka philosophy seemed to have faded from prominence after the 14th century. Madhavacharya's compilation of Sarva-darśana-samgraha highlights that he could not find any original Carvaka or Lokayata texts to quote or reference while creating his digest of all philosophies. This fact underscores the decline of the materialistic Carvaka school in India. Despite the notable absence of original Carvaka texts, Madhavacharya's work is an invaluable resource for understanding the broad spectrum of Indian philosophical thought. The Sarva-darśana-samgraha not only offers a comprehensive overview of numerous philosophies but also compares and evaluates their fundamental principles and ideological assumptions. As a result, the text is an essential contribution to India's rich philosophical heritage and serves as a vital source of knowledge for scholars of Indian philosophy around the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Joe Lieberman is one of President Donald Trump's top picks to be nominated as FBI director, Trump said Thursday. Speaking to reporters while meeting with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Trump said he is \\"very close\\" to choosing a new FBI director to replace James Comey. And asked if Lieberman, the Democrat-turned-independent senator from Connecticut was a top candidate, Trump said yes. Trump met with Lieberman Wednesday and found him \\"agreeable,\\" a source said. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have been interviewing candidates to lead the bureau since Trump suddenly fired former Comey last week only a few years into what was created to be up to a 10-year term. The circumstances surrounding the firing have made the appointment closely watched, with senators calling for an unimpeachable, nonpartisan appointment. The firing drew instant criticism from both sides of the aisle, as Comey was overseeing the investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 US election and any possible links between the Trump camp and Russia during the campaign. While Trump's team initially claimed that the firing came after a review by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, laid out in a memo, that largely faulted Comey on his handling of the investigation into the private email server of Hillary Clinton, Trump later said in an interview he had already decided to fire Comey and cited the Russia investigation as being at the top of mind. After the firing, Rosenstein announced he would appoint a special counsel to oversee the investigation -- his decision because Sessions recused himself from it. Rosenstein only informed the White House of his decision to bring on former FBI Director Robert Mueller after the order was signed and less than an hour before it was announced publicly. The naming of the special counsel has appeased some Democrats, who were threatening to try to block any FBI director until such a move was made. But the appointment does not assuage all concerns, and an FBI director would still play a major role as things moved forward. Already one red-state Democrat, who would be a top target for Republicans to support a candidate, stated she would not be pleased with Lieberman as a pick. \\"It's a mistake to nominate anyone who's ever run for office,\\" Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill told reporters. \\"I'm somebody who spent a lot of time in law enforcement; this is a moment where we need a law enforcement professional that's never campaigned for a presidential candidate, never campaigned for office, never worn a party label to head the FBI.\\" Lieberman's long history in politics Lieberman was Democrat Al Gore's vice presidential nominee in 2000 and unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. But Lieberman, 75, is not necessarily popular with Democrats. He lost to a Senate primary challenger in 2006 and only retained his seat after he switched his party to independent. He also backed Republican Sen. John McCain's presidential bid in 2008 over Barack Obama, speaking at the Republican National Convention that year. Since leaving the Senate, Lieberman has been a senior counsel at the New York law firm Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman LLP and serves on a number of boards. Potentially complicating his issues with Democrats, Lieberman's firm has represented Trump in past litigation. Other candidates considered included current acting Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. and FBI Agent Frank Keating, career FBI official Richard McFeely and Texas Sen. John Cornyn and New York Judge Michael Garcia, who both withdrew their names. When Cornyn was under consideration, even his GOP colleagues questioned whether he would be the right choice as an elected official. Lieberman's closest law enforcement experience is serving as his state's attorney general, an elected position. FBI directors traditionally have had prosecutorial experience, either as an FBI agent or as a member of the Justice Department. Lieberman was born in Stamford, Connecticut, educated at Yale and Yale Law school, and served in the Connecticut state senate and as attorney general of the state before being elected as the state's Senator in Washington. First elected in 1988, Lieberman served as a Democrat until 2006, when he became an independent who caucused with the Democrats. He did not seek re-election in 2012. Lieberman is perhaps most famous for joining the ticket with Gore in his unsuccessful run for president in the 2000 election. Lieberman's selection as a vice presidential candidate was the first time a Jewish person was on a major party's presidential ticket. The former senator was known to buck his party even before endorsing McCain. Lieberman was the first Democratic senator to criticize former President Bill Clinton publicly during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Lieberman is a devout follower of Orthodox Judaism.

Some Senate Democrats hold a grudge against Lieberman for his rightward turn and opposition to some of President Barack Obama's agenda late in his Senate career. Others say even though they respect Lieberman, the job of FBI director should not go to a former politician. And all Democratic senators interviewed for this story said the former Connecticut senator lacks the kind of experience needed for the post. Story Continued Below The 2000 Democratic vice presidential candidate, who later caucused with the party as an independent in the Senate after losing his 2006 Senate primary, has emerged as a front-runner to replace fired FBI Director James Comey. But Lieberman's nomination likely would produce the most partisan vote for an FBI chief in Senate history. Typically, nominees for the job have been approved unanimously or with token opposition. “I don’t think there's going to be much excitement about that from our side of the aisle. Not because we don’t respect Joe Lieberman. But we need a law enforcement professional, not someone who’s run for office before,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). “We don’t need anyone who’s put on a red shirt or blue shirt — or who’s campaigned for president.” Lieberman ran for president in 2004. Republicans are lining up behind Lieberman, who left the Senate in 2013 after four terms. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) called him a \\"person of unquestioned integrity and that's what we need.\\" Added Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has spoken to Lieberman about the job: \\"If the president picked Joe Lieberman he’d be doing [the] country a good service and, I think, the FBI a good service.\\" But Republicans seem to be overstating Lieberman's Democratic support. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) predicted Lieberman would get 100 votes, a near impossibility. But Lieberman’s relationship with Democrats is damaged. After he left office, he urged senators in his own party to reject Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, infuriating Democrats. And his relationship with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Graham — the trio were known as the “three amigos” — tilted the Senate in a more hawkish direction during the first four years of Obama’s presidency. In 2008, Lieberman endorsed McCain over Obama for president. “He has a history of angering Democrats and Republicans, which is probably a good experience for being FBI director. But my concern is about someone with a political background. This is a moment for someone with a law enforcement background,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who holds Lieberman’s old seat. “It’s really important to restore people’s faith in the FBI.” Perhaps most surprising, Lieberman lacks support across the Democratic ideological spectrum. Moderates like McCaskill and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who are up for reelection in 2018 and could face difficult votes if Lieberman is indeed the nominee, are not lobbying for the former centrist Democratic senator. “Any other time, man, Joe is an excellent, excellent, choice,” Manchin said. Still, many liberals flat out don't like Lieberman. In an interview, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) fumed about Lieberman’s efforts to undercut more generous Medicare benefits in Obamacare and his relative closeness to Trump. After a monologue on Lieberman's faults, Brown ended by telling a reporter: “That’s all on the record.” “Joe Lieberman has no real law enforcement credentials. Look where he works now, a Trump law firm. That tells me a lot,” Brown said, referring to the law firm where Lieberman now works that represents Trump.

Lieberman also opposed a Democratic proposal to extend Medicare to people 55 and older, infuriating liberals. “He’s the reason we lost Medicare at 55 … Couldn’t have had anything to do with the insurance industry lobbying in Hartford. I’m sure Lieberman couldn’t succumb to that,” Brown said sarcastically. Trump said on Thursday that he’s “very close” on selecting a nominee. Republicans have the votes to confirm him if they stay united. But Lieberman is unlikely to garner a large bipartisan majority, which could fuel accusations that Republicans are politicizing the FBI. “We ought to stay away from political figures,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). “All the voting history, all the party history, whatever it is, I would stay away from it. Stick with the professionals.” Elana Schor contributed to this report. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Former Sen. Joe Lieberman is reported to be one of President Donald Trump's top picks to be nominated as FBI director, according to Trump. If nominated, Lieberman's appointment may face opposition from Democrats, as some hold grievances against him for his rightward turn and opposition to parts of President Obama's agenda. Others feel that an ex-politician should not be given the position of FBI director, which has traditionally been a nonpartisan role held by law enforcement professionals. Lieberman, who served as Al Gore's vice presidential nominee in 2000 and later switched to an independent party, is known for his long history in politics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We fans of Ed Wood tend to be an obsessive bunch in the first place, but this movie in particular has driven me to a level of fan-dom that I have never before approached! One of the most intense thrills of non-mainstream movie adulation - at least as far as I am concerned - is the pleasure of unearthing the obscure. I remember how, as a teenager, I longed to see Eddie's \\"Revenge of the Dead\\" (a.k.a. \\"Night of the Ghouls\\"), which at that time had been vaulted for a couple of decades. Likewise such arcane masterpieces of low budget filmmaking as Doris Wishman's \\"A Night to Dismember\\" or half the works of Jesus Franco! However, recent years have seen video and DVD rendering these once unfindable treasures almost TOO accessible - even for those of us on the 'wrong' (!) side of the Atlantic.... And then, behold, there was \\"I Woke Up Early the Day I Died\\" - a movie that SHOULD have been so 'big', yet which disappeared into the ether even before Fangoria printed the first fairly lengthy article on it that first whetted my appetite. The 1990s NEEDED a hard-to-find movie though which would REALLY be worth hunting out: and this, to be sure is it.... I don't especially wish to add too much of a commentary on all those marvellous aspects of the film - its classy-yet-kitsch cast, its haunting yet often hallucinogenic visuals, its wondrous moments of \\"pure cinema\\" (in the sense of the 1920s French cineastes) and surrealism, or even its resoundingly memorable soundtrack - since this has all been described most eloquently by other users here. What I DO wish to mention, briefly, is the pleasure that I have received also from hunting down certain obscure artefacts relating to this almost-lost-to-us-but-thankfully-not-quite movie! I think the German video, which I picked up while in Cologne on a cold crisp winter's day, is fairly well-known to Ed Wood's followers now. It is also quite common knowledge that a promotional poster for the film was released. However, there is thankfully more to be found!!! Firstly, there are a number of reviews available from the film's German THEATRICAL release - I have used several of these in my translation classes in an attempt to \\"Woodify\\" my students..... some of these reviews are positive eulogies to the film's artistry and entertainment value - and most interesting of all is that most critics placed it squarely within both the American trash AND European arthouse traditions. Secondly, there is the score by Larry Groupe', which can be acquired from the man himself - many of the tracks exert a truly emotional pull on the listener, particularly if you are contemplating the film's currently \\"vaulted\\" status and growing a little melancholy at the same time. Finally - for now - I wish to mention the promo SOUNDTRACK that Cinequanon put out in extremely limited numbers. BEG, BORROW, STEAL, KILL or do whatever it takes if you get the chance to acquire one of these!!!!!! It features 14 tracks from the film, including Eartha Kitt's ballad, the late Darcy Clay's \\"Jesus I Was Evil\\" (two versions of which are also available on CD from New Zealand, although that is another story again!), the cool radio music to which Christina Ricci dances, and also those amazing techno drops by Minty and ZHV (the latter being Billy Z's very own techno band).....

Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"Based on the content and tone of the review, it's clear that the user has a deep admiration for the movie \\"I Woke Up Early the Day I Died,\\" its creator Ed Wood, and associated relics from the film.

Monica hated the smell of hibiscus , while Victoria loved it, so OPTIONS: + Monica avoided walking through the garden.; + Victoria avoided walking through the garden.;","completion":"Monica hated the smell of hibiscus, while Victoria loved it, so Monica avoided walking through the garden. Victoria, on the other hand, would take every opportunity to stroll among the vibrant and fragrant hibiscus blooms. The beautiful flowers encircled the entire landscape, making it a stunning sight to behold. Victoria found the sweet aroma of the hibiscus both soothing and calming, basking in the tranquility it brought to her. As the brilliant shades of pinks, reds, and yellows entwined with the deep greens of their leaves, Victoria was drawn even more strongly to their beauty. When the sun would seep through the canopy of trees and shine a golden light on the colorful blooms, Victoria felt that the garden seemed as a gateway to a secret, enchanted paradise, and she could get lost in her thoughts for hours while she strolled amidst this rich, lush oasis. Conversely, the intense hibiscus fragrance would send Monica on a different path in order to evade the flowers. Despite the garden's aesthetic allure, Monica simply could not accept the smell of hibiscus. It would often trigger her allergies, causing her eyes to water, and nose to run. Instead, she preferred to walk along the nearby cobblestone roads or the meandering paths that lay beyond the hibiscus borders. The sisters had been at odds about the garden ever since their younger days, when their grandmother first introduced them to the hibiscus flowers. While one sister found solace and comfort among these natural treasures, the other saw them as an obstacle to peace and wellness. Over the years, this disagreement had only served to strengthen each sister's connection with the garden, albeit in very different ways. Nonetheless, they respected each other's preferences and never forced the other to adapt. When it came to family gatherings or leisurely strolls, they managed to find common ground in other ways. The sisters would often spend quality time in the park or take long walks along the beach, where the scents of the sea would envelop them, and their hearts would fill with shared joy. Victoria loved nothing more than capturing the hibiscus flowers through her art. With delicate strokes of the brush, she carefully painted the blossoms, immortalizing their grandeur in her work. The walls of her home were adorned with these lovingly crafted masterpieces. When Monica visited her sister, she couldn't help but admire the artwork, recognizing the talent and passion Victoria had put into these creations. Ultimately, the smell of hibiscus became a symbol of the sisters' individuality, each representing the unique interests, preferences, and bonds they held with the world around them. The garden remained a place where Victoria could connect with the essence of nature, while Monica found her solace in exploring the serene spaces beyond its flowering borders. Their differences, like the contrasting scent of the flowers, only served to enhance the beauty and richness of their sisterly bond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins.

Article: When we think about giving help to developing countries, we often think about giving money so that these countries can build schools and hospitals, buy food and medicine, or find clean water supplies. These seem to be the most important basic needs of the people we are trying to help. However, it's far from enough. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to come up with some better ideas to help them. I was very surprised, then, when I read about a plan to make cheap laptop computers for children in developing countries. A man called Nicholas Negroponte invented a cheap laptop computer, which can run without electricity. He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia. The laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed. These special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term. Another idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them.

Втората съдебна инстанция отмени определение на Окръжен съд от 15 март тази година, с което това искане е било оставено без уважение, съобщиха от апелативния съд. От края на ноември 2016 година Тонев е бил привлечен като обвиняем по досъдебно производство на ОД МВР Шумен за присвояване в особено големи размери. Разследването е установило, че по девет от изпълнителните дела той е присвоил от специалната сметка сумата от 256 907 лева, които ползвал за лични нужди. Според закона това е тежко умишлено престъпление, представляващо особено тежък случай, извършено в продължителен период от време и от длъжностно лице. Тонев е с мярка за неотклонение парична гаранция в размер с 5000 лева, определена от ОС-Шумен. Частният съдебен изпълнителвече е изтърпял наказание „отстраняване от длъжност за 1 година“, наложено му от Дисциплинарната комисия на Камарата на частните съдебни изпълнители. За този период от време архивът на Тонев е бил предаден на друг ЧСИ. Срокът на наказанието му е изтекъл на 12 януари 2017, а месец по-късно със заповед на министъра на правосъдието Асен Тонев е бил възстановен на длъжност ЧСИ. Предстоящо е и връщането на архива му. Междувременно в протеста на прокуратурата се сочи, че за друго допуснато от него нарушение Камарата на ЧСИ е насрочила за разглеждане ново дело. За да отстрани Тонев от длъжност ЧСИ, днес Апелативният съд във Варна е преценил, че той е обвинен за тежко умишлено престъпление, свързано със службата му. „Ако Асен Тонев приеме отново във владение архива на изпълнителните си дела, то този факт може да създаде реална опасност за обективното, всестранно и пълно изясняване на обстоятелствата по делото“, са се мотивирали още съдиите. Определението е окончателно и не подлежи на обжалване.

The apparent kidnapping of the 12 youths from an after-hours club called Heavens shocked residents of Mexico City, who for the most part have been spared from the violence seen in other areas. The lawyer, Ricardo Martinez, said his source told him there were 13 bodies found at the ranch, possibly in two mass graves, one that held the remains of the males, and the other, the females. Mexico City's attorney general on Thursday said there was one grave so far that was being investigated. Officials have not confirmed the identities of the bodies, and CNN could not independently confirm the claims of the attorney. Martinez said that a suspect in the disappearance of the youths led authorities to the ranch. Families of missing haunted by mystery. Mexico City Attorney General Rodolfo Rios said investigators were taking DNA samples to identify the remains, which could take several days. The site where the bodies are found is the town of Tlalmanalco, in the state of Mexico, about 30 miles east of Mexico City, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Local, state and federal police were all at the scene. A gang was involved in the mass disappearance, officials have said. The May 26 incident at the after-hours bar jolted the capital city, given it took place in daylight on a Sunday morning. Video footage shows a gang of about 17 people arriving in eight vehicles at the fashionable Zona Rosa district, according to authorities. The owner of the bar, a co-owner and two bar employees have been arrested in the case. CNNMexico's Veronica Diaz and Juan Pablo Mayorga contributed to this report.

It might help people learn what happened to 12 young people who were taken from a bar a while ago. At the grave, they found at least 7 bodies and made two arrests. Now, they are trying to find out if the bodies are of the missing young people. The people of Mexico City were really shocked about the missing kids from the bar called Heavens because they had not seen much violence like this before. The person who helps the families of the missing kids heard there might be 13 bodies and two different graves, one for boys and one for girls. To see if the bodies are of the missing young people, they are doing something called \\"DNA samples\\". This could take a few days.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Select from the following. a). not enough information b). they will have an increased risk of disease c). they will enjoy their food more d). they will be healthier than those who don't Q: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"b). they will have an increased risk of disease"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Now, I have a new situation: Russian research spent most of their time in Antarctica to study the loss of ozone in the atmosphere. The Canadian team went north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole to do the same thing. They spent several months there. The Canadian team didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole. Answer this question please: Which team didn't observe higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth? Answer:","completion":"The Canadian team did not observe higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth during their research expedition north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole. In the given situation, the Russian research team spent most of their time in Antarctica studying the loss of ozone in the atmosphere, where the ozone hole exists. On the other hand, the Canadian team went to the North Pole, where they did not find any ozone holes. Since the ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth, it can be concluded that the Russian team studying the ozone loss in Antarctica with the presence of the ozone hole would have observed higher levels of UV radiation. In contrast, the Canadian team, which did not find any ozone holes at the North Pole during their research, did not observe increased levels of UV radiation reaching Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"A: The first step of the process in muscle contraction is the generation of a neural signal, also known as a motor impulse, by the brain. This motor impulse is sent from the brain through the spinal cord and nerves to the specific muscle fibers that need to contract. In this step, the brain is essentially instructing the muscles to initiate contraction by communicating with motor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells responsible for controlling muscle movement. This neural signal is the initial trigger for the complex sequence of events that result in muscle contraction and the interaction of the filaments within the muscle fibers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - broad - loose - slack - windtight - crap The rationale to choose \\"loose\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"The rationale to choose \\"loose\\" as the answer to the question, \\"Sarah told him to make sure that the bundle was tight. Some fell out because it was what?\\" is based on the understanding of the context, the meaning of the words provided as choices, and the logical relationship between the words and the situation described. A: Context Understanding In this situation, Sarah instructed someone to make sure the bundle was tight. This implies that Sarah wanted the bundle to be secure, with its contents held firmly together. The fact that some items fell out indicates the bundle was not adequately tied, hinting at a possible lack of tightness or looseness. B: Meaning and Relevance of Each Choice 1. Broad - This word describes something wide or extensive in extent or scope. It is not related to the tightness of the bundle and thus not the cause of the items falling out. 2. Loose - This word is the opposite of tight, referring to something that is not securely fastened or held together. This directly relates to the issue of the bundle that Sarah wanted to avoid. 3. Slack - This word can have a similar meaning to loose. However, slack implies a lack of tautness or tension rather than a lack of secure fastening. Slack is less appropriate in this context, but it still has some relevance. 4. Windtight - This term refers to something being impervious to air or drafts. It does not relate to the tightness of a bundle or items falling out. 5. Crap - This word is informal slang used to describe something of poor quality, rubbish or nonsense. It does not directly pertain to the tightness of the bundle or the falling out of its contents. C: Logical Relationship Between Choices and the Situation After analyzing the context and the meanings of the given choices, \\"loose\\" emerges as the most logical answer in this situation. The other options do not directly address the tightness of the bundle or the falling out of its contents. Since Sarah explicitly instructed someone to make sure the bundle was tight, the issue of items falling out is most likely due to the bundle being loose. In conclusion, the rationale to choose \\"loose\\" as the answer to this question is based on the understanding of the context, meaning of each word provided as a choice, and the logical relationship between the choices and the situation described. The word \\"loose\\" is the most appropriate choice because it directly relates to the lack of tightness that led to the items falling out of the bundle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A wildcard mask is like the opposite of a subnet mask. It helps us find out what houses don't have this /23 rule. It's like knowing which houses don't have the same color. So, to find the wildcard mask, we need to do some simple counting. Remember, there are 32 streets total, but we only have 23 with the /23 rule. So, we're missing 32 - 23 = 9 streets. Now, we can figure out how many houses don't have the rule by using the magic number 2. The magic works this way: we multiply 2 by itself 9 times, so 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 512. But we need to be careful! We should subtract one from 512 to get the final answer. So, 512 - 1 = 511. The wildcard mask equivalent of the subnet mask /23 is 0.0.1.255. Isn't that a nice little story? The wildcard mask helps us know which houses don't follow the same rule, and now we know how to find it!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Robert Altman shouldn't make a movie like this, but the fact that he did- and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightly-wound thriller in that paperback-tradition of Grisham thrillers- shows a versatility that is commendable. In the Gingerbread Man he actually has to work with something that, unfortunately, he isn't always very successful at, or at least it's not the first thing on his checklist as director: plot. There's one of those big, juicy almost pot-boiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate low-class woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways, twists and plot ensues, yada yada. And it's surprising that Altman would really want to take on one of these \\"I saw that coming from back there!\\" endings, or just a such a semi-conventional thriller. But it's a surprise that pays off because, oddly enough, Altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior, or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very well-cast ensemble, of a small-town Georgian environment. The film drips with atmosphere (if not total superlative craftsmanship, sometimes it's good and sometimes just decent for Altman), as Savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and marshes and rain keep things soaked and muggy and humid. So the atmosphere is really potent, but so are performances from (sometimes) hysterical Kenneth Branaugh, Embeth Davitz as the 'woman' who lawyer Branaugh gets caught up with, and Robert Downey Jr (when is he *not* good?) as the private detective in Branaugh's employ. Did I neglect Robert Duvall, who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the bad-vibes of the picture on? As said, some of the plot is a little weak, or just kind of standard (lawyer is divorced, bitter custody battle looms, innocent and goofy kids), but at the same time I think Altman saw something captivating in the material, something darker than some of the other Grisham works that has this standing out somehow. If it's not entirely masterful, it still works on its limited terms as a what-will-happen-next mystery-Southern-noir. Now, what is this review like? Possible answers: [i] negative. [ii] positive.","completion":"This review can be considered as [ii] positive. The reviewer appreciates the versatility of Robert Altman in creating a reasonably good and tightly-wound thriller.

Answer the following question: Information: - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Loch Tay (Scottish Gaelic, \\"Loch Tatha\\") is a freshwater loch in the central highlands of Scotland, in the Perth and Kinross and Stirling council areas. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Northern Isles is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century. - In common law systems, land tenure is the legal regime in which land is owned by an individual, who is said to \\"hold\\" the land. The French verb \\"tenir\\" means \\"to hold\\" and \\"tenant\\" is the present participle of \\"tenir\\". The sovereign monarch, known as The Crown, held land in its own right. All private owners are either its tenants or sub-tenants. \\"Tenure\\" signifies the relationship between tenant and lord, not the relationship between tenant and land. - Crofting is a form of land tenure and small-scale food production particular to the Scottish Highlands, the islands of Scotland, and formerly on the Isle of Man. Within the 19th century townships, individual crofts are established on the better land, and a large area of poorer-quality hill ground is shared by all the crofters of the township for grazing of their livestock. - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times. - Perth and Kinross is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland and a Lieutenancy Area. It borders onto the Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Fife, Highland and Stirling council areas. Perth is the administrative centre. The council boundaries correspond broadly, but not exactly, with the former counties of Perthshire and Kinross-shire. - Fearnan ( Gaelic Feàrnan , ' Alders ' ) is a small crofting village on the north shore of Loch Tay in Perthshire , Scotland . The village lies at the junction of the road to Glen Lyon and the road between Kenmore and Killin that runs along the north side of the loch . The land around the village has at various times in history belonged to both the Robertsons of Struan and the Campbells . The village is now a mix of old crofts dating back up to 400 years and new builds mainly from the 1980s . There is also a whole hidden village of crofts with just their foundations left , just below the forestry of Drummond Hill . Visitors who wish to explore the area are encouraged to park at the village hall and walk up the field opposite , clamber over the wall and walk right , where there is a road covered in fern , then walk up the hill , and with a bit of searching they will find the remnants of the houses . The village 's only hotel , the Tigh - an - Loan , went out of business in 2008 and the building was demolished a year later . Up to the early 1970s , this loch - side hotel also ran a small garage / filling station plus the village post office . The latter moved to a new building just east of the junction for Fortingall but even that closed in 2001 and now the nearest shops are in Kenmore , 3.5 miles away . Along with several other village schools around Loch Tay , the one class village primary school ( where Kate Maynard was the last teacher ) closed in 1983 when a new comprehensive primary school opened in the grounds of Taymouth Castle in Kenmore . Secondary school pupils have always had to travel to Aberfeldy ( 10 miles from Fearnan ) and that situation continues today . Across the road from the former school building lies the remains of Fearnan Pier , one of five intermediate piers served until 1946 by the Caledonian ( later LMS ) Railway 's steamers plying from Killin to Kenmore and back . At the top of the road leading up from the lochside , 20 metres past Quarry Road ( a single lane road accessing the top... - Perthshire, officially the County of Perth, is a registration county in central Scotland.

It has five well-defined ridges radiating out from the summit. Four corries lie between the ridges; including Coire Gaothaich which lies on the northeast side of the mountain. - The Pass of Drumochter is the main mountain pass between the northern and southern central Scottish Highlands. The A9 road passes through here, as does the Highland Main Line, the railway between Inverness and the south of Scotland. The Sustrans National Cycle Route 7 between Glasgow and Inverness also runs through the pass. - Rannoch Moor (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Mòinteach Raineach/Raithneach\\") is an expanse of around 50 square miles (130 km²) of boggy moorland to the west of Loch Rannoch in Scotland, where it extends from and into westerly Perth and Kinross, northerly Lochaber (in Highland), and the area of Highland Scotland toward its south-west, northern Argyll and Bute. Rannoch Moor is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation. - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - The Highlands (\\"the place of the Gaels\\") are a historic region of Scotland. The region became culturally distinguishable from the Lowlands from the later Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands. The Scottish Gaelic name of \\"A' Ghàidhealtachd\\" literally means \\"the place of the Gaels\\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands. - Loch is the Irish and Scottish Gaelic word for a lake or for a sea inlet. It is cognate with the Manx lough, Cornish logh, and the Welsh word for lake, llyn. - Scottish Gaelic or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to as Gaelic (\\" ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - A registration county was, in Great Britain and Ireland, a statistical unit used for the registration of births, deaths and marriages and for the output of census information.

Title: Dissapointed Review: I brought this book based on several recommendations. I admit that I didn't read much of it before I gave up - only the first 30 pages - so perhaps I am not the most reliable of reviewers, but this book was so much of a letdown for me that I could not stomach another word (or mention of the dreaded \\"cinammon rolls\\").My issue with it was that the narrative felt rambling and disorganized. In a scene where the main character has her first meeting with the vampires, the narrative gets so wrapped up in her talking about the past that I could barely follow what was going on. At a pivotal scene such as this, I expected much better writing. Since the author failed to deliver, I felt it not worth my time or effort to keep on reading. Getting even this far in the book was a struggle and a chore for me. I was bored and did not feel any interest for the main character and her obsession with baking. The other characters felt like filler, and the world as a whole was difficult to visualize. Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, the product review is negative.

The two questions, \\"How do girls feel when they are squirting?\\" and \\"How does it feel for a woman to squirt?\\" are indeed the same. They aim to understand the sensations and emotions experienced by a female during the act of squirting. Both questions inquire about the feelings, and while the phrasing is slightly different, they essentially explore the same topic. Squirting, also known as female ejaculation, is a phenomenon involving the release of fluid from a woman's urethra at the time of sexual arousal or orgasm. While it is a subject of debate among researchers and scientists, many women have reported experiencing squirting, and various explanations attribute it to the Skene's glands, the G-spot, or the bladder. The sensations and emotions a woman might feel during squirting can vary greatly from individual to individual. Some women might experience a heightened sense of pleasure and arousal, whereas others could feel discomfort or even embarrassment. Physically, a woman may feel a rapid, intense release of pressure, accompanied by muscle contractions in the pelvic area. This feeling is often followed by a sense of relaxation or satisfaction. Emotionally, the experience could be thrilling, liberating, empowering, or simply a new sensation for the individual. It is important to note that women's experiences with squirting will differ due to various factors such as personal preferences, comfort levels, past sexual experiences, and physiological factors, among others. Communication and understanding between partners play a significant role in supporting a woman's experience of squirting. In conclusion, both questions essentially ask the same thing and aim to understand the experience of women during the act of squirting. Due to the complexities of the female body and individual differences, the sensations and emotions felt by a woman during the act can differ, making it essential to foster healthy communication and exploration in the realm of sexual experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the following context: Following the termination of their contract with RCA, the Kinks signed with Arista Records in 1976. With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \\"Father Christmas\\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist Ian Gibbons was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group. Despite the personnel changes, the popularity of the band's records and live shows continued to grow. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands such as the Jam (\\"David Watts\\"), the Pretenders (\\"Stop Your Sobbing\\", \\"I Go to Sleep\\") and the Knack (\\"The Hard Way\\") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases.

Which process will separate the sugar from a mixture of sugar and water? Pick the answer from these options","completion":"Although you didn't provide any specific options to choose from, I can provide you with a detailed explanation of a process that can separate sugar from a mixture of sugar and water. The most common and effective process to achieve this is evaporation. Evaporation is a process in which a liquid is transformed into a gas or vapor, leaving behind any dissolved solids or solutes that were part of the liquid state. When it comes to a sugar and water mixture, evaporation can be used to separate the sugar (a solute) from the water (a solvent). Here's a step-by-step guide to separate sugar from a sugar-water mixture using evaporation: 1. Find a heat source: In order to speed up the process of evaporation, a heat source is required. This can be a stove, an oven, or even direct sunlight. However, be cautious not to use excessive heat as it may cause caramelization of the sugar. 2. Choose an appropriate container: Select a heat-resistant, shallow container with a large surface area to expose more of the sugar-water mixture to the heat. This will help speed up the evaporation process. A glass or ceramic container is suitable for this purpose. 3. Pour the sugar-water mixture into the container: Gently pour the sugar-water mixture into the container, ensuring that it's evenly distributed. Maintaining a thin layer of the mixture will assist in speeding up the evaporation process. 4. Place the container on your heat source: Place the container on the heat source and monitor the temperature closely. Remember, too much heat can damage the sugar. Maintain a temperature of around 60 - 90 degrees Celsius (140 - 194 degrees Fahrenheit). 5. Observe the evaporation process: As the water evaporates, the sugar will be left behind. You will notice that the water level decreases and a layer of sugar starts to form on the surface. 6. Collect the sugar: Once all the water has evaporated, and you're left with only sugar, carefully collect it from the container using a spatula or similar tool. Leave the sugar to cool down before transferring it to a storage container or using it for your intended purpose. Using the evaporation process, you can successfully separate sugar from the liquid portion of the sugar-water mixture. Keep in mind that this method might take time, depending on the heat source and the size of the container. By following these steps, you should be able to effectively separate sugar from a sugar-water mixture."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to \\"see\\" more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by George Sperling (1963) using the \\"partial report paradigm\\". Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments,Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the \\"whole report\\" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.

Syrian tripped by Hungarian camerawoman gets job offer at Spanish soccer coaching school The video footage sparked international outrage: A desperate Syrian father, clutching his small son, runs with hundreds fleeing from authorities at an Hungarian camp. Then, a Hungarian camerawoman sticks her leg out and trips him. He tumbles. He screams. Although he was just one of thousands fleeing war-torn Syria, the incident set off a wave of media coverage, and soon he wasn't a nameless refugee. He is Osama Abdul Mohsen, father to 7-year-old Zaid, and he once coached division one soccer in Syria. [At choke points on the way to Western Europe, chaos and growing frustration] Now, Spain's national soccer coach training center, Cenafe, has arranged for him to come to the country, where a job offer and a place to live near Getafe await him, the Associated Press reported. \\"Hopefully, this will serve as an example to the rest of Europe,” school director Miguel Galán said, according to AP. “We need to help these people.” A Hungarian camerawoman with the country's N1 TV station is seen tripping a man holding a child. The scene was captured at the Roeszke camp as refugees tried to escape from the police. The woman has since been fired. (Stephan Richter/Twitter) Mohsen arrived in Madrid on Thursday after traveling by train from Germany with two of his sons, an Arabic-speaking Cenafe student and a reporter from the Spanish newspaper El Mundo. \\"I am very, very happy when Mr. Miguel called [me] to come to Spain,\\" Mohsen said on the train in an video interview with El Mundo. \\"I see a future for my family in Spain.\\" [Five ways to solve Europe’s refugee crisis] Mohsen's wife and two other children remain in Turkey, and he said on camera that it's \\"very vital\\" that his family reunite with him in Spain. Authorities at the soccer academy are working to have Mohsen's family join him and to get him legalized so he can work there, AP reported. The migrant crisis in Europe reached a new apex this week when Hungary erected 109 miles of razor-wire fencing along its border, hoping to keep out people seeking to make it farther inland to wealthier nations such as Germany. Last month, a record 156,000 migrants entered Europe, according to the E.U. border agency Frontex. Spain pledged last week to welcome 17,680 refugees. After footage showing her tripping Mohsen went viral, Hungarian camerawoman Petra Laszlo was fired from N1TV, considered a right-wing station. She subsequently apologized. [‘Something snapped in me': Hungarian camerawoman apologizes for tripping refugees] Cenafe's director told El Pais that it used its advertising budget to pay for an apartment for Mohsen. \\"When we saw the story of Mohsen published in the newspapers we felt very bad about it,” Galán told the newspaper. “As soon as he learns Spanish, we plan to offer him a job at our organization.” In a statement, the soccer academy said that many of its students go on to work internationally and that the addition of Mohsen will help to better prepare them for foreign work. \\"We can only thank Osama for accepting our invitation,\\" the statement read.

Article: Nancy Tillman's wonderful On the Night You Were Born is one of my very favorite books. Its celebration of the uniqueness of each and every child told in lyrical language makes it the gift I choose most often for expectant or adoptive parents. I also read it regularly with my grandchildren and talk with them about how special they are. Tillman feels that the most important message for children to receive is simply, \\"You are loved.\\" And it's that message that is the focus of this, her newest book, Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You. Once again, it is her turn of phrase that most fascinates me: In the green of the grass ... in the smell of the sea ... in the clouds floating by ... at the top of a tree ... in the sound crickets make at the end of the day ... \\"You are loved. You are loved. You are loved,\\" they all say. Phrases encourage children to grow, to try new things, to \\"march to the front\\" of their \\"own parade\\" and assures them that, no matter how far they go or what they do, they will be loved. Though the words alone would convince me to buy, share and recommend this book, Tillman is also a gifted artist and her lovely work makes this book a visual treasure as well. Through the pages, a child rides hippos, splashes in the surf with elephants, plays hide and seek with rabbits, shares a trampoline with a kangaroo and enjoys some quiet time with a pair of pandas. My favorite drawing has the child walking away along a wide path that runs between trees covered in mist. In all of the drawings, swirls of sparkling lights wrap around the child--the love that will always be with him/her. I've read On the Night You Were Born dozens of times and with every single reading, I am incredibly touched. Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You creates the same feeling of wonder, peace and happiness in me. It's a keep-forever book and I'm so happy to have it in my collection to share with the children I love most. Question: The purpose of this passage is to _ .

Now the meteor Orpheus, which is five miles wide, is on a collision course with Earth. While the United States government and military engage in political maneuvering, other smaller and faster moving fragments rain down on Earth. The major plot point involves secret orbiting nuclear missile platforms, one put up by Dr. Bradley's (Connery) team for the U.S., named Hercules and another constructed by his counterpart in the Soviet Union, nicknamed Peter the Great by Dubov. The American president (Fonda) is advised by military leaders against admitting the existence of Hercules, at the same time the Soviets are reluctant to admit to the existence of its orbital weapons.The President goes on national television and reveals the existence of Hercules, explaining it as a foresighted project to meet the threat that Orpheus represents. He also offers the Soviets a chance to save face and join in by saying they had the same foresight and have their own. Bradley requested a scientist named Dr. Alexei Dubov (Keith) to help him plan a countereffort against Orpheus.Bradley and Sherwood have already arrived at the control center for Hercules, which is located beneath the Sony Building (then called the AT&T; Building) in downtown New York. Major-General Adlon (Landau) is the commander of the facility.

Question: What character does the guard think mistake for a Prince? Movie title: The Prince and the Pauper Movie plot: In Tudor England, two boys are born on the same day in the most different circumstances imaginable. Tom (Billy Mauch) is the son of vicious criminal John Canty (Barton MacLane), while Edward VI (Bobby Mauch) is a prince and the heir of King Henry VIII of England (Montagu Love). One grows up in poverty, hungering for something better for himself and his family, the other in isolated luxury, with a strong curiosity about the outside world. When they are youngsters, they meet and are astounded by their striking resemblance to each other. As a prank, they exchange clothes, but the Captain of the Guard (Alan Hale, Sr.) mistakes the prince for the pauper and throws him out of the palace grounds. Tom is unable to convince anybody except for the Earl of Hertford (Claude Rains) of his identity. Everyone else is convinced that he is mentally ill. When Henry VIII dies, Hertford threatens to expose Tom unless he does as he is told. Hertford also blackmails the Captain into searching for the real prince to eliminate the dangerous loose end. Meanwhile, Edward finds an amused, if disbelieving protector in Miles Hendon (Errol Flynn). An attempt to assassinate the boy on the instigation of the Earl of Hertford, who fears for his power if the real king lives, changes Hendon's opinion of Edward's story. With Hendon's help, Edward manages to re-enter the palace just in time to interrupt the coronation ceremony and prove his identity. Tom is made a ward of the new king, Hertford is banished for life, and Hendon is rewarded for his services.","completion":"In the movie \\"The Prince and the Pauper,\\" the Captain of the Guard mistakes the prince, Edward VI, for the pauper, Tom, when the boys exchange clothes as a prank."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: This article: Sir Henry Joseph Wood (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms. He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music, in addition to conducting concerts and festivals throughout the country, as well as The Proms?, what is it ?

'Stitched up': Nawal Msaad, 27, from north London, claims she did not know where the money came from when she agreed to carry €20,000 to Istanbul. A young British student accused of smuggling cash in her knickers to fund jihadists fighting in Syria today said she had been 'stitched up' by her friend. Nawal Msaad, 27, was caught with the stash of €20,000, the equivalent of £15,830, in rolled up notes as she prepared to board a flight to Istanbul from Heathrow, jurors have heard. The Old Bailey was earlier told she agreed to be a 'trusted courier' for her close friend Amal El Wahabi, also 27. The money was to be taken to Turkey at the request of El Wahabi’s husband Aine Davis, who was known as Hamza and had joined fighters in war-torn Syria, the court heard. But she was stopped by police after the cash - which had been hidden inside her in a condom - fell out into her pants. Taking to the witness box at the Old Bailey in tight light pink trousers, a white sleeveless shirt and pink strappy high heel shoes, Msaad insisted she had never meant to smuggle cash abroad to bankroll terrorism. And she accused her friend and co-defendant El Wahabi of 'stitching' her up by not telling her where the money had come from. Her defence barrister Naeem Mian asked her: 'It was put to you that in effect you have been stitched up by her, what do you say to that?' Msaad said: 'Well, she wasn’t completely honest with me about where the money came from. And so I do get that feeling, I’m not going to deny that - the feeling that I have been stitched up.' Msaad, of Holloway, north London, and El Wahabi, of north west London, both deny funding terrorism. Msaad, who was born and raised in London and studying human resource management at London Metropolitan University in Aldgate, said she has known her friend since their school days at Holland Park School. She admitted having a 'soft spot' for her friend, but said they are not very close. And she vehemently denied ever trying to smuggle cash to extremists fighting in Syria, which is in the midst of a bloody civil war. Speaking so softly that the judge had to repeatedly ask her to keep her voice up, she flatly denied the charge against her. Mr Mian asked her: 'Between 13 and 16 of January 2014 were you concerned in an arrangement to make money available for the purposes of terrorism?' She replied: 'No'. He added: 'Did you suspect that the €20,000 given to you by El Wahabi may have been for the purposes of terrorism?' She again replied: 'No'. Her barrister said: 'Were you ever told or did you ever suspect that Aine Davis, otherwise known as Hamza, was or may be involved in terrorism.' She replied: 'No' and also said she had no idea the cash might have come from drug dealing and crime. She added: 'I had no intention to smuggle money into Turkey.' On January 16 this year Msaad set off for Heathrow airport for the three-day trip but when she approached the departure gate she was stopped by police. She said she was going for a 'short break', was buying gold for her mother and had €20,000 'around me'. She was later arrested. Davis allegedly left London in July last year to pursue the jihadist cause but had maintained regular contact with his wife, with whom he has two young sons. The 30-year-old, who was also born in London with roots in Gambia, converted to Islam six or seven years ago, it is alleged. Accusation: Msaad (left) claims she thought the €20,000 was for her school friend and co-defendant Amal El Wahabi (right) to start a new life abroad with her husband and children. Msaad was arrested at Heathrow. Msaad said El Wahabi originally said she had a job for her and that she would be paid €1,000 if she did it. She told jurors she was 'curious' and originally thought it might be a hairdressing job. El Wahabi texted her friend and said 'I asked you because I trust you' but later said she 'can’t explain' the job by phone, the court heard. But El Wahabi later told her it was to courier around €10,000 (£7,900) or 'maybe more' to her husband who she was going to travel abroad to live with, along with their two children. Msaad said she believed the cash was for a new house as the family were setting up home abroad. She later had a phone call with Davis on January 13 who asked her to bring €20,000 (£15,800) over. Msaad told the court: 'I asked \\"how much?\\" He said 20 bags - a bag is €1,000 in slang.' Asked if she had any concerns about travelling with such a large amount of cash on her, she said: 'It is a lot of money, it’s a big responsibility. 'I just didn’t want to lose their money. I was a bit worried.' But she insisted she didn’t think she was doing anything illegal. Denial: Msaad spoke at the Old Bailey to deny funding terrorism and said she has never held extremist views. She said: 'I asked him \\"Are you allowed to bring that amount of money over?\\" 'The way he sounded was really reassuring. He said \\"It’s fine, you can bring that amount of money\\", I had no reason to doubt him.' She admitted she had never asked where the cash came from, but thought it to be Davis’ savings. Msaad, whose family come from Morocco, said she is a Muslim who prays and fasts on Ramadan, but 'wouldn't say my family is particularly religious. I wouldn't call myself religious'. And she denied that she was very political or had ever viewed extremist, jihadi literature. She told the court: 'I would say I'm not more or less than the average person is interested in politics. 'However, I'm sensitive to the situations that are going on in the world, I don't turn a blind eye to anything. 'I'm sympathetic towards situations, but I don't dedicate any of my time towards politics.' The trial was adjourned until 9.30am tomorrow morning.

Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. Paragraph: John was studying the species in African Savannah. He noticed that elands, which is a prey animal, are basically nocturnal. On the other hand, wild boars, another prey animal, are not nocturnal.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I just saw this film yesterday. My girlfriend wanted to see it only because of Richard Gere. I feel I wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend it's the last time we go to see a film just because a certain actor/actress is in it. I hope she learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in her seat. As of me, since I paid already, I wanted to see the end at least, just in the hope something good would turn up, but I didn't hold my breath, and luckily so cause I would have been a victim of the film just the same. This is not a black and white film, it's a black and black one. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all sex offenders are portrayed as unredeemable hard core criminals and the bad ones among them were really very very bad. Speak of a cliché and the exploitation of a typical US phobia. Richard Gere's acting was good as usual but the blond girl that's supposed to replace him was wishy washy at best. Totally unconvincing for the job. The film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic, and sensational turn that just is unreal. They just use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murders, vigilante beating, rape and torture - something that almost seems gratuitous. They even have a wolf attacking people in the film - how low can you get. I gather the film won't come out in the USA and will go straight to DVD. That's were it should have stayed in other countries too, but because it's Hollywood and Richard Gere they just had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the film is not even worth a B-series movie.

Answer the following question: Two climate experts studied different continent to observe climate changes. Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica. Which person observed a strong warming on the Antarctic Peninsula? Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

She easily won the piano trophy; in the singing finals she sang Roger Quilter's To Daisies, a performance which earned her the festival's top vocal award. To mark her double triumph in piano and voice, Ferrier was awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival.After her Carlisle victories, Ferrier began to receive offers of singing engagements. Her first appearance as a professional vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria. She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang Ma Curly-Headed Babby in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcast—her first as a vocalist—attracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed by the death of her mother at the beginning of February. At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss's song All Souls' Day, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music teacher with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar.When Albert Wilson joined the army in 1940, Ferrier reverted to her maiden name, having until then sung as 'Kathleen Wilson'. In December 1940 she appeared for the first time professionally as 'Kathleen Ferrier' in a performance of Handel's Messiah, under Hutchinson's direction.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"If there is an abundance of food available for the caterpillars to consume, it can have several effects on the subsequent cocoon formation and hatching process, which can be classified as both direct and indirect impacts on the life cycle of a butterfly. Direct Impact: 1. Increased Growth Rate: With access to plenty of food, caterpillars will have a higher chance of growing faster and larger, as they can feed constantly without any limitations. This increased growth rate will allow them to reach the cocoon formation stage more quickly, increasing the overall number of cocoons over a given time period. 2. Improved Health and Survival Rates: Ample food sources will provide caterpillars with the essential nutrients they require to maintain good health and develop properly. This will directly impact their survival rates, ensuring that more caterpillars can successfully form cocoons and transform into pupae. Indirect Impact: 1. Enhanced Cocoon Formation: If caterpillars are properly nourished, their overall health will be improved, allowing them to create more robust and well-constructed cocoons. This, in turn, can have an indirect impact on the hatching process, as stronger and healthier pupae will be better equipped to emerge as butterflies. 2. Increased Butterfly Population: If more cocoons hatch due to increased food availability for caterpillars, the overall butterfly population will experience a boost. This can indirectly affect their reproductive success, with a more significant number of butterflies being able to mate and lay eggs, further perpetuating the cycle. 3. Changes in Ecosystem Dynamics: An increase in the butterfly population as a result of more cocoons hatching can have indirect effects on the local ecosystem, promoting changes in resource availability and predator-prey dynamics. This could lead to further impacts on the life cycle of the butterflies and other species within the ecosystem. In summary, the availability of ample food for caterpillars can influence the cocoon formation and hatching process through both direct and indirect impacts. Directly, it helps caterpillars grow faster and healthier, while indirectly, it can lead to more robust cocoons, increase the butterfly population, and impact the overall ecosystem dynamics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: (CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

Question: Information: - Ten Foot Pole is an American punk rock band, formerly on Epitaph Records. - Rev is the second album by Ten Foot Pole , and the last to feature Scott Radinsky . - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Epitaph Records is a Hollywood-based independent record label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. The label was originally \\"just a logo and a P.O. box\\" created in the 1980s for the purpose of selling Bad Religion records, but has evolved into a large independent record label. Gurewitz took the name from a King Crimson song of the same name. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most of the bands on Epitaph were punk and pop punk groups, while there are many post-hardcore and bands signed to the label as well. A large portion of the record label, known as Hellcat Records, is owned by Tim Armstrong, frontman of the punk rock band Rancid. Several sister-labels also exist, such as ANTI-, Burning Heart Records, Fat Possum Records, Hellcat Records and Heart & Skull Records that have signed other types of bands. - Scott David Radinsky (born March 3, 1968) is a left-handed former relief pitcher in Major League Baseball, who had an 11-year career from and .

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that George Grove helped? In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils.

There's no \\" right place \\" to put it, since the object is unpredictability, as with a knuckleball. Possible answers: (A). Yes; (B). It's impossible to say; (C). No; Hypothesis: A spitball is compared to a knuckleball.","completion":"The hypothesis mentioned is indeed correct, so the answer would be (A). Yes. According to the paragraph provided, a spitball is compared to a knuckleball. Both the spitball and knuckleball are termed unpredictable in the context of how they move, making them difficult for the batter to hit in a game of baseball. This unpredictability is achieved by altering the ball's uniform weight and resistance. In both cases, the alteration is achieved by the pitcher, either through the application of saliva or vaseline (in the case of a spitball) or by holding and releasing the ball in a specific manner (in the case of a knuckleball). The saliva, vaseline, or the specific grip impact the ball’s aerodynamics, causing it to move in an unpredictable trajectory that is difficult for the batter to anticipate. Thus, the paragraph does indeed compare a spitball to a knuckleball in this way. Thus, the essence of this comparison is the notion of unpredictability in the behavior of the ball, aimed to disorient the batter and increase the chances of the pitcher successfully striking the batter out. This makes it evident that manipulation of the ball, whether through foreign substances or unique grips, becomes a skillful tactic employed by the pitcher in baseball, making the game all the more strategic and unpredictable. Nevertheless, it's also worth mentioning that while both balls are used to add uncertainty to the game, the way they are thrown and the behavior they exhibit is different. For instance, the knuckleball is often less fast but more unpredictable in its trajectory due to the minimal spin when thrown, while a spitball can be more slippery and fast due to the lubricating action of the saliva or vaseline. However, in both cases, the end goal is the same—making the ball difficult for the batter to hit by promoting unpredictability in its trajectory, as the provided paragraph discusses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues. They go to Andrei's house where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is revealed to be Anatoly Grishin.

Question 1: Why acceleration due to gravity is zero at center? Question 2: Is acceleration due to gravity an absolute constant? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Why acceleration due to gravity is zero at the center? Step 1: Understand the concept of gravitational force Gravitational force is the attractive force between two objects with mass. The magnitude of the force is proportional to the product of the masses of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Step 2: Apply the concept to objects inside a massive spherical body When a small object is inside a massive spherical body (e.g., planet or star), the gravitational force acting on the object is the vector sum of the forces exerted by all parts of the massive body. Step 3: Compute the net force at the center At the center of the spherical body, the gravitational forces exerted by all parts of the body effectively cancel one another out, as they are equal in magnitude and acting in opposite directions (due to symmetry). Step 4: Relate gravitational force and acceleration due to gravity Newton's second law states that the net force acting on an object (F) is equal to the mass of the object (m) multiplied by its acceleration (a), or F = ma. Acceleration due to gravity (g) is the acceleration experienced by an object due to the gravitational force acting upon it. Step 5: Conclude Since the net gravitational force at the center of the spherical body is zero, the acceleration due to gravity (g) is also zero at the center. Question 2: Is acceleration due to gravity an absolute constant? Step 1: Recognize that acceleration due to gravity varies with location Acceleration due to gravity is not an absolute constant because it depends on the distance from the center of the massive body and its mass distribution. Step 2: Establish factors that cause variation in acceleration due to gravity Acceleration due to gravity varies due to several factors such as altitude, latitude, and the irregular shape of a massive body (e.g., Earth). Generally, the acceleration due to gravity increases as you move towards the poles and decreases as you move towards the equator. Step 3: Conclude Acceleration due to gravity is not an absolute constant, as it varies depending on location and other factors. Conclusion: Although both questions are related to the acceleration due to gravity, they are not asking the same thing. Question 1 asks why the acceleration due to gravity is zero at the center of a massive body, while Question 2 asks if acceleration due to gravity is an absolute constant. We have demonstrated that the two concepts are distinct."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

(I) begin to perform faster the slower they drum: This option is confusing and contradictory, as it states that the performers play faster and slower at the same time. It does not add a clear or coherent continuation to the paragraph. (II) begin going round in a circle as they play the instruments: This option is plausible, as it describes a specific action the performers could be doing while playing their instruments. It adds an engaging visual element to the description of the performance. (III) are wearing black helmets: This option provides a detail about the performers' appearance. However, it does not add much to the context and may not be the best choice in comparison to other options. (IV) are playing the drums run on the ground: This option seems to have grammatical errors and is difficult to understand. It is unclear what it means for the drums to \\"run on the ground,\\" making it an unsuitable choice.

These deposits can range in size from the size of a grain of sand to a large golf ball. You will notice a yellowish tint to the skin or the whites of your eyes and white or chalky stools. Jaundice usually occurs when gallstones block the bile duct, causing a backup of bile into the liver. The bile may begin leaking into your bloodstream. Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder. It can be caused by gallstones, tumors, or other gallbladder problems. These attacks often result in severe pain that can generally occur along the right side of the body or between the shoulder blades. This pain is often accompanied by nausea and other stomach discomfort. A buildup of too much bile in the gallbladder can cause gallbladder attacks. Different people experience gallbladder attacks differently. Although pain typically is on the right side, or between the shoulder blades, it may also feel like low back pain, cramps, or the like. Large or fatty meals can trigger a gallbladder attack. The attacks often occur in the evening, within hours of eating.

The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other. - Problem Child 2 is the 1991 comedy film sequel to the 1990 film \\"Problem Child\\"; a continuation of the exploits of Junior, an adopted orphan boy who deliberately wreaks comedic havoc everywhere he goes.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: Rip Off<br>Sarah was at the market. And she wanted to buy cabbage juice. And she saw a 16 ounce bottle for 6. She knew it was just cabbage and water. So she decided to buy her own juicer instead. Hypothesis: The market was where she was.","completion":"Based on the given context, we can draw several hypotheses to analyze and interpret the situation presented. Here, I will provide a detailed and long answer, breaking down the hypothesis you have mentioned, and also offer alternative hypotheses. Hypothesis 1: The market was where she was. This hypothesis is evidently accurate given the context. Sarah was described to be at the market, where she attempted to purchase cabbage juice. The market is the location of her shopping experience, and it is where she discovered the 16-ounce bottle of cabbage juice priced at 6. Alternative Hypothesis 2: Sarah believed the cabbage juice was overpriced. The context suggests that Sarah thought the price of the cabbage juice was not reasonable, given that it is just a mixture of cabbage and water. Her decision to purchase her own juicer is an indication that she found it more cost-effective to make the juice herself instead of buying it at the given price. Alternative Hypothesis 3: Sarah values self-reliance and cost-efficiency in her purchasing decisions. Sarah's choice to buy a juicer rather than purchasing the cabbage juice implies that she values the idea of being self-reliant and cost-efficient. By investing in a juicer, she will have the ability to make her own cabbage juice at a lower cost per ounce, as well as explore other juicing options, ultimately saving money in the long run. Alternative Hypothesis 4: Sarah may be concerned about the quality or freshness of the pre-packaged cabbage juice. While not explicitly mentioned in the context, it is possible that Sarah also prefers homemade juice for reasons other than cost. Knowing that the pre-packaged juice consists only of cabbage and water, she may desire more control over its quality or freshness. By using a juicer to make her own cabbage juice, Sarah can ensure that her juice is made from fresh, high-quality ingredients and has not been subjected to preservatives or additives. In conclusion, based on the context, we can validate your initial hypothesis that the market was where Sarah was. Additionally, we can derive alternative hypotheses, which include the possibility that Sarah believed the cabbage juice was overpriced, values self-reliance and cost-efficiency, and may have concerns about the quality and freshness of the pre-packaged cabbage juice. These hypotheses contribute to our understanding of the overall situation and the reasons behind Sarah's decision to buy a juicer instead of the pre-packaged juice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: It started as a corner shop herbalist in Nottingham in 1849, and grew to become one of the most recognisable names on the British high street. Now Boots the chemist is the latest home-grown brand to be sold off to an American firm – in a deal worth nearly £6billion. US giant Walgreens already owns a 45 per cent stake in the British chain, which it acquired for £4billion in 2012. It is now set to buy the remaining 55 per cent to become the sole owner. End of an era: Boots is the latest British brand to be sold off to a U.S. firm – in a deal worth nearly £6billion. Boots is the latest in a long line of well-known British brands to be sold off to foreign companies. US supermarket chain Walmart took over Asda in 1999, while Cadbury has been owned by American firm Kraft since 2010. Italian tycoon Stefano Pessina, the chairman of Boots, is set to make around £1.5billion from the deal. He and private equity firm KKR have owned the business since 2007. Walgreens and Boots have developed several joint initiatives over the past two years – for example, Boots’ popular No7 anti-ageing serums have been sold in the US by Walgreens stores. It is now possible the British outlets will stock more American brands, and may introduce US-style health screening clinics to allow customers to test their blood glucose or cholesterol levels. Walgreens bosses are planning a major cost-cutting exercise designed to save £594million by 2017, however it is unclear how this will affect the British firm’s 70,000 staff and 2,500 stores. Mr Pessina, 73, will be appointed executive vice chairman of the new business, called Walgreens Boots Alliance. He has described the deal as more of a ‘merger’ than an American takeover, adding that several British executives from Boots have already been given high-profile jobs by Walgreens. He said: ‘I strongly believe that the merger will bring significant growth opportunities for both mature and emerging markets. ‘Today’s announcement reflects the great track record and accomplishments of our people to date and I am convinced that their skills, expertise and commitment will continue to make a positive contribution.’ The sale will mean the US retailer owns more than 11,000 shops in 12 countries, as well as the largest pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution network in the world. Walgreens’ American boss, Greg Wasson, will run the new company as president and chief executive. Like Boots, Walgreens began as a single pharmacy. It was opened in 1901 by Charles R Walgreen Snr, and by 1919 had expanded to 20 stores selling food and drink as well as medicines. Much of its early success stemmed from selling whiskey on prescription during the prohibition era. Walgreens has come under fire for continuing to stock tobacco products alongside medicines, but the company claims this means it is more readily able to offer customers advice and products to help them quit smoking. When the deal was in its early stages, some suggested that Walgreens planned to move its headquarters from the US to Britain in order to save on corporation tax. But the firm has said this is not the case, and it will remain based at its current site in Chicago. Boots’ head office will stay in Nottingham, where the business was founded in 1849 by farm worker John Boot, a Methodist who felt strongly about the need to make medicines available to the poor. When he died in 1860 aged 45, his wife Mary and son Jesse took over the chain. By 1890, it had grown to more than 200 stores. ... but it could mean less queueing and cheaper medicines. By RUTH SUNDERLAND, Associate City Editor. Long queues to pick up a prescription at Boots could be a thing of the past after the chemist’s merger with Walgreens. The American giant, which has more than 8,000 outlets across the US, is more advanced when it comes to the technology it uses to run its pharmacy counters. Thanks to the superior systems, waiting times are usually shorter and pharmacists do not need to spend as much time rummaging around on the shelves behind the counter to find medicines. End of this headache? Customers wait to be served in a boots branch at Heathrow Airport, London. Boots in the UK could also copy Walgreens’ pharmacy apps. One allows customers to get a repeat prescription by scanning their medicine’s barcode on a smartphone. They can then pick up their order in just 30 minutes. At flagship Walgreens shops, there is also a no-appointment-needed doctor service, which could be replicated here. The US pharmacies offer many more vaccinations, including those for travellers going to exotic locations. If Boots began offering these services, it would save British customers the inconvenience of a trip to the doctor’s surgery for a jab. In the longer term, Boots’ American deal could lead to cheaper drugs, thanks to a separate partnership it has forged with a US wholesaler called AmerisourceBergen. After the Boots-Walgreens merger they will be able to hand in medicine orders together, putting them in a very strong position to achieve the lowest prices. Combined, the pair will be the biggest purchaser of non-patent drugs on the planet. And the traffic is not all one way. While Boots is a mid-market staple of the British shopping scene, pharmacies in the US are an entirely different matter. ‘Drugstores’ are typically cheap and cheerful bazaars where toiletries and vitamin pills nestle next to cheap electronic goods, lurid cuddly toys and even fridges full of beer. When it comes to cosmetics, drugstores offer budget brands, usually with no testers or ladies in white coats to advise. Women wanting a more upmarket experience have to head for the glitzy department stores and pay top dollar for designer lotions and potions. But Boots is set to bring a slice of the British high street to Walgreens, launching wider ranges of its well-known brands including No7 and Botanics in US stores, and recruiting in-house beauty advisers. It will sell well-loved products such as No7 lipsticks to US women, and remodel Walgreens stores along British lines. Finally, UK customers will be relieved to learn that the Advantage loyalty card will not be affected by the merger, and that the familiar ‘three for two’ offers on Boots products will continue as normal.","completion":"Boots is a popular store that started in Nottingham in 1849 as a small herbalist shop. Over time, it became very famous in the UK. Now, it is being sold to a big American company called Walgreens for £6 billion. Walgreens already owns about half of Boots. By buying the rest, they will become the only owner. This happened before with other popular brands like Asda (sold to Walmart) and Cadbury (sold to Kraft). The man in charge of Boots, Stefano Pessina, will make £1.5 billion from this deal. Boots and Walgreens have worked together in the past, like selling Boots' anti-ageing creams in America through Walgreens. Now, we might see more American things in Boots stores in the UK, and maybe even some health screening stations to check things like blood sugar or cholesterol. Walgreens wants to save some money, so they plan to cut costs by £594 million by 2017. It is not clear how this will affect the people who work at Boots and their 2,500 stores. Walgreens started just like Boots, as a small pharmacy in 1901. Today, after buying Boots, they will own over 11,000 shops in 12 countries and have the biggest network for distributing medicine. Boots might get some good things from this deal too. Walgreens has better technology for serving customers at the pharmacy counter, which means shorter waiting times.

The invasion consisted of 21 days of major combat operations, in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland invaded Iraq and deposed the Ba'athist government of Saddam Hussein. The invasion phase consisted primarily of a conventionally fought war which included the capture of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad by American forces with the implicit assistance of the United Kingdom alongside Australia and Poland. - Michael Francis Moore (born April 23, 1954) is an American documentary filmmaker and author.

The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 or more Iraqis were killed in the first 34 years of conflict. The United States officially withdrew from the country in 2011 but left private security contractors in its place to continue the war. It again became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What is the name of the passenger train that is now part of the Texas Eagle, a 1,306-mile train route operated by Amtrak, that ends in Los Angeles, California? A:","completion":"The passenger train that is now part of the Texas Eagle, a 1,306-mile train route operated by Amtrak and has its final destination in Los Angeles, California, is the Sunset Limited. To provide a better understanding of the train's historical background, service details, and the merger with the Texas Eagle, I will expand on the topic below. The Sunset Limited traces its roots back to 1894 when the Southern Pacific Railroad began operating the service as one of the oldest named trains in the United States. The train initially ran between New Orleans, Louisiana, and San Francisco, California. Over time, the service underwent numerous changes, including rerouting, discontinuation, and changes in operating companies. Amtrak took over the operation of the Sunset Limited in 1971 after its formation. The train maintained its original route between New Orleans and San Francisco until 1996. However, due to a reorganization of Amtrak's long-distance services, the Sunset Limited's western terminus was altered to Los Angeles, California. The Texas Eagle, established in 1974, initially traveled between St. Louis, Missouri, and San Antonio, Texas. The route was extended to Los Angeles in 1981, before being split into two different services in the late 1980s. The Texas Eagle was revived as a daily service between San Antonio and Chicago, Illinois, in 1990, running over 1,306 miles. The integration of the Sunset Limited with the Texas Eagle was implemented to provide passengers an easier transition between the two long-distance train services. The Texas Eagle now runs daily from Chicago to San Antonio. On select days, the Texas Eagle's train cars continue further west with the Sunset Limited service after they separate in San Antonio. Passengers traveling to destinations between San Antonio and Los Angeles can continue on the same train without the need to transfer. This combined service effectively links three major destinations: Chicago, San Antonio, and Los Angeles. Both the Texas Eagle and the Sunset Limited provide passengers with various accommodation options, including sleeper and coach services, as well as a dining car for meals during their journey. Some amenities provided by Amtrak include large observation windows, Wi-Fi access, and comfortable seating arrangements. In summary, the Sunset Limited is the passenger train that is now part of the Texas Eagle, a 1,306-mile train route operated by Amtrak. By integrating these two services, Amtrak offers a convenient travel experience as passengers can journey seamlessly across the United States from Chicago to Los Angeles, passing through several major cities and significant geographical landmarks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The index fell below the mark at points during the day but closed in milestone territory at 22,016, per the AP. (The S&P 500 ticked up incrementally to 2,477 and the Nasdaq ticked down a smidge to 6,362.) The Dow's record has prompted a flood of commentary and factoids. Examples: Biggest gainer: Since March 1, shares of Boeing had contributed 380 points to the Dow as of Wednesday morning, more than any other company and ahead of McDonald's (171), UnitedHealth (166), Caterpillar (99), and 3M (91), per CNBC. The biggest detractor? IBM had the largest loss over the same span, 251 points. Dollar's role: As the Dow has risen, the US dollar has declined, losing about 10% of its value against major world currencies. The New York Times explores how the two are related, as does USA Today, which notes that a weak dollar helps big companies that do business abroad because their products are more affordable in foreign currencies. Trump's start: The Dow's close above 22,000 means that it has risen 20% in the 183 trading days since Election Day, per the Wall Street Journal. For a new president, that's second only to George HW Bush (171 days) and ahead of Barack Obama (537), George W. Bush (1,626), and Bill Clinton (308). Hold the applause: At MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that the cheerleading over the Dow's rise is overblown, given that most Americans don't own very many shares. The rise helps the richest Americans, while the young in particular are out of luck. \\"I bought my first shares for my retirement account back in the 1970s, so I've benefited from the incredible gains since then,\\" he writes. \\"But my children are buying high, not low.\\" Warning signs: At MoneyWatch, Anthony Mirhaydari is worried about weak economic fundamentals in regard to personal income growth, manufacturing, US auto sales, consumer sentiment, and more. As for this current surge: \\"Enjoy it while it lasts.\\" Why the rise? President Trump has been touting the surging Dow for a while now, and a post at Barron's suggests he's due some of the credit. He and the GOP \\"have campaigned on business-friendly policies such as a lower corporate tax rate and softer regulations,\\" writes Nicholas Jasinski. \\"If successfully implemented, investors believe that corporate earnings will increase.\\" Also at play: low unemployment, low interest rates, and the aforementioned weak dollar.

We can combine these terms by adding them together. -15*a + 12*a = -3*a. Now our equation becomes -15 = -3*a. Step 2: Isolate the variable 'a' by dividing both sides of the equation by -3. -15 / -3 = -3*a / -3. Step 3: Simplify both sides of the equation: 5 = a.

The movie begins with a scooter chase between Harry and his nan because she didn't know it was him. Afterwards, Harry is sent to get a chicken for lunch, but they fire a machine gun at him and throw a grenade, which Harry throws into the chicken shed, blowing them up. Nan tells Harry the story of his twin brother, Otto, which Harry claims to have heard before. Suddenly, Harry and Nan then discover that their beloved pet hamster Abu is ill after he vomits a green substance on them, so they take him to the vet. He is almost put down until Harry takes him back home. Ed the vet and his assistant, Kisko, are working for Harry's neo-Nazi twin brother Otto who was abandoned by Nan in the 1970s, claiming it was because she couldn't look after them both, and was raised by Alsatians.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend didn't suffer permanent brain damage? Hint: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.

Mr. Thorndike had risen, and, in farewell, was holding out his hand to Andrews. He turned, and across the court-room the eyes of the financier and the stenographer met. At the sight of the great man, Spear flushed crimson, and then his look of despair slowly disappeared; and into his eyes there came incredulously hope and gratitude. He turned his head suddenly to the wall. Mr. Thorndike stood irresolute, and then sank back into his chair. The first man in the line was already at the railing, and the questions put to him by the judge were being repeated to him by the other assistant district attorney and a court attendant. His muttered answers were in turn repeated to the judge. \\"Says he's married, naturalized citizen, Lutheran Church, die- cutter by profession.\\" The probation officer, her hands filled with papers, bustled forward and whispered. \\"Mrs. Austin says,\\" continued the district attorney, \\"she's looked into this case, and asks to have the man turned over to her.

This is a Romance language primarily used in Romania and Moldova. Romanian is the only Eastern Romance language; its closest relatives are other Romance languages like Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan. While there's clear influence from these languages, Romanian also has features that are exclusively shared with languages spoken in the Balkans (an area encompassing countries like Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, etc.) that are not Romance languages. It's also worth noting that Romanian retains a significant amount of vocabulary from Latin, despite multiple invasions and migrations into Romania throughout history. In fact, approximately 75-85% of Romanian words are of Latin origin. To further illustrate the complexity of Romanian -- while its syntax and grammar are largely Latin-based, there are also traits from the Slavic languages, reflecting historical influences. In addition, Romanian has been subject to Greek, Turkish, and Hungarian linguistic influences due to geographical proximity or political relations, which show in the significant number of loanwords from these languages. This multicultural influence is what makes Romanian an interesting subject of study, especially for linguists.

Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Ukraine and Russia plan to approve a road map to improved trade relations on Tuesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said Sunday in a late-night interview on Ukraine's national broadcaster, Inter TV. The announcement comes just hours after a European Union officer said the EU had halted work on a trade agreement with Ukraine, after Kiev failed to show \\"clear commitment\\" to signing the deal. Stefan Fule, European commissioner for enlargement and European neighborhood policy, said earlier Sunday on Twitter that the words and deeds of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his government on the proposed pact were \\"further & further apart. Their arguments have no grounds in reality.\\" Fule said he had told Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Arbuzov in Brussels, Belgium, last week that further discussion on the agreement was conditional on a clear commitment by Kiev to sign the deal, but he had received no response. \\"Work on hold, had no answer,\\" he tweeted. Last month, Kiev spurned the agreement in favor of closer economic ties with Moscow, and the prime minister's Sunday night interview revealed new details about that relationship. Azarov said that in addition to the trade relations deal, he hoped an agreement could be reached Tuesday on gas commerce, which would hopefully provide a solution for Ukraine's unprofitable gas transportation system. \\"We hope to renew negotiations about the three-party consortium, which would include Europe as well, to provide transparent conditions for gas transit and gas transportation system management,\\" Azarov said.

In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.

During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Why did Meade lose his civil rights? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - politicians stripped him of his civil rights. - he agreed to give them up to get out of prison earlier. - not enough information - he became a convicted felon.

In a new release Thursday, WikiLeaks announced what it's calling \\"The Detainee Policies,\\" a collection of more than a hundred once-secret files outlining America's military detainee practices from Guantanamo to Iraq since 2002. WikiLeaks says it plans to release the files in chronological order to paint a picture of the evolution of America's military detainee practices since September 11th in prisons from Guantanamo to Iraq to Europe. Unlike other recent releases, with the Detainee Policies WikiLeaks seems to be focusing on history more than news: Its first release is the 2002 Guantanamo Camp Delta standard operating procedure manual, a kind of prequel to the 2003 and 2004 manuals from camp it's already published in past years. Other documents in the collection, WikiLeaks says, will show American attempts to \\"disappear\\" detainees by delaying the process of entering them into the detainment system's records, or detail psychological torture methods. \\"[The document collection] shows the excesses of the early days of war against an unknown 'enemy' and how these policies matured and evolved, ultimately deriving into the permanent state of exception that the United States now finds itself in, a decade later,\\" Assange writes in a statement to the press. \\"We call upon lawyers, NGOs, human rights activists and the public to mine the 'Detainee Policies' and investigate important issues...to help us better understand the evolution in these policies and why they have occurred.\\" WikiLeaks' latest publication breaks with its two previous releases of 2012 from the private intelligence firm Stratfor and the Syrian government, both of which consisted of millions of hacked emails rather than a small collection of leaked documents. Just how WikiLeaks obtained the new documents isn't clear--its anonymous submission system has been down for more than two years, with no new conduit for secure document leaks in sight. Lately even members of Anonymous, the hacker group that has long supported WikiLeaks and took credit for supplying the Syria and Stratfor leaks, publicly broke with the group after it created a donation-based paywall around its content. With the Detainee Policies, however, WikiLeaks seems to have removed that pop-up fundraising page. Guantanamo and the fate of its non-citizen detainees has been a recurring theme for WikiLeaks, beginning with its leak in 2007 of the 2003 operating manual for the camp through its 2011 release of 759 Guantanamo detainees' secret files. With WikiLeaks' founder now cooped up in London's Ecuadorean embassy and facing potential criminal charges in the United States, the subject may weigh on Assange's mind more than ever.

The latest release by the anti-secrecy site comes as Assange, who faces charges of rape and sexual assault in Sweden, remains holed up in the Ecuadoran embassy in London with what Quito says are health problems. Assange said in a statement that the newly released documents exposed military detention policies at camps in Iraq and at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Among the documents is the 2002 manual for staff at Camp Delta at Guantanamo, shortly after it was set up by US President George W. Bush to house alleged Al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees from the \\"war on terror\\". \\"This document is of significant historical importance. Guantanamo Bay has become the symbol for systematised human rights abuse in the West with good reason,\\" said Assange, the founder of the website. He added: \\"'The 'Detainee Policies' show the anatomy of the beast that is post-9/11 detention, the carving out of a dark space where law and rights do not apply, where persons can be detained without a trace at the convenience of the US Department of Defense. \\"It shows the excesses of the early days of war against an unknown 'enemy' and how these policies matured and evolved, ultimately deriving into the permanent state of exception that the United States now finds itself in, a decade later.\\" US President Barack Obama vowed within hours of taking office in January 2009 that he would close Guantanamo Bay, saying it was acting as a recruiting tool for Islamist extremists. But Obama has so far failed to do so in the face of deep opposition in Congress to moving inmates to the US mainland, and several people accused of involvement in the 9/11 plots are on trial at the camp. WikiLeaks first enraged Washington in 2010 by publishing a flood of secret military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as a huge cache of diplomatic cables from US embassies across the world. Assange, 41, walked into the Ecuadoran embassy in London on June 19 seeking asylum in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faces questioning over alleged rape and sexual assault. He was granted asylum on August 16 but Britain has refused to grant him safe passage out of the country, and he remains in the embassy. Ecuador said on Wednesday it has requested a meeting with Britain to discuss the health of Assange, who it says is losing weight and suffering vision problems. Copyright © 2012 AFP.

The files reveal the evolution of the U.S. military's detainee practices in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, shining a light on the treatment of detainees and the conditions they faced in various detention facilities. These documents exposed the darker side of the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which has been a symbol of human rights abuse in the Western world. The disclosure of Camp Delta's standard operating procedure manual from 2002, psychological torture methods, and attempts to \\"disappear\\" detainees by delaying their entry into the detainment system's records were some of the primary focuses in this collection of leaked files. Julian Assange's intention behind releasing these files is to uncover important issues related to the detainee policies, understanding their development, and scrutinizing the reasons behind their existence. He calls upon lawyers, NGOs, human rights activists, and the public to utilize these documents to investigate and raise awareness about the injustices faced by detainees in these facilities.

Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Alkalinity is the name given to the quantitative capacity of an aqueous solution to neutralize an acid, measuring alkalinity is important in determining a stream's ability to neutralize acidic pollution from acid rain, or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions, and which ph? Answer:","completion":"Alkalinity is a key parameter in assessing the buffering capacity of an aqueous solution, specifically its ability to neutralize acids and resist changes in pH. In the context of a stream's ability to counteract acidic pollution such as acid rain or other forms of acidic precipitation, alkalinity plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and stability of aquatic ecosystems. Acid rain or acidic precipitation is characterized by its unusually high concentrations of hydrogen ions (H+), which lower the pH of the water. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being considered neutral. Acidic substances have a pH less than 7, while alkaline substances have a pH greater than 7. Acid rain typically has a pH between 4.2 and 4.4, but can be as low as 2 in some cases. When assessing a stream's ability to neutralize acidic pollution, measuring alkalinity helps determine the degree to which the stream can buffer and maintain a stable pH. Alkalinity in water primarily comes from the presence of carbonate ions (CO3 2-), bicarbonate ions (HCO3 -), and hydroxide ions (OH-). These ions react with hydrogen ions, effectively neutralizing the acid and preventing drastic pH changes. A higher alkalinity indicates a greater buffering capacity to withstand acidic input. Healthy freshwater ecosystems usually have a pH between 6.5 and 8.5, which provides optimal living conditions for most aquatic organisms. Therefore, when measuring the alkalinity of a stream that can effectively neutralize acidic pollution from acid rain or other acidic precipitation, one would expect to see a pH value within this range. However, it is important to note that the specific pH requirement may vary depending on the particular species inhabiting the water. In summary, alkalinity represents the quantitative capacity of an aqueous solution, such as a stream, to neutralize acid and is essential in determining the stream's ability to cope with acidic pollution, such as acid rain or other forms of acidic precipitation. Ideal alkalinity would maintain the pH of the stream within the range of 6.5 to 8.5, which supports the health of most freshwater ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The passengers fought back against the terrorists, leading to the plane crashing in a field in Pennsylvania, preventing any further destruction. 2. \\"Hollywoodland\\" - Directed by Allen Coulter, this film is a noir detective story based on the real-life investigation into the mysterious death of actor George Reeves, who played Superman in the 1950s television series. 3. \\"World Trade Center\\" - Directed by Oliver Stone, this film is a drama about the rescue of two Port Authority Police officers trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks. 4. \\"The Last King of Scotland\\" - Directed by Kevin Macdonald, this film is a fictionalized adaptation of the events during the brutal regime of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, seen through the eyes of a young Scottish doctor who becomes Amin's personal physician. 5. \\"Flyboys\\" - Directed by Tony Bill, this film is inspired by the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, a group of American pilots who volunteered to fly for the French military before the United States entered World War I. These are just a few examples, and there are more films from 2006 that were based on true events or real-life stories. Thus, it would be inaccurate to say \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" was the only film of 2006 to be based on a true story."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words! Question: Why was Patch hungry? Options: - not enough information - a bird had stolen his food - he had given his last nut to another squirrel - it was two days since he had found a nut Answer:","completion":"- it was two days since he had found a nut"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gang of bikers attack driver in front of family after high-speed chase An unidentified 30-year-old man was attacked in front of his wife in child in New York City after his vehicle was pursued by a gang of motorcyclists in a high speed chase. It is not clear what started the altercation, but a video apparently taken by one of the bikers shows the gang surrounding the man’s Range Rover SUV on Manhattan’s West Side Highway Monday afternoon, the New York Post reports. In the video, at least one biker is seen slowing down and parking his bike in front of the man’s vehicle, causing him to stop. Another biker began walking threateningly toward the vehicle before the driver gunned it and smashed into several bikes and riders. The group then pursued the driver at high speeds until he got caught in traffic. At that point, another biker tried to rip open the SUV’s door, but the driver sped off again. The chase came to an end in the upper Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights when the driver was caught in traffic a second time. One biker in the video is shown ripping off his helmet and using it to smash the driver-side window of the SUV. Police sources told the New York Post that the man was slashed in front of his wife and child, who were inside the vehicle. The man was brought to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital to get stitches. New York police are investigating the attack and have not yet made any arrests. Click for more from the New York Post.

Q: Abstract: The objective of this study was to find naturally occurring anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies to anti-human thyroglobulin (anti-hTg) idiotype in sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. Sera from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), Graves' disease (GD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sera from normal subjects were tested for the presence of anti-Id antibodies against mouse anti-hTg monoclonal antibodies (McAb) in indirect ELISA and in indirect solid-phase RIA. Microtitration plates were coated with six McAb, five of them directed against different epitopes on hTg molecule, and then incubated with patients' sera. The bound antibody was detected with either peroxidase or 125I-labeled anti-human IgG. The specific positive reaction was observed in four of 40 patients with HT, in two of 26 patients with GD, in seven of 58 patients with RA, and in none of 20 normal subjects. The detected binding was due to the presence of anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies and not to Tg-anti-Tg circulating immune complexes, as the positive sera did not contain hTg when resolved on SDS-PAGE, nor did they bind to all anti-hTg McAb tested. The binding was dose dependent, and titers of anti-Id antibodies varied from 1:243 to 1:2187. The binding could be inhibited up to 50% by hTg, but not by the thyroid microsomal antigen, indicating that some of those anti-Id might represent the internal image of the antigen. Serum from the patient 3403, showing the strongest reactivity against McAb A-3, was chosen for IgG purification and F(ab')2 fragment isolation. The 3403 F(ab')2 fragment, but not the Fc fragment, was found to react specifically with four mouse anti-hTg McAb but not with the control mouse IgG. Thus, the obtained results permit the conclusion that anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies could occur naturally during the course of thyroid autoimmune disorders. A:","completion":"anti-idiotypic antibodies in autoimmune thyroid disease To come up with this answer, I identified the main focus of the study from the abstract, which was to find \\"anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies to anti-human thyroglobulin (anti-hTg) idiotype in sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.\\" This phrase captures the key element of the research and its contribution to the understanding of autoimmune thyroid disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: How to make a phone call using old rotary phone?","completion":"To make a phone call using an old rotary phone, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Find the phone number: Before dialing, make sure you have the phone number of the person or business you wish to call. The number should consist of an area code (if required) and the local number. 2. Prepare the rotary phone: Place the rotary phone on a flat surface, like a table or desk, and ensure that the phone line is connected to the wall. 3. Pick up the handset: Lift the handset off the phone, and hold it to your ear. You should hear a dial tone. This signifies that the phone line is active and ready for you to dial the number. 4. Dial the area code (if required): If you need to include an area code, locate the first digit of the area code on the rotary dial. With your finger in the hole, rotate the dial clockwise until it reaches the metal stopper. Release the dial, allowing it to return to its starting position. Repeat this process for each digit of the area code. Remember to wait for the dial to return to its starting position before moving on to the next digit. 5. Dial the local number: Dial the local number by rotating the dial for each digit, just as you did for the area code. Ensure you wait for the dial to return to its starting position between each digit. 6. Allow the phone to connect: Once you have finished dialing the complete phone number, the telephone network will begin to connect your call. After a few seconds, you should hear ringing on the other end. Wait for the person you are calling to answer the phone. 7. Speak with the person: When the person on the other end picks up, you can begin your conversation. Hold the handset close to your mouth and speak clearly. 8. End the call: Once you finish your conversation, gently place the handset back onto the cradle of the phone. This action disconnects the call and returns the phone to a ready state for the next call. By following these steps, you'll successfully make a call on an old rotary phone while respecting the mechanical process involved in dialing and connecting to the desired phone number."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Put the corn in foil with oil, throw it on the low grill and cook and shake until it's done popping..","completion":"I choose option A. Here's how I would make popcorn, step by step, following option A: 1. Gather the necessary ingredients and utensils, including popcorn kernels, oil, a large pan with a lid, and a heatproof spatula. 2. Place the pan on the stovetop, and add an appropriate amount of oil. This may vary depending on the size of the pan, but generally, a thin layer that covers the entire bottom of the pan is sufficient. 3. Turn on the stove to medium heat, allowing the oil to warm up evenly. The proper temperature is important for effective popping. It would be good to also test if the oil is hot enough by dropping one or two kernels; if they pop quickly, the oil is ready. 4. Once the oil reaches the correct temperature, add a single layer of kernels to the pan, ensuring they are evenly distributed in the oil. It is necessary not to overcrowd the pan to prevent some kernels from burning before others have a chance to pop. 5. As soon as the first few kernels begin to pop, quickly place the lid on the pan to avoid any popped corn from flying out of the pan and to keep in the steam that helps the kernels pop. 6. Using a heatproof spatula, occasionally shake the pan gently to move the kernels around, preventing them from burning at the bottom of the pan, promoting even heat distribution, and encouraging more kernels to pop. 7. Keep cooking the kernels until the popping significantly slows down or ceases. At this point, it is safe to assume that most of the kernels have popped. 8. Turn off the heat and, carefully using an oven mitt or heatproof handle if necessary, remove the pan from the stove. Wait for a few seconds for any last few pops, and then slowly lift the lid away from your face to avoid any steam. 9. Pour the popped popcorn into a large bowl and season it to taste with salt, butter, or your preferred spices and enjoy. I choose this option because it is a simple yet effective way of making popcorn, and it allows for more control over the cooking process. This method is also widely used and produces consistent results."},{"prompt":"The Towle WC aka Towle TA-1 was a custom built aircraft for a 1929 round-the world flight.

Article: Apple a day may poison children Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding the pesticide safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research. Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report. Question: The reason why \\"Apple a day may poison children\\" is that _ . - there are some pests in the apple - children would get a poisonous level of pesticides because of the remains on the apple - there are always more pesticides on the apples produced in Britain - the apple is too hard for children to eat The answer is:","completion":"children would get a poisonous level of pesticides because of the remains on the apple"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Perhaps only \\"Manos: The Hands of Fate\\" dragged more than \\"Dukes\\". I had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point. Let's touch on a few... There was a noticeable script death and rebirth when Sheev is talking to the Dukes and they don't respond. He shrugs and moves on, since neither the Knoxville or Scott know what he's talking about (nor do we). It was like the engine died and was restarted. The few times the General Lee flew through the air weren't even that exciting. Nothing I haven't seen on the TV Series. Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo is upset at Luke for stealing the girl he liked. The only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it (although roughly). The rest of the time it seems distant and forced. Seann William Scott's awful, horrendous accent (or lack thereof). I hated Willie Nelson's performance. Were bad jokes supposed to be endearing? I wanted him to disappear. Jessica Simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen. She actually felt like one of the better actors in the film. That's telling you how horrible this movie is. She's a goddess. During the climax of the film, I was rooting for Boss Hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices. A nuclear bomb would have sufficed. This is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film, but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film.

The reviewer expresses considerable disappointment and frustration with various aspects of the movie, such as the plot, script, acting, and chemistry among the actors. They compare the film to another notoriously bad movie, \\"Manos: The Hands of Fate,\\" which sets the tone of dissatisfaction from the beginning. The reviewer points out several issues with the film, including: 1. The script's inconsistencies, awkward transitions and failure to engage the audience. 2. A lack of excitement in the action sequences, specifically mentioning the General Lee stunt scenes. 3. Poor chemistry between the lead actors, Knoxville and Scott, with their interactions feeling distant and forced. 4. Seann William Scott's unconvincing accent. 5. A distaste for Willie Nelson's performance and his character's attempts at humor. 6. A preference for the supposed villain's (Boss Hogg) victory during the climax, as opposed to siding with the protagonists. However, there is a single positive sentiment mentioned in the review. The reviewer praises Jessica Simpson's performance and refers to her as one of the better actors in the film, calling her a \\"goddess.\\" In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is primarily negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration at the missed opportunity to create a heartwarming film and a desire to erase and start over."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dora is a young Latina girl who goes on various adventures in an animated world with her talking purple backpack and an anthropomorphic monkey named Boots. Created by Chris Gifford, Valerie Walsh, and Eric Weiner, the show 'Dora the Explorer' debuted on Nickelodeon and is popular among pre-school age children. Dora was designed to introduce viewers to Spanish. Throughout each episode, Dora teaches Spanish words or phrases to the viewers. For instance, she often asks viewers to say a Spanish word or phrase along with her to overcome a problem. This interactive component quickly became a signature part of the show, contributing to its popularity and success. Plus, making language learning a part of an epic adventure with fun characters makes the learning feel more like play than a chore. The anthropomorphic blue-booted monkey named Boots is Dora's best friend and main travel companion. He's called Boots because of his striking red boots. Boots is always seen on Dora's various trips and provides her assistance and information during their adventures. His friendly, enthusiastic personality, and undying optimism, charm children who are watching. The character of Swiper is a sneaky fox who tries to throw Dora and Boots off track during their missions. Swiper is always out to steal something from Dora, hence the name \\"Swiper\\". Dora and Boots often prevent Swiper from stealing by saying, \\"Swiper, no swiping!\\" three times. Despite his usual antagonistic role, Swiper is not a traditional villain. At times, he's shown to have a good heart and even helps Dora and Boots on occasion. The show gained massive popularity and critical acclaim globally not only for its entertainment value but also for its educational content. Dora the Explorer was a trailblazing show that popularized the incorporation of learning a foreign language into kid's TV programs. Over the years, it has inspired several spin-offs, merchandise, video games, and even a live-action movie adaptation. It has left a remarkable impact on kids' TV programming and continues to be loved by many."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rick Osterloh, president of Motorola, told the BBC his company had a \\"different philosophy\\". And he criticised Apple in turn, calling its prices \\"outrageous\\". Sir Jonathan specifically asked the New Yorker magazine not to name the company he had been \\"scathing about\\", but a campaign launched by Motorola in late 2013 matches the description he gave. \\"Their value proposition was, 'Make it whatever you want.

Mr Osterloh of the scheme: \\"Our belief is that the end user should be directly involved in the process of designing products. \\"We're making the entire product line accessible. \\"And frankly, we're taking a directly opposite approach to them [Apple].\\" He added that he believed this difference in strategy went wider than design. \\"We do see a real dichotomy in this marketplace, where you've got people like Apple making so much money and charging such outrageous prices.

Brannan's ex-girlfriend Christine Corley says that he falsely accused her of hitting him and is a 'master manipulator' Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Tennis Pro Accused of Assault: The Twisted Tale of Ivan Brannan, Master Manipulator In a recent shocking revelation, Ivan Brannan, 28, has accused a professional tennis player of assaulting him in a Florida gym on Valentine's Day. Brannan, a former tennis prodigy himself, has been embroiled in a tumultuous relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Christine Corley, who now claims that Brannan is a \\"master manipulator\\" and has a history of making false accusations. The alleged assault reportedly occurred on the romantic holiday, when Brannan claims that he had been punched by the unnamed tennis pro. The incident has sent shockwaves through the sports community, as it would signify severe misconduct on the part of a professional athlete. A police report has been filed, and an investigation is currently underway to determine the veracity of Brannan's allegations. However, it seems that Brannan's credibility is being called into question by none other than his ex-girlfriend, Christine Corley. In an exclusive interview, Corley revealed that Brannan had falsely accused her of hitting him in the past. She described her former flame as a \\"master manipulator\\" with a penchant for twisting the truth to serve his purposes. Corley's allegations against Brannan paint a troubling picture of a man who may stop at nothing to create drama and attention. In her words, Brannan used the accusations against her to manipulate and control her, turning their relationship into a toxic, emotionally fraught experience. With her account in mind, it begs the question: could Brannan be fabricating the assault charges against the tennis pro? While the investigation is still ongoing, the unraveling story raises important concerns about character assassination and the consequences of manipulating the truth. Not only do false allegations damage the reputations of the accused, but they also have a lasting impact on the credibility of actual victims of assault. Should Brannan's claims prove to be unfounded, there may be severe repercussions for both his reputation and the credibility of similar accusations in the future. In the world of professional sports, personal drama can often overshadow the talent and dedication of athletes. Fans and the media alike have long been captivated by controversies and scandals. However, it is crucial to maintain a balanced perspective and recognize the importance of due process, especially when dealing with serious accusations like Brannan's. As the investigation into these allegations continues, it remains to be seen whether Ivan Brannan's claims hold any truth or if they are simply the machinations of a \\"master manipulator\\". Either way, it is a disheartening story that reminds us that even in the world of professional sports, personal drama can still cast a long shadow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The \\"Slow\\" button did not work with games that had a pause menu or pause screen and can interfere with jumping and shooting. The NES Max also had the Turbo Feature, but it was not adjustable, in contrast with the Advantage. It also did not have the \\"Slow\\" button.

Zeus Answer:","completion":"Title: The Divine Quest of Perseus Genre: Fantasy, Adventure, Action Plot: In the celestial realm, a bitter rivalry arises between the gods as they compete for influence over the mortal world. Demigods and heroes are granted special favors by their divine parents to undo their rival's works, but Zeus, the King of the Gods, is wary of the escalating conflict. Frustrated by the gods' interference, he devises a plan to demonstrate the true power of the divine - a quest that no mortal or god has ever completed. Zeus selects Perseus, his demigod son, to undertake this divine quest. However, to ensure Perseus doesn't receive unfair help from other gods, Zeus declares that only one gift may be offered to him - Athena's intellect and wisdom. Thus, Zeus commands Athena to give Perseus her legendary and wise owl, Bubo. The owl Bubo is gifted to Perseus and serves as a wise and intelligent guide to help him fulfill this impossible task. They set off on their journey, gathering a crew of skilled warriors and misfits, each with unique abilities crucial to the success of their quest. Together, they embark on an epic adventure through a mythological world filled with treacherous landscapes, cursed creatures, and powerful sorcery. As their journey unfolds, they uncover a fiendish plot orchestrated by Hades, the God of the Underworld, who seeks to usurp Zeus and seize control of the heavens. To do so, Hades conspires with titans and monsters long thought vanquished, terrorizing the world and provoking chaos. Perseus and his crew must navigate the twisted machinations of divine politics and confront their own inner fears as they draw closer to their final confrontation with Hades. The climax of the film sees Perseus and his companions infiltrate Hades' stronghold within the Underworld, where they must face their most lethal trials yet. Through their courage, cunning, and the wise guidance of Bubo, they thwart Hades' minions and persevere against overwhelming odds. With the celestial realm hanging in the balance, Perseus confronts Hades in an epic battle of power, fate, and destiny. In the end, Perseus triumphs, not through brute force but through his wisdom and intellect, revealing the true power of Zeus and Athena's gift. The gods, humbled by the might of Perseus' resilience and wisdom, finally recognize the importance of harmony and balance between the celestial and mortal worlds. Zeus restores peace among the gods and decrees that they must act with restraint in guiding humanity's destiny. With his quest complete, Perseus returns to the mortal realm as a legend, the embodiment of wisdom and heroism. The tale of his divine quest and triumph echoes through the ages, inspiring countless generations to strive for wisdom and greatness in the face of adversity. The Divine Quest of Perseus is an epic cinematic experience that showcases the power of wisdom, the importance of balance, and the potential for greatness hidden within every mortal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Great App with Room for Improvement Review: I have been using the de.danoeh.antennapod app for the last few months and overall, it’s been a good experience worthy of a 4-star rating. My favorite highlight of the app has to be the user-friendly interface. It is easy to navigate through the app and find all its features which prove to be quite impressive. The functionality to download podcasts and listen to them offline is something I frequently use, and the quality of audio is truly commendable. Moreover, the feature of automatic deletion of episodes post their playback contributes significantly to managing the phone's storage, adding more convenience to the user experience. The app also houses a wide variety of podcasts catering to different range of tastes, which is quite vibrant and fascinating. Despite the praise, the reason I am holding back a star for now is because there’s always room for improvement. On a few occasions, the app has crashed unexpectedly during conveniently timed auto-updates. The stability could be improved for a seamless experience that such a great platform deserves. Also, the search function could do with a bit of tweaking to deliver more precise results. In conclusion, the de.danoeh.antennapod App is undeniably a great platform for podcast lovers, and with some minor updates, it can reach its full potential of being a top-tier application.

Visited Moe's for the first time in about a year for their birthday promo (Free Burrito w/ purchase of a large drink), and I have to say I was let down relative to my relatively mild expectations. On a positive side, Moe's definitely has their lunch process nailed down to an efficient machine. They pump people quick enough through the line that there's often a bottleneck and a battlefield at the open salsa station and drink stand. Relative to the food, as many others have referenced, Moe's offers your typical Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. style build-your-own Mexican bar. Being similarly priced to those options, the quality of Moe's ingredients simply doesn't compare and can best be described as bland at best. The \\"free\\" chips with every meal (I hate these type of sales gimmicks) are honestly outgunned by your standard grocery store Tostidos fare.

Gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtle. He is loosed by a nuclear explosion. He heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk (oh yeah, power lines. I almost forgot). At one time, early in the film, he befriends a little boy, and instead of just throwing him away, or squashing him, he places him down on the ground. Safe. From then on we have to watch this chubby faced little twerp show up and run away, show up and run away, show up and run away. For some reason, Gammera is able to hear this kid from 20,000 feet away.

These cells are typically made from silicon, a semiconductor material that is abundant in the Earth's crust. The silicon cells in the solar panels can be either monocrystalline or polycrystalline. The process of converting sunlight into electricity using a solar panel involves the following steps: 1. Absorption of sunlight: When sunlight, in the form of photons, strikes the surface of the solar panel, it may either be absorbed by the solar cells, reflected off the surface, or pass through the panel. 2. Generation of electron-hole pairs: When photons with sufficient energy are absorbed by the semiconductor material in the solar cells, they transfer their energy to the electrons present in the material's atoms. This energy transfer causes the electrons to break free from their parent atoms, leaving behind an empty space called a \\"hole.\\" This generation of free electrons and holes is the initial step in the conversion of sunlight into electricity. 3. Separation of charge carriers: In a solar cell, a p-n junction is created by introducing impurities into the semiconductor material. The p-n junction separates the solar cell into two regions with different electric charge concentrations: the p-type region with an excess of positive charges, and the n-type region with an excess of negative charges. When free electrons and holes are generated by the absorption of sunlight, they are quickly separated by the electric field established at the p-n junction. The electrons move towards the n-type region, while the holes travel towards the p-type region. 4. Collection of charge carriers: As the negatively charged electrons are attracted towards the n-type region and the positively charged holes towards the p-type region, these charge carriers are collected by metal contacts placed on the top and bottom surfaces of the solar cell. This creates a flow of electric current from the top contact to the bottom contact. 5. Conversion of direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC): The current generated by a solar panel is direct current (DC). However, most electrical devices and appliances used in homes and businesses operate on alternating current (AC). Therefore, the DC current generated by the solar panel needs to be converted into AC using a device called an inverter. In summary, a solar panel converts sunlight into electricity by absorbing photons, generating free electrons and holes, separating the charge carriers, collecting them via metal contacts to produce an electric current, and finally, converting the generated direct current into alternating current for use in homes and businesses. The process of converting sunlight into electricity in a solar panel does not involve \\"adding heat.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here are the explanations for why the other answers are wrong: [i] up and the boy in a red shirt gives him a hard time - This option seems unrelated to the main idea and introduces a conflict that isn't supported by the given information. [ii] up and throw the ball up onto the orange striped pole - This sentence doesn't fit the original idea of describing the boys playing ping pong. Instead, it talks about a specific action of throwing the ball onto a pole, which doesn't make sense in the context of playing ping pong. [iv] up and sit on a green ping pong table and play - This option is problematic because sitting on a ping pong table is not how the game is played. It also doesn't make sense considering the boys are already playing the game in a big room, and the description of the table as green is not relevant to the main idea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer choices: - a cuticle - bones - Joules - neurons - the skin - loose soil - fibrils - muscle A:","completion":"The correct answer is: fibrils. Cartilage is a type of connective tissue found in many areas of the body, including the joints, ears, nose, bronchial tubes, and between the bones of the spine and ribs. It's a flexible and robust material that functions to support, connect, and cushion various body structures. The fundamental component of cartilage is a protein called collagen, which arranges itself into an overlapping network of long, thin structures known as fibrils. These fibrils intertwine and bundle together to provide cartilage with its characteristic strength and elasticity. Let's debunk the other choices: - A cuticle, in biology, refers to the outermost protective layer found in various organisms like plants and insects. It is non-living material and is not a part of human cartilage. - Bones are rigid structures that make up the skeleton. They provide support and protection for the body and are not a part of the cartilage, although they do interact with cartilage. - Joules is a unit of measurement for energy or work in the International System of Units. It is utterly unrelated to the biological makeup of cartilage. - Neurons are the basic units of the nervous system. They are specialized cells that are involved in transmitting signals and carrying out the functions of the nervous system. They are not involved in the structure of cartilage. - The skin is the body's largest organ. It serves to protect the body from the outside environment. While skin and cartilage both fall under the category of connective tissue, they are composed of different types of cells and serve different functions. - Loose soil does not have any association with cartilage. This term is a geologic concept and is irrelevant to the composition of cartilage. - Muscles are tissue that contracts and relaxes to create movement. Muscles and cartilage are separate types of tissue with different structures and roles within the body.

Have you heard of it.'? Not everyone in the class could take part, but luckily I could. The school chooses a 'twin school' in a different area of the world. Our head teacher chose a school in Uganda. They gave us someone to write to from that school. For three months, I've written to a girl called Louisa, who is the same age as me. It' s been more interesting to hear about her life. She' s told me all about her school and described her daily life. I can' t believe that her School doesn' t. have any electricity. She goes to 'school from eight o' clock in the morning until six. O'clock. in the evening. I can' t believe how lucky we are here! She' s also told me that she often can' t go to school because she has to look after her baby brother and sister. She's tried to teach me some of her language and it' s really difficult. I love it because it' s the first time I' ve thought about what life must be like somewhere else. I can' t believe people miss classes here when everything is so easy for us. I think more people should help out with projects like this. At the weekend we' re going to have a sports day to help raise money to send to the school. Perhaps one day I'll be able to go to Uganda and meet Louisa myself--who knows?

Your fast and weight loss goals can cause stress, leading to an increase in cortisol. Try relaxation strategies such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or a hobby to help you lower your stress. Try coloring. Go for a stroll in nature. Journal your thoughts. Read a book. Talk things out with a friend. Listen to calming music. Snuggle with a pet or family member. If you spend time around food, you’ll think about it for the rest of the day. For example, avoid going out to lunch with friends while you're fasting. Similarly, tuning into a TV show about baking will spark cravings. Replace activities that revolve around food with other activities that will occupy your mind. Focus on your faith through prayer, reflection, reading your Quran, and attending religious services. Play a game with friends, such as a board game. Read a book. Ask to hold your work meetings in the boardroom or in someone’s office. A goal of Ramadan is to be charitable and think of others, so volunteer to help those in the community. You can help a nonprofit, support people through your mosque, or visit those in need. Make meals for others. Visit with the sick. Donate your skills to a charity. Bring items that you no longer use to those who are in need. Ramadan is a holy holiday, so it makes sense to spend plenty of time in prayer. You can also use prayer as a way to keep your mind off food while deepening your faith. If you start to think about food, turn your thoughts to prayer. Consider keeping a prayer on you to read when your thoughts are muddled. This way you can still engage in prayer even if you’re feeling distracted. You are encouraged to read your Quran during Ramadan, and doing so can help you remember why you are celebrating Ramadan. Instead of your thoughts being consumed with your desire to eat before fasting begins again at sunrise, you can reflect on the teachings and your beliefs.

The increase in predation will reduce the number of eggs that hatch and survive, which directly affects the second effect mentioned, which is the incubation of eggs by the parent(s). This increased predation would have a negative impact on the bird population, as fewer eggs will survive to hatch, reducing the number of baby birds that can be taken care of by the mother and/or father. Consequently, fewer baby birds will grow up, develop flight feathers, learn to fly, leave the nest, and eventually find mates and mate themselves.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Kidneys The kidneys participate in several complex endocrine pathways and produce certain hormones. A decline in blood flow to the kidneys stimulates them to release the enzyme renin, triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system, and stimulating the reabsorption of sodium and water. The reabsorption increases blood flow and blood pressure. The kidneys also play a role in regulating blood calcium levels through the production of calcitriol from vitamin D3, which is released in response to the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). In addition, the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) in response to low oxygen levels. EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the bone marrow, thereby increasing oxygen delivery to tissues.

Desktop users may find the USB ports on the back or the front of the desktop tower, though iMacs have the USB ports on the back of the monitor itself. There are two main types of USB ports found on modern computers: USB 3.0 — A thin, rectangular slot that's about 3/4 of an inch (a little under two centimeters) wide. You should see a chunk of plastic in the upper half of this slot. USB 3.0 slots are found on the majority of Windows computers and on most Mac computers manufactured prior to 2016. USB-C — A thin, oval slot that's about 1/2 of an inch (a little over a centimeter) wide. These are most commonly found on MacBook and MacBook Pro computers, though some Windows laptops also have USB-C ports. If your computer has both types of port, you're free to use whichever port you like depending on your USB flash drive type. Look at the metal connector end of your flash drive: If the connector is rectangular and has a piece of plastic taking up part of the connector, you have a USB 3.0 flash drive. If the connector is oval and has no piece of plastic inside of it, you have a USB-C flash drive. If the flash drive that you want to use is a USB 3.0 version but your computer uses USB-C ports, you'll need to buy a USB-C adapter and plug it into the USB-C port on your computer. This is most common on MacBooks and MacBook Pros from 2016 and up, though some Windows computers also have only USB-C ports. If you're using a USB 3.0 flash drive, make sure that the plastic piece in the flash drive's connector is at the bottom of the flash drive so as to slide under the piece of plastic that's at the top of the USB 3.0 port. USB-C flash drives can be inserted either way. If you're using a USB-C adapter, you'll plug your USB flash drive into a USB 3.9 slot in the adapter instead.

Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels really wants to end debate that his show lacks diversity. In addition to hiring stand-up comic Sasheer Zamata as a new cast member on the sketch comedy show, he's also added two new black comediennes to join the white male-dominated writer's room. Comediennes LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones tried out for the opening cast member position last month, and the show's producers were so impressed with their auditions that they were hired to write the jokes. Scroll down for video. New hires: LaKendra Tookes (left) and Leslie Jones (right) were hired as Saturday Night Live writers after auditioning for a cast member position last month. They will join a mostly white male-dominated writer's room on the sketch comedy show as creator Lorne Michaels seeks to address lack of diversity complaints. The new writer announcement comes after Zamata's hiring was made official on Monday. Zamata will be the first black female cast member in six years when she makes her debut on the January 18 episode hosted by Drake. Jones was a finalist for Zamata's cast member slot, and has guest starred on such shows as The League and Sullivan & Son. She has performed at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles and her stand-up special 'Problem Child' was broadcast on Showtime. Tookes on the other hand is a former news reporter from Florida who has performed her comedy at iO West theater in Los Angeles. While neither women is slated to perform on the show, many SNL writers in the past have made the transition from writer to performer. Tina Fey and Jason Sudeikis made the jump, as well as current featured player Mike O'Brien. Hired: It was announced on Monday that Sasheer Zamata will be the newest addition to Saturday Night Live, filling a black female cast member void created when Maya Rudolph left the show in 2007. Live from New York: Zamata will make her debut on Saturday Night Live during the January 18 episode hosted by Drake. Rumors that a new player might be added. to the cast started last month, when Gothamist reported that auditions. were held earlier at the Groundlings theater for black. female comediennes in LA. The rumor was confirmed by SNL's creator and producer Lorne Michaels who told the New York Times. that a black female cast member will join the cast in January - the. first time Michaels can remember adding a cast member mid-season. 'All told we've seen about 25 people,' Michaels told the Times. 'A lot of people we saw are really good. Hopefully we'll come out of the process well.' Michaels. also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was. initially hiring for the current season this past fall. He. saw the two women during a performance in Chicago, but their. performances weren't as strong when they were invited to New York for. the final auditions. 'Then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized, it looks a different way,' he said. That's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season. Michaels. says he can't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of. the season, but says he has added players in March or April to get them. into the last episodes of the season. While many have criticized the show. for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady. Michelle Obama, Beyonce or Oprah, Michaels says that has nothing to do. with his hiring decision. 'That's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you don't judge comedy that way. Versatility is what we look for.' This will be the first time since 2007 that SNL has had a woman of African-American heritage on the show. Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live. has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the. 1985-86 season on the show. No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since. The two current black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag. As a result, there have been no. sketches on the weekly program featuring black females this season, excepting the episode which was hosted by Kerry Washington. 'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Maya Rudolph who is biracial. Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past. 'It's not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.' News of the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet. Actress Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance. 'It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com. 'I can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that I had never met,' she said. It's happening: SNL's creator Lorne Michaels confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this January following reports that a 'secret' audition were held earlier this month in LA (those asked to audition pictured) Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe also auditioned according to Jezebel. 'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said. 'We were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed to the max.' The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high-profile departure of cast member and head Seth Meyers, who will leave in the New Year to host Late Night when Jimmy Fallon goes to The Tonight Show. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels has addressed concerns about the show's lack of diversity by hiring stand-up comic Sasheer Zamata as a new cast member and adding two new black comediennes, LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones, to the writer's room.

Only five Indian bodies were recovered from the battle, and the New Englanders decapitated the corpses and set the severed heads on pikes surrounding Canso's new fort. During the war, a church was erected at the Catholic mission in the Mi'kmaq village of Shubenacadie . In 1723, the village of Canso, Nova Scotia was raided again by the Mi'kmaqs, who killed five fishermen, so the New Englanders built a 12-gun blockhouse to guard the village and fishery.:62 The worst moment of the war for Annapolis Royal came on July 4, 1724 when a group of 60 Mi'kmaqs and Maliseets raided the capital. They killed and scalped a sergeant and a private, wounded four more soldiers, and terrorized the village. They also burned houses and took prisoners.:164-165 The New Englanders responded by executing one of the Mi'kmaq hostages on the same spot where the sergeant was killed. They also burned three Acadian houses in retaliation. As a result of the raid, three blockhouses were built to protect the town.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context states that if a person cannot measure the amount of detergent they've used when loading the dishwasher, it may potentially affect the dishwasher's cleaning performance. This statement is suggesting that there is a possibility that the dishwasher will not clean as well, given inaccurate measurements of detergent used. Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process of dishwashing. The proper amount of detergent plays a crucial role in the dishwashing process, as it is responsible for breaking down and removing food particles, grease, and stains from the dishes. Insufficient detergent may not provide enough cleaning power, which might result in unclean dishes or spotting. Overuse of detergent, on the other hand, can cause excess foam and may damage the dishwasher itself, or leave a residue on the dishes. To minimize the impact of this perturbation, one could: 1. Use a well-formulated detergent or detergent pods that provide pre-measured amounts of detergent. This eliminates the need for the person to measure the detergent themselves. 2. Familiarize oneself with the manufacturer's recommended detergent amount. Dishwasher manuals and detergent packaging usually provide guidelines for appropriate detergent usage based on the dishwasher's size and the level of soil on the dishes. 3. Adjust detergent levels based on the hardness of the water. Hard water typically requires more detergent, while soft water requires less. By understanding local water conditions, one can use detergent more effectively and minimize the effects of the perturbation. In conclusion, the inability to measure the amount of detergent used does have an indirect effect on the dishwashing process. To achieve optimal cleaning performance, using the correct amount of detergent is essential. Implementing the aforementioned precautions can help minimize the impact of this perturbation on the dishwashing process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jake Mamo crossed too before McGillvary and Murphy each added a second. Mamo also had two tries chalked off, with Warrington's only response coming through a Tom Lineham try on 53 minutes. Former Salford, Hull and St Helens utility back Turner scored on his debut as Huddersfield's third victory in five matches moved them within a point of Catalans Dragons, who they face next Saturday.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. Question: What is the most probable reason why the participants decided to join the trails? Options: - not enough information - to stop eating at night - to attempt to lose weight - to be able to eat more during the day A:","completion":"The most probable reason why the participants decided to join the trials is: - to attempt to lose weight. The study focuses on weight loss and examines the effects of restricting night time eating.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Most commentators have considered suicide to be the more likely cause of whose death?, using the article: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in..., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, the more likely cause of death for Philip Heseltine, also known as the English composer Peter Warlock, is considered to be suicide. Several factors support this theory: 1. Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and his partner Barbara Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by coal gas poisoning. 2. The outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat, which might suggest that Heseltine was making final arrangements before taking his own life. 3. The fact that Heseltine placed his young cat outside the room before turning on the lethal gas could indicate a deliberate act, as he potentially wanted to take care of the animal before committing suicide. While Heseltine's son, Nigel Heseltine, later introduced a theory that his father was murdered by Bernard Van Dieren, this theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The overwhelming evidence and circumstances surrounding Heseltine's death have led most experts to believe that suicide is the more likely cause."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I disagree entirely with the viewer comments that have described *Guns, Germs and Steel* as \\"politically correct\\" and \\"neo-Marxist.\\" They cannot have watched the same series that *I* did. The series *I* watched depicted the history of European colonisation in the Americas and southern Africa with no particular inaccuracies. I saw nothing in the series that portrayed Europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky, though Europeans often *were* lucky - and there's nothing wrong with luck. Neither did I see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things. If anything, the Inca was rather arrogant - as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with foreigners, if his country has not been conquered in living memory by any other world power. I certainly saw nothing that could be construed as Marxist or Neo-Marxist, except by the most incredibly elastic of imaginations. Otherwise, many African peoples *do* have a built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans lack. At the time they were at the height of their successes, the Aztec, Maya and Inca civilisations *were* as advanced as any other in the world - and as wealthy; sometimes more so. Aboriginal American and Khoi-San populations *were* decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans; just as European colonists were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria. (NOTE: The Khoi-San peoples are completely different from all other sub-Saharan African peoples.) So, I don't see what some of the other commentators are complaining about. The only thing *I* can find to complain about is that the series doesn't tell me anything I did not know by the time I finished seventh grade.

Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay. This hotel's five-star rating needs a downgrade! When I visited this hotel 14 years ago, The Fairmont was among the classiest brands. No more. My 29th floor room was expansive, but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working. The upholstery was frayed, the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water, and the room's door didn't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. Worse, the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you, with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. It was like sleeping in an old vending machine, but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message, there was none to be found. Other reviewers remarked that this hotel \\"needs updating,\\" but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame. For instance, someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations. I couldn't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space wouldn't accommodate my legs. (I am not unusually tall.)

Consider the agent's religion and lifestyle preferences.","completion":"Title: Choosing the Ideal Trust Agent: What to Consider Introduction In life, it is crucial to have someone you can trust to act on your behalf, make decisions for you, or share sensitive information with, especially during critical moments. This person, known as a trust agent, must possess certain characteristics and share similar values with you. Selecting the perfect trust agent requires profound consideration. This article presents a guide on factors to consider when choosing a trust agent, including age, health, location, religion, and lifestyle preferences. 1. Age of Your Trust Agent The first aspect to consider when choosing a trust agent is their age. Understandably, a younger person might be more agile and innovative, while an older individual might possess more experience and wisdom. Therefore, it is important to weigh these factors and choose an age range that best suits your needs and expectations. Try to select someone who not only possesses maturity but also has the potential to adapt to future changes. 2. Health of Your Trust Agent In addition to age, the health of your potential trust agent is another critical factor. Your trust agent must be physically and mentally able to handle any responsibilities and tasks assigned to them. An individual with good health will have fewer limitations in making decisions and fulfilling their role effectively. It is important to have an honest conversation about their health status, ensuring that they are committed to the long-term responsibilities of being a trust agent. 3. Location of Your Trust Agent Geographical proximity can impact the efficiency and effectiveness of a trust agent. Ideally, your trust agent should be located within accessible distance, allowing prompt communication and decision-making when necessary. In cases where long-distance communication is unavoidable, it is essential to establish a dependable line of communication, either through phone calls, emails or video conferences. 4. Religion and Cultural Background of Your Trust Agent Religion and cultural background play an essential role in shaping a person's values, beliefs, and decision-making process. It is crucial to choose a trust agent who shares your religious and cultural values to ensure that the decisions made on your behalf align with your beliefs. Discussing significant religious or cultural practices relevant to you and your trust agent will help create a strong foundation for a successful, understanding partnership. 5. Lifestyle Preferences of Your Trust Agent Finally, lifestyle preferences should be taken into consideration when selecting an ideal trust agent. These preferences include factors such as their personal habits, hobbies, financial management, and professional endeavors. By selecting someone with similar lifestyle preferences, you ensure they can understand and address your concerns with empathy and familiarity. This congruence of preferences will enable your trust agent to make decisions that genuinely reflect your desired outcomes. Conclusion Selecting the right trust agent is a process that involves an evaluation of age, health, location, religion, cultural background, and lifestyle preferences. By carefully considering these factors, you can identify the ideal individual who will diligently and faithfully perform their role on your behalf. Remember that honest and open communication is key for establishing mutual understanding and trust between you and your chosen trust agent."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In physics, energy is a property of objects which can be transferred to other objects or converted into different forms. The \\"ability of a system to perform work\\" is a common description, but it is difficult to give one single comprehensive definition of energy because of its many forms. For instance, in SI units, energy is measured in joules, and one joule is defined \\"mechanically\\", being the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.[note 1] However, there are many other definitions of energy, depending on the context, such as thermal energy, radiant energy, electromagnetic, nuclear, etc., where definitions are derived that are the most convenient. Common energy forms include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object's position in a force field (gravitational, electric or magnetic), the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects, the chemical energy released when a fuel burns, the radiant energy carried by light, and the thermal energy due to an object's temperature. All of the many forms of energy are convertible to other kinds of energy. In Newtonian physics, there is a universal law of conservation of energy which says that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed; however, it can change from one form to another.

The 19-year-old, who topped the podium on Wednesday night when he claimed the 1m title at the Royal Commonwealth Pool in Edinburgh, held a 13-point advantage heading into the last two dives. But he made a complete mess of his fifth dive, a forward four-and-a-half somersault, to gift the win to Ooi Tze Liang of Malaysia. Laugher’s final score of 449.70 left him 7.90 points behind Liang. Bronze went to his team-mate Oliver Dingley. “It hurts a bit but if you had told me four years ago I’d end up with a gold and a silver medal at a Commonwealth Games I would have said you were lying,” Laugher said.

The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system. - ELF Corporation ( or élf) was an eroge studio. One of its most popular games is \\"Dkysei\\", a pioneering dating sim, which has had a sequel, and been turned into video and TV series. The character design of the main villains from the \\"-saku\\" series is the company mascot. They are also known for role-playing video games such as the \\"Dragon Knight\\" series and visual novel adventure games such as \\"YU-NO\\". - Dragon Knight II (II) is a fantasy-themed eroge role-playing video game in the \\"Dragon Knight\\" franchise that was originally developed and published by ELF Corporation in 1990-1991 only in Japan as the first sequel to the original \\"Dragon Knight\\" from 1989. The game is an erotic dungeon crawler in which a young warrior Takeru fights to lift a witch's curse that has turned girls into monsters. - MSX is the name of a standardized home computer architecture, first announced by Microsoft on June 16, 1983, and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, then Vice-president at Microsoft Japan and Director at ASCII Corporation. Microsoft conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various hardware makers of the period. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. - An is a Japanese pornographic video game. History. Japanese eroge, also known as H-Light novels or hentai games, have their origins in the early 1980s, when Japanese companies introduced their own brands of microcomputer to compete with those of the United States. Competing systems included the Sharp X1, Fujitsu FM-7, MSX, and NEC PC-8801. NEC was behind its competitors in terms of hardware (with only 16 colors and no sound support) and needed a way to regain control of the market. Thus came the erotic game. The first commercial erotic computer game, \\"Night Life\\", was released by Koei in 1982. It was an early graphic adventure, with sexually explicit images. That same year, Koei released another erotic title, \\"Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku\\" (\\"Seduction of the Condominium Wife\\"), which was an early role-playing adventure game with colour graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the NEC PC-8001 computer. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company. - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation. - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - Koei Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game publisher, developer, and distributor founded in 1978. The company is known for its historical simulation games based on the novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", as well as simulation games based on pseudo-historical events. - FreeDOS (formerly Free-DOS and PD-DOS) is a free operating system for IBM PC compatible computers. It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems. - Knights of Xentar is an eroge role - playing video game published for the PC DOS in North America by Megatech Software in 1995 and has been originally published as Dragon Knight III in Japan in 1991 .

Answer the above question based on the context below: Aaliyah Dana Haughton was born on January 16, 1979, in Brooklyn, New York, and was the younger child of Diane and Michael \\"Miguel\\" Haughton (1951–2012). She was of African-American descent, and had Native American (Oneida) heritage from a grandmother. Her name has been described as a female version of the Arabic \\"Ali\\", but the original Jewish name \\"Aliya (Hebrew: אליה)\\" is derived from the Hebrew word \\"aliyah (Hebrew: עלייה)\\", meaning \\"highest, most exalted one, the best.\\" The singer was highly fond of her Semitic name, calling it \\"beautiful\\" and asserting she was \\"very proud of it\\" and strove to live up to her name every day. Aaliyah's mother enrolled Aaliyah in voice lessons at an early age. She started performing at weddings, church choir and charity events. When Aaliyah was five years old, her family moved to Detroit, Michigan, where she was reared along with her older brother, Rashad. She attended a Catholic school, Gesu Elementary, where in first grade she was cast in the stage play Annie, which inspired her to become an entertainer. In Detroit, her father began working in the warehouse business, one of his brother-in-law Barry Hankerson's widening interests. Her mother stayed home and raised Aaliyah and her brother.Throughout Aaliyah’s life, she had a good relationship with Rashad, who recalled Aaliyah having a beautiful voice as a child. Aaliyah's family was very close due to the struggles of her grandparents and when they moved to Detroit, the Hankersons were ready to take them in if necessary. These same bonds led to ties in the music industry, under the Blackground Records label.Aaliyah's mother was a vocalist, and her uncle, Barry Hankerson, was an entertainment lawyer who had been married to Gladys Knight. As a child, Aaliyah traveled with Knight and worked with an agent in New York to audition for commercials and television programs, including Family Matters; she went on to appear on Star Search at the age of ten.

What is the best way to: how to keep dates, from becoming gummy?","completion":"Keeping dates from becoming gummy requires proper storage techniques, as well as careful handling during preparation. Dates have a naturally sticky texture due to their high sugar content (glucose and fructose). While this is one of the main reasons for their popularity, it can also make them challenging to work with. Here are some practical tips to avoid gummy dates: 1. Select high-quality dates: When purchasing dates, look for firm, plump, and shiny ones. The skin should not be broken or have any visible signs of mold. If the dates are packaged, make sure the container is airtight and properly sealed. 2. Store dates correctly: To maintain their texture and prevent them from becoming gummy, it is essential to store dates in a cool, dry, and dark place. You can keep them in an airtight container or plastic bag to protect them from humidity, heat, and air exposure. If you live in a hot and humid climate, consider storing dates in the refrigerator to extend their shelf life. 3. Cut the dates right before using: To prevent excessive sticking and gumminess, cut the dates just before incorporating them into your recipes. This will help maintain their texture and minimize the stickiness. 4. Dust with flour: If you're using dates in a baked item or mixing them with other ingredients, try lightly dusting them with a little bit of flour before cutting or blending. The flour will absorb some of their moisture and help prevent them from sticking together or becoming gummy. 5. Use a sharp knife or kitchen scissors: When chopping or cutting dates, use a sharp knife or kitchen scissors to make clean, smooth cuts. This will prevent the dates from getting squished or compressed, which can result in a gummy texture. 6. Oil your knife or scissors: To minimize sticking, lightly coat the blade of your knife or the blades of your scissors with cooking oil or non-stick cooking spray. This will help the dates slide off the blade more easily and reduce gumminess. 7. Pulse in a food processor: If you're using a food processor to chop or blend dates, pulse the machine in short bursts instead of continuously running it. This will help maintain the structure of the dates, preventing them from becoming over-processed and gummy. 8. Separate the dates: When layering or incorporating chopped dates into a recipe, gently separate any clumps of dates stuck together to ensure even distribution and minimize gumminess. 9. Rehydrate dry dates: If you're working with overly dry dates, rehydrate them by soaking in warm water or juice for about 10-15 minutes. Drain well and pat dry before using. This will revitalize their texture and make them less likely to become gummy. 10. Practice patience: When handling dates, it's essential to work gently and patiently. Avoid applying excessive pressure and take the time to separate sticky pieces if necessary. By following these tips, you will be better equipped to prevent dates from becoming gummy, ensuring your recipes turn out delicious with just the right texture."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Here is a news article: CLEVELAND, Tennessee- A popular clothing choice for young girls and women was recently put in check by a Tennessee woman who wanted to lay down the proper rules when it comes to wearing leggings. Jamie Higdon Randolph from Cleveland, Tennessee recently posted a sassy video message to her Facebook page directed at women who like to wear ‘leggings.’ In her video titled, “Leggings ain’t pants,” Jamie said she was on her way to buy a new pair of leggings after she couldn’t find her own leggings and went to borrow a pair from her daughter. When Jamie realized those didn’t quite fit she left for the store to get herself a new pair and decided to share her thoughts about the popular fashion trend. “Ladies, it’s pretty much leggin’ weather,’ she says to start off her video. ‘I love leggin’ weather. I don’t care if you don’t like leggins, don’t judge me, they are comfortable. They don’t cut into you, they’re always the right length. You can dress them up, dress them down, you can look like a frat girl or you can look pretty classy in them depending on what you choose to pair with them.” Jamie went on to set the record straight when it comes to how the leg wear should be worn, “Some of you people like to use‪ leggins’ as britches, as pants, pants,” she says. “That’s not how they’re supposed to be worn. ‘If you can’t wear a shirt that covers your tail so that I can’t tell that you got some Aztec-print thongs on, you don’t need to be wearing ’em, [sic]” she said. Jamie added, if a pair of leggings are so tight that others can see tattoos through them, then they “shouldn’t be worn, period. That’s called pantyhose, honey.” She ended the video with a short summary- “Don’t do it.. You’re welcome!” The video has been viewed on Facebook more than 12 million times. ||||| Four years ago, fashion icon Tim Gunn scoffed when he was asked about the budding trend of people wearing leggings and yoga pants on the street. Nowadays, you can't stride down a sidewalk without seeing all kinds of athletic gear adorning people on their way to the pilates studio, grocery store, or work. Casual clothes have caught on. Heck, you can buy emoji-print leggings at Saks Fifth Avenue. So does Gunn still hate it when people wear those neon racerback tanks or jet black Spandex bottoms on the street? I get a deluge of sass when I ask him. \\"It's vulgar,\\" says Gunn. \\"Unless you're Robin Hood.\\" We're inside a tent in the shadow of New York's Flatiron Building for an event with Transitions, the lensmaker he has teamed up with. Ducking away from an endlessly refreshed meet-and-greet line, Gunn is fully buttoned-up, as usual; despite this September day's oppressive humidity, he's armored with a navy double-breasted suit. Gunn knows he's getting older, at 62, and he may sound stubborn, but he insists it's still important to present yourself respectably. Gym clothes won't do. \\"When did the leggings become a pant?\\" Gunn asks with an incredulous look. He wholly accepts stretchy leggings the way they were traditionally worn, as a layer underneath whatever else you're wearing. And they're fine while you're working out. Just change before you leave the gym. Comfort isn't an valid excuse, either, says Gunn. There are plenty of clothes you could wear that are cozy— say, a Diane von Furstenburg wrap dress, which has the stretch but remains sleek and chic. Unfortunately, the Project Runway mentor will probably be rolling his eyes for a while; it seems the torrent of Spandex isn't stopping soon. All kinds of fashion labels are now making activewear, hoping to ride the wave, from designer names like Stella McCartney and Tory Burch to such mass market tags as Old Navy and H&M. Activewear is even poking into the luxury realm, with new brands charging 400 or more for their leggings and yoga pants. It comes down to the occasion, Gunn says. Wear what's appropriate for what you're doing. Just as a swimsuit belongs at the pool or the beach, workout gear belongs at the gym, unless you're jogging down a sidewalk. Leggings as pants? You're basically wearing underwear, he says, and how does that make others perceive you? Even if you're just out running errands, what if you run into your boss, or an ex? \\"That's the thing about overly casual dressing,\\" says Gunn. \\"It says: 'I don't give a rat's ass about anything.'\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The news article discusses the opinions of two individuals, Jamie Higdon Randolph and Tim Gunn, who share concerns about wearing leggings as pants outside of a gym or exercise setting. Jamie Randolph, a Tennessee woman, posted a video on Facebook titled \\"Leggings ain't pants\\" that has been viewed over 12 million times. In the video, she humorously advises women not to wear leggings as pants if they cannot cover their behinds with a shirt, and if their leggings are tight enough to see tattoos through, they shouldn't be worn at all. Fashion icon Tim Gunn, formerly skeptical about the trend of wearing leggings and yoga pants on the street, maintains his dislike for it by describing it as \\"vulgar\\" in an interview. He also questions when leggings became considered pants and stresses the importance of presenting oneself respectably in public. According to Gunn, comfort is not a valid excuse for wearing leggings as pants, as there are many other comfortable clothing options like wrap dresses. Despite these opinions, it seems that the trend of wearing activewear as regular clothing will continue, with many fashion labels, including luxury brands, producing leggings and yoga pants. Gunn emphasizes that clothing should be appropriate for the occasion, and overly casual dressing may give off the impression that one does not care about anything.

Input: Passage: The Hotak dynasty was an Afghan monarchy of the Ghilji Pashtuns, established in April 1709 by Mirwais Hotak after leading a successful revolution against their declining Persian Safavid overlords in the region of Loy Kandahar in what is now southern Afghanistan. It lasted until 1738 when the founder of the Afsharid dynasty, Nader Shah Afshar, defeated Hussain Hotak during the long siege of Kandahar, and started the reestablishment of Iranian suzerainty over all regions lost decades before against the Iranian archrival, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire. At its peak, the Hotak dynasty ruled briefly over an area which is now Afghanistan, Iran, western Pakistan, and some parts of Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. In 1715, Mirwais died of a natural cause and his brother Abdul Aziz succeeded the monarchy. He was quickly followed by Mahmud who ruled the empire at its largest extent for a mere three years. Following the 1729 Battle of Damghan, where Ashraf Hotak was roundly defeated by Nader Shah, Ashraf was banished to what is now southern Afghanistan with Hotak rule being confined to it.

Two noteworthy wide receivers, Wes Welker and Benjamin Watson, have both displayed their skills on multiple occasions to lead their teams to victory. However, in a head-to-head comparison of their first half touchdown catches, the question arises: Whose catch was longer, Welker's or Watson's? Let's take an in-depth look at both of their significant touchdown catches to determine who comes out on top in this \\"battle of the beasts.\\" Wes Welker's First Half Touchdown Catch Wes Welker, a former American football wide receiver, played for several teams in the NFL, including the New England Patriots. Welker was known for his quickness and agility on the field, often making impressive and game-changing catches. One of Welker's notable first half touchdown catches occurred during the 2011 NFL season. Playing for the Patriots against the Miami Dolphins in Week 1, Welker's catch came to life in the second quarter. Quarterback Tom Brady threw a deep pass down the field, which was connected to Welker at about the Miami 20-yard line. With his impeccable ability to slip through the defense, Welker took the ball all the way to the end zone, scoring a touchdown for the team. This reception spanned a remarkable 99 yards, marking it as one of the longest touchdown catches in NFL history. Benjamin Watson's First Half Touchdown Catch Benjamin Watson, a former American football tight end, also made a name for himself as a reliable target for his quarterbacks and a skilled route-runner. Playing for several teams, including the New England Patriots and the New Orleans Saints, Watson exhibited his prowess as a top-tier tight end. One of Watson's memorable first half touchdown catches took place during the 2009 NFL season when he was playing for the New England Patriots. In a heated game against the Buffalo Bills, the first half was coming to a close as Watson took position. Watson found himself open in the middle of the field and received a pass from quarterback Tom Brady. With a swift move, Watson dodged defenders and sprinted toward the end zone, ultimately securing the touchdown. Watson's touchdown catch covered a distance of 36 yards, contributing significantly to the team's victory that day. The Verdict: Welker or Watson? After closely examining both Wes Welker's and Benjamin Watson's first half touchdown catches, it's clear that Welker's was the more impressive and longer reception. Spanning 99 yards, compared to Watson's 36-yard catch, Welker's touchdown not only displayed his world-class skills but also made history as one of the longest touchdown catches in the NFL. While both athletes have showcased their talents throughout their respective careers, it is Welker who earns the distinction of having the longer first half touchdown catch in this comparison."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs A:","completion":"The final step in the process after the bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs is the elimination of carbon dioxide from the body through exhalation. This step is crucial in maintaining the balance of gases within the body, ensuring that enough oxygen is supplied to the body while disposing of harmful waste gases like carbon dioxide. Here's a detailed explanation of the final step: 1. As the bloodstream transports carbon dioxide back to the lungs, it arrives in the pulmonary capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels surrounding the alveoli. The alveoli are minute air sacs within the lungs that facilitate gas exchange. 2. In the alveoli, the process of external respiration takes place, where the carbon dioxide brought by the blood diffuses from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli due to the concentration gradient between the blood and the alveolar air. Simultaneously, oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the pulmonary capillaries, again driven by the concentration gradient. 3. The carbon dioxide-rich air in the alveoli must now be exhaled. This occurs during the exhalation phase of the breathing cycle. The diaphragm, a large muscle located beneath the lungs, plays a major role in this process. During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes and moves upwards, leading to a decrease in the volume of the thoracic cavity. This causes an increase in the pressure within the thoracic cavity, which is now greater than the atmospheric pressure outside the body. 4. This pressure difference forces the carbon dioxide-rich air out of the alveoli and into the bronchioles, then the bronchi, and eventually into the trachea. The trachea is a large tube that connects the lungs to the larynx and pharynx, eventually leading to the oral and nasal cavities. 5. The carbon dioxide-rich air continues to be pushed out of the trachea and passes through the larynx. The larynx, or voice box, is responsible for producing sound, but during exhalation, the vocal cords within the larynx remain open to allow the air to pass through unrestricted. 6. The air then moves through the pharynx, a tube that connects the nasal cavity, oral cavity, and larynx. From the pharynx, the air is expelled out of the body either through the nostrils in the nasal cavity or the mouth in the oral cavity. In conclusion, the final step in the respiratory process, after the bloodstream carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs, is the elimination of carbon dioxide from the body through exhalation. This process is crucial in maintaining the balance of gases within the body and ensuring proper cellular function."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Huey Pierce Long Jr. (August 30, 1893 - September 10, 1935), self-nicknamed The Kingfish, was an American politician who served as the 40th governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932 and as a member of the United States Senate from 1932 until his assassination in 1935. As the political leader of Louisiana, he commanded wide networks of supporters and was willing to take forceful action. He established the long-term political prominence of the Long family. A Democrat and an outspoken populist, Long denounced the wealthy elites and the banks. By 1935, Long's most recent consolidation of personal power led to talk of armed opposition from his enemies. Opponents increasingly invoked the memory of the Battle of Liberty Place of 1874, in which the White League staged an uprising against Louisiana's Reconstruction-era government. In January 1935, an anti-Long paramilitary organization called the Square Deal Association was formed. Its members included former governors John M. Parker and Ruffin G. Pleasant and New Orleans Mayor T. Semmes Walmsley. On January 25, 200 armed Square Dealers took over the courthouse of East Baton Rouge Parish. Long had Governor Allen call out the National Guard, declare martial law, ban public gatherings of two or more persons, and forbid the publication of criticism of state officials. The Square Dealers left the courthouse, but there was a brief armed skirmish at the Baton Rouge Airport. Tear gas and live ammunition were fired; one person was wounded but there were no fatalities. In the summer of 1935, Long called for two more special sessions of the legislature; bills were passed in rapid-fire succession without being read or discussed. The new laws further centralized Long's control over the state by creating several new Long-appointed state agencies: a state bond and tax board holding sole authority to approve all loans to parish and municipal governments, a new state printing board which could withhold \\"official printer\\" status from uncooperative newspapers, a new board of election supervisors which would appoint all poll watchers, and a State Board of Censors. They also stripped away the remaining lucrative powers of the mayor of New Orleans to cripple the entrenched opposition. Long boasted that he had \\"taken over every board and commission in New Orleans except the Community Chest and the Red Cross.\\" Long quarreled with former State Senator Henry E. Hardtner of La Salle Parish. While proceeding to Baton Rouge in August 1935 to confront the state government over a tax matter relating to his Urania Lumber Company, based in Urania, Hardtner, known as \\"the father of forestry in the South,\\" was killed in a car-train accident.

You also can’t use water to clean most stains. You must use a soft brush to gently rub away the dirt. You can buy a suede brush, which can be found at most major retailers, shoe shops, or online. If you don’t have a suede brush, try a soft nylon brush. A brush used for nails could work. A soft cloth can also work if you don’t have a brush. Just make sure the brush is not too hard. To start cleaning, use the brush to brush away any dirt and stains. This gets all the dirt from the surface of the shoe. When first brushing, make sure you brush in the same direction. This helps remove anything on the surface. This works for mud and other basic stains. After you’ve brushed all the dirt off the surface, use the brush to rub with slightly more pressure. Brush back and forth over the stain to try to remove the dirt that is deeper in the suede. Make sure to still only use moderate pressure. Suede is delicate, so if you brush it too hard, you can damage it. After you have cleaned your shoes, consider spraying them with black suede protector. This product will help keep your shoes from getting too many surface stains, though it won’t protect from everything. Black suede protector has dye in it to help maintain the black color of your shoes. You can also buy plain spray suede protector if you don't want to use a dye one.

Second question: How is Bolivia's geographical location unique in the region, and how does its geography compare to that of other countries? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First, let us address the two questions you've asked. Question 1: How is Bolivia's geographical location unique in the region, and how does its geography compare to Colombia's? Question 2: How is Bolivia's geographical location unique in the region, and how does its geography compare to that of other countries? While both questions focus on Bolivia's unique geographical location, the first question specifically seeks a comparison with Colombia, whereas the second question is open to comparison with any country. Thus, although similar in intent, these questions are not exactly the same. Now, let's provide detailed answers to both questions. Question 1: Bolivia's geographical location is unique in the region for several reasons. Located in western-central South America, Bolivia is a landlocked country, bordered by Brazil to the north and east, Paraguay and Argentina to the south, and Chile and Peru to the west. In contrast to other South American nations, Bolivia lacks direct access to the ocean, which has had a profound impact on the country's development, trade, and relations with neighboring countries. Bolivia's geography can primarily be divided into three regions: the Andean region, which includes the Altiplano plateau and the Cordillera mountain ranges; the Sub-Andean region or Yungas, which is a transition zone between the Altiplano and the Amazon rainforest; and the Llanos, or lowlands, which consist of the Gran Chaco and the Amazon Basin. Comparing Bolivia's geography to Colombia's, several differences stand out. Colombia is located in the northwest of South America, with coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Its geography is characterized by four main regions: the Andean highlands, the Caribbean coastal lowlands, the Pacific coastal lowlands, and the Eastern Llanos. While both countries share the Andean mountain range, Bolivia's Altiplano plateau is unique, being the world's second-highest plateau after Tibet. Additionally, Colombia experiences greater biodiversity due to its two coastlines and the country's proximity to the equator. Question 2: To address how Bolivia's geographical location is unique in the region and how its geography compares to that of other countries, we'll focus on two key aspects: its landlocked nature and its diverse topography. As mentioned earlier, Bolivia is a landlocked country, one of only two in South America (the other being Paraguay). This absence of a coastline presents distinct economic challenges and makes the country more reliant on its neighbors for maritime access. Around the world, other landlocked countries, such as Austria, Switzerland, Kazakhstan, or Uganda, face similar issues. Each of these countries has its own distinct topography and geopolitical situation, which, combined with their lack of coastline, contributes to the uniqueness of their geography. In terms of diverse topography, Bolivia boasts an array of distinct environments, including high plateaus, mountain ranges, and lowland plains. This broad spectrum is exemplary of the diversity seen in other geographically diverse countries—such as the United States, which spans arid deserts, towering mountains, fertile plains, and vast coastlines, or India, with its range of landscapes that stretch from the Himalayan peaks to tropical forests and coastal regions. In conclusion, while the two questions are similar in theme, they ask for different comparisons. Bolivia's geography has several unique features, notably its landlocked position and diverse landscapes. When comparing Bolivia to Colombia or other geographically diverse countries around the world, these unique aspects help to highlight the country's distinct position within South America and globally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person that notes the large amount of locales in the opera written by the man who had practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man? In the view of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main influences were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes – in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him \\"one of the loudest of modern composers\\" – much of his music is soft and delicate. Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side \\"is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in Werther), theatrical action (as in Thérèse), scenic diversion (as in Esclarmonde), or humour (as in Le portrait de Manon).\\"Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists a great number of locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices. Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person that notes the large amount of locales in the opera written by the man who had practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man is Macdonald.

President Barack Obama, speaking early Wednesday in Afghanistan at the tail end of a surprise visit there, discussed how the war will end and promised a steady drawdown of U.S. troops. Obama committed to pulling 23,000 troops out of the country by the end of summer and sticking to the 2014 deadline to turn security fully over to the Afghan government. He said that NATO will set a goal this month for Afghan forces to be in the lead for combat operations next year. \\"We will not build permanent bases in this country, nor will we be patrolling its cities and mountains. That will be the job of the Afghan people,\\" the president said during a speech at Bagram Air Base. Read extensive excerpts of the speech. His unannounced trip was Obama's third visit to Afghanistan since taking office. It coincided with the first anniversary of the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden in neighboring Pakistan, and comes as Obama is fighting for re-election. Hours after Obama left the country, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force reported a loud explosion in the capital, Kabul. Gen. Mohammad Ayoub Salangi, Kabul chief of police, told CNN it was a suicide car bomb. The blast killed five people outside a compound known as Green Village, according Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for Afghan Interior Ministry. An undetermined number of others also were injured. The president promised not to keep troops in harm's way \\"a single day longer than is absolutely required for our national security,\\" but promised to \\"finish the job\\" and \\"end this war responsibly.\\" Obama spoke of a \\"negotiated peace,\\" and said his administration has been in direct talks with the Taliban. \\"We've made it clear that they can be a part of this future if they break with al Qaeda, renounce violence, and abide by Afghan laws,\\" he said. Finally, the president vowed: \\"This time of war began in Afghanistan, and this is where it will end.\\" Earlier in his trip, Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai signed an agreement outlining cooperation between their countries once the U.S.-led international force withdraws in 2014. Some U.S. forces will remain in a post-war Afghanistan as military advisers, but both U.S. and Afghan officials have yet to decide how many troops will continue supporting the Afghan military, and for how long. See reactions to Obama's surprise trip. At a signing ceremony for the Strategic Partnership Agreement, Obama said that neither country asked for the war that began more than a decade ago, but now they would work in partnership for a peaceful future. \\"There will be difficult days ahead, but as we move forward in our transition, I'm confident that Afghan forces will grow stronger; the Afghan people will take control of their future,\\" Obama said. Addressing a concern in Afghanistan that the United States will abandon the country once its troops leave, Obama said, \\"With this agreement, I am confident that the Afghan people will understand that the United States will stand by them.\\" He later added that the United States \\"did not come here to claim resources or to claim territory. We came here with a very clear mission to destroy al Qaeda,\\" referring to the terrorist organization responsible for the September 11, 2001, attacks. Obama's address came nine years to the day after then-President George W. Bush delivered his \\"Mission Accomplished\\" speech aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, announcing the end of major combat operations in Iraq. Karzai offered his thanks to the American people for helping Afghanistan, and the presidents shook hands after signing the document in the atrium of the King's Residence, part of the Presidential Palace in Kabul. \\"This agreement will close the season of the past 10 years and is going to open an equal relationship season. With the signing of this agreement, we are starting a phase between two sovereign and independent countries that will be based on mutual respect, mutual commitments and mutual friendship,\\" Karzai said. Obama warned the Afghan people and, later, U.S. troops he met with, of difficult days ahead. In remarks to troops at Bagram, Obama sounded emotional as he said that soldiers could see friends get hurt or killed as the mission winds down. \\"There's going to heartbreak and pain and difficulty ahead, but there's a light on the horizon because of the sacrifices you've made,\\" he said. The security risks in Afghanistan were evident from the secretive nature and timing of the trip. Obama landed in Afghanistan in the cover of darkness, and the signing ceremony occurred in the late evening. Back in the United States, politicians reacted to the president's visit -- some with praise, others claiming it was politically motivated. Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said, \\"I am pleased that President Obama has returned to Afghanistan. Our troops and the American people deserve to hear from our president about what is at stake in this war. Success in Afghanistan is vital to our nation's security. It would be a tragedy for Afghanistan and a strategic setback for America if the Taliban returned to power and once again created a sanctuary for terrorists.\\" Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, was less supportive. \\"Clearly, this trip is campaign-related. We've seen recently that President Obama has visited college campuses in an attempt to win back the support of that age group since he has lost it over the last three years. Similarly, this trip to Afghanistan is an attempt to shore up his national security credentials, because he has spent the past three years gutting our military,\\" he said in a statement. The Strategic Partnership Agreement provides a framework for the U.S.-Afghanistan partnership for the decade after the U.S. and allied troop withdrawal, according to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the flight. Specific levels of U.S. forces and funding are not set in the agreement and will be determined by the United States in consultation with allies, the officials said on condition of not being identified. Noting the anniversary of the bin Laden mission, the officials called it a resonant day for the Afghan and American people. More than 130,000 troops from 50 countries serve in Afghanistan, according to the NATO-led International Security and Assistance Force. The United States is the biggest contributor, providing about 90,000 troops, followed by the United Kingdom (9,500), Germany (4,800) and France (3,600). The war that began in 2001 is increasingly unpopular in the United States, with the latest CNN/ORC International poll in late March showing 25% of respondents supporting it and 72% opposing it. More than 2,700 troops from the United States and its partners have died in the war, the majority of them American. In 2011, the United States outlined its plan to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. The move was followed by withdrawal announcements by most of the NATO nations. Last week, Afghan National Security Adviser Rangin Daftar Spanta and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker initialed a text that outlined the kind of relationship the two countries want in the decade following the NATO withdrawal. The deal had been long expected after Washington and Kabul found compromises over the thorny issues of \\"night raids\\" by U.S. forces on Afghan homes and the transfer of U.S. detainees to Afghan custody. It seeks to create an enduring partnership that prevents the Taliban from waiting until the U.S. withdrawal to try to regain power, the senior administration officials said. Obama visited Afghanistan in March 2010 and returned in December of the same year. He also visited Afghanistan in 2008 as a presidential candidate. CNN's Tom Cohen, Barbara Starr, Keating Holland, Nick Paton Walsh and journalist Masoud Popalzai contributed to this report.

Choose the best option from the 5 given options and report that option. Q: Question: A bag contains 7 green and 8 white balls. If two balls are drawn simultaneously, the probability that both are of the same colour iS? Option A: 7/15 Option B: 7/16 Option C: 7/143 Option D: 7/18 Option E: 7/11 A:","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of drawing two green balls or two white balls. We can do this using the concepts of probability and combinatorics. First, let's find the total number of possible ways to draw two balls simultaneously. The total is given by the combinations formula, C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) Here, n = total number of balls (7 green + 8 white = 15 balls), and k = 2 (since we are drawing two balls). So, C(15, 2) = 15! / (2! * 13!) = (15 * 14) / (2 * 1) = 105 possible ways. Now we need to calculate the two possible favorable outcomes: 1. Drawing two green balls: There are 7 green balls, so the number of ways to do this is C(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * 5!) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) = 21 ways. 2. Drawing two white balls: There are 8 white balls, so the number of ways to do this is C(8, 2)= 8! / (2! * 6!) = (8 * 7) / (2 * 1) = 28 ways. Now we add the number of favorable outcomes (21 + 28 = 49) and divide by the total number of possible ways (105) to find the probability: Probability = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes = 49 / 105 To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 49 and 105, which is 7. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD, we get: 49 / 7 = 7 and 105 / 7 = 15 So, the probability is 7/15.

They both inquire about a particular song that gives you goosebumps when you hear it. However, there is a slight difference in the way they are phrased. Question 1: \\"What is that song which gives you goosebumps?\\" This question is phrased more like a straightforward inquiry about a song that often causes goosebumps. The question assumes that there is one specific song that has this effect on the person being asked and that the song may be more or less consistent. Question 2: \\"Which song gives you goosebumps when you hear it every time? Why?\\" This question is asking not only about a song that causes goosebumps but also expresses interest in understanding the specific reasons for that emotional reaction. By including the phrase \\"every time\\" and asking \\"why,\\" the question delves deeper into the consistency of the impact of the song on the person and the underlying reasons behind the powerful emotional response. In conclusion, although the two questions are quite similar in nature, they vary slightly in their focus and emphasis.

Premise: Like Mark Twain, who said that suicide is the only sane thing the young or old ever do in this life, we imagine that the elderly and the ill desire death rationally. Hypothesis: There is no sanity to be found in thoughts of suicide. Step 2: Analyze the premise. The premise suggests that suicide could be considered a sane act for the elderly and the ill as they might rationally desire death. It refers to a statement made by Mark Twain, implying that these thoughts are not signs of insanity. Step 3: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis asserts that there is no sanity in thoughts of suicide, implying that considering suicide is inherently an insane or irrational action. Step 4: Compare the premise and the hypothesis. The premise posits that suicide might be a rational decision for certain individuals (the elderly and the ill). On the other hand, the hypothesis argues that suicidal thoughts are inherently irrational and not sane. Step 5: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. In this case, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise and the hypothesis present contrasting viewpoints on the rationale behind suicidal thoughts, with the premise suggesting that it might be a sane decision under certain circumstances and the hypothesis claiming that it is always irrational.

It actually pretty much tasted like a REALLY good plate of friend noodles , instead of maggie goreng . So no complaints ! ! ! Plus , it was really spicy as well . Answer the following question: Why was the speaker so satisfied with the dish ?","completion":"The speaker was highly satisfied with the dish for several reasons, as described in their statement. Analyzing the key elements of their experience, we can identify the following factors contributing to their satisfaction: 1. Taste: The speaker mentions that the dish tasted like a \\"REALLY good plate of friend noodles\\" instead of maggie goreng. This suggests that the dish exceeded their expectations and was better than a mere regular maggie goreng. The fact that they emphasized the taste being \\"REALLY good\\" indicates that the dish left a strong and positive impression on them. It is possible that the unique flavors, seasonings, or preparation methods used in the dish resulted in a delectable experience for the speaker. 2. Comparison to friend noodles: By comparing the dish to a plate of friend noodles, the speaker is likely highlighting two key aspects – the texture and overall experience. Friend noodles are often known for their delicious and satisfying textures, which can range from being crispy on the outside to tender on the inside. Additionally, the friend noodle dish might have a rich, savory taste, which further enhanced the overall enjoyment of the dish for the speaker. On the other hand, maggie goreng could be perceived as a more basic or familiar dish for the speaker. Therefore, the unexpected similarity to a highly favored dish (friend noodles) contributed to the speaker's satisfaction. 3. Spiciness: The speaker also points out that the dish was \\"really spicy.\\" Spiciness is often an essential factor in the enjoyment of certain dishes, particularly in cuisines that highly value the heat brought on by spices and chilies. For those who prefer spicy dishes, the intensity of the spices can heighten their overall culinary experience. If the spiciness was within the speaker's preference range, it would have only added to their satisfaction. 4. No complaints: The speaker explicitly states that they have \\"no complaints.\\" This implies that the dish not only met but exceeded their expectations. They may have been pleasantly surprised by the dish's flavors, textures, spiciness, and overall presentation, leading to a highly satisfying experience. It also suggests that there were no apparent downsides or negatives to the dish, leaving the speaker with a positive memory of their experience. In conclusion, the speaker was so satisfied with the dish because it surpassed their expectations in terms of taste, provided a delightful texture that resembled a favorite dish (friend noodles), and offered the right level of spiciness that catered to their preference. The combination of these factors resulted in an enjoyable culinary experience that left the speaker without any complaints."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The abolition of tuition fees certainly set Scotland on a different path, and the monument has locked the SNP into its flagship policy. There's no doubt it has saved hundreds of thousands of students from repaying debts out of their graduate salaries. But, as a detailed analysis published today shows, there is little evidence it has propelled many more working class Scottish students into university. The research was commissioned by the Sutton Trust in England, which has long scrutinised social mobility. In itself, that raises interesting questions about why this kind of work is not being funded within Scotland. The research, compiled by academics from the University of Edinburgh, points out that middle-class Scottish students leave university with less debt than any group in the UK. They do not pay tuition fees, and unlike the poorest students, it's the bank of mum and dad that's likely to pick up the costs of rent, food, books and bills. Not surprisingly it seems to have been a popular policy. But most of the progress in helping poorer students into higher studies in Scotland has been in Further Education colleges. Some transfer to university, but quite often have to repeat a year, suggesting it's not an easy experience. And pressure will build in the system as the number of total number of university places is limited by government. Today's report warns that it's the disadvantaged that lose out most from that limit - when competition for places is stiff, middle-class elbows tend to be sharper. The wealthiest students in Scotland are four times more likely to go straight to university than those from the poorest families. It's a gap that is bigger than any other part of the UK. There has been a scheme to ring-fence some places at elite Scottish universities for poorer students, which has been successful. That comes to an end this year, with the places being absorbed into the total, as agreed at the outset with the government. Last autumn, the Commission on Widening Access in Scotland warned the inequality in universities was \\"unfair, damaging and unsustainable\\". The Scottish government has accepted something needs to be done. Plans for a Commissioner for Fair Access are expected soon with details of how universities can be held to account. Of course without a further increase in the number of places letting more disadvantaged students in can only come at the expense of the better off. No wonder the National Union of Students is calling for more places, and in Scotland that could only be done by more direct funding. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The abolition of tuition fees in Scotland has not significantly increased the number of working-class students attending university, according to a detailed analysis by the Sutton Trust. The research shows that middle-class Scottish students leave university with the least debt of any group in the UK, as their families often cover additional costs. Most of the progress in supporting poorer students has occurred in Further Education colleges, which offer limited opportunities for transferring to university. The report claims that disadvantaged students are disproportionately affected by a government limit on the number of university places available."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The War on Kids Movie plot: Blame for problems with schooling in America is often assigned to insufficient funding or the inherent failings of today's kids. In rare cases, parents, teachers, and administrators are also implicated. However, all efforts to improve the quality of education are doomed to fail if the system itself is not examined and understood to be the most significant impediment. After over six years in the making, THE WAR ON KIDS reveals that the problems with public education ultimately stem from the institution itself. Astonishingly all efforts at reform consistently avoid even considering this to be a possibility and the future for children and American democracy are at stake.In 95 minutes, THE WAR ON KIDS exposes the many ways the public school system has failed children and our future by robbing students of all freedoms due largely to irrational fears. Children are subjected to endure prison-like security, arbitrary punishments, and pharmacological abuse through the forced prescription of dangerous drugs. Even with these measures, schools not only fail to educate students, but the drive to teach has become secondary to the need to control children.THE WAR ON KIDS begins with the history of Zero Tolerance policy. In the 1990s, almost all schools began instituting guidelines that were originally designed to keep weapons and drugs off campus. Very quickly, school officials began to arbitrarily decide what should be considered a weapon and what should be considered a drug. Hundreds of situations followed where children were (and continue to be) suspended or expelled for possessing food knives, nail clippers, key chains, chicken strips, aspirin, and candy. Kindergarteners were even suspended for playing cops and robbers and using their fingers as guns. Under the guise of Zero Tolerance, administrators have been able to wield tremendous power without the burden of responsibility and this authority continues to be increasingly abused. Students invariably feel despondent and fearful in the Kafka-esque state that has been...

The answer to the question: Who later expanded their original idea to include a third opera with mystic or religious tones? is inside the article: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's..., can you guess it ?

Article: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to supporters at her election night watch party after winning the South Carolina Democratic primary in Columbia, S.C., Saturday, Feb. 27, 2016.... (Associated Press) Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to supporters at her election night watch party after winning the South Carolina Democratic primary in Columbia, S.C., Saturday, Feb. 27, 2016. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Hillary Clinton won the support of an overwhelming majority of black voters, large majorities of men and women, and even a majority of voters under 45 on her way to a claiming a commanding victory in South Carolina's Democratic primary Saturday. There were few bright spots for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to the exit poll conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. What the exit poll found: ___ BLACK VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY FOR CLINTON About 6 in 10 voters in South Carolina's Democratic primary were black, by far the largest proportion of African-Americans in any of the contests so far. And nearly 9 in 10 black voters supported Clinton. White voters were more closely divided between Clinton and Sanders. Black primary voters were more likely to say they trust Clinton over Sanders to handle race relations, with more than 4 in 10 saying they only trust her and less than 1 in 10 saying they only trust him. Just over 4 in 10 said they trust both. Among all primary voters Saturday — black and white — 8 in 10 said the issue of race relations was important to their vote. Among black primary voters, a third said it was the most important issue to them. ___ YOUNGER WOMEN FLIP TO CLINTON Six in 10 South Carolina primary voters were women, and 8 in 10 of them said they voted for Clinton. She was also supported by about 7 in 10 men. Six in 10 white women supported Clinton, while a majority of white men said they voted for Sanders. Clinton ate into Sanders' advantage among young voters. Although he was supported by a slim majority of primary voters under 30, she was supported by about three-quarters of those between the ages of 30 and 44, as well as 8 in 10 of those 45 and older. Clinton won a majority of women under 45, a group that backed Sanders in the previous contests. This time around, they divided the vote among women under 30, but 8 in 10 of those between age 30 and 44 said they voted for Clinton. Two-thirds of white voters under 45 supported Sanders, but among blacks, that group went overwhelmingly for Clinton. Clinton won the support of majorities of liberals, moderates and conservatives in Saturday's contest. Eight in 10 primary voters said they were Democrats, and 8 in 10 of them were Clinton voters. Among independents, a slim majority backed Sanders. ___ WHAT HONESTY PROBLEM? Clinton was supported by over 9 in 10 voters saying experience was the most important quality in choosing a candidate, and 8 in 10 of those said it was most important to choose a candidate who can win in November. She was also supported by 7 in 10 voters saying they want a candidate who cares about people like them. Among those looking for a candidate who is honest and trustworthy, Sanders and Clinton split the vote. Democrats looking for a candidate who cares about people like them or one who is honest and trustworthy overwhelmingly supported Sanders in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. In South Carolina, he was still supported by majorities of white voters who cared most about a candidate being honest or caring about people like them. Questions about Clinton's honesty have dogged her throughout the campaign and appeared to be a weakness in earlier contests. But in South Carolina, three-quarters of voters said Clinton is honest, more than the two-thirds who said the same of Sanders. ___ CLINTON TRUSTED ON FOREIGN POLICY More than half of voters said they trust only Clinton — not Sanders — to handle an international crisis, while another third of voters said they trust both of them. Less than 1 in 10 said they trust Sanders over Clinton. Clinton won majorities of voters saying they think the economy, health care or terrorism are the most important issue facing the country, and she even led among those saying income inequality is most important. More than 4 in 10 South Carolina primary voters said the economy is the most important issue, more than in any other state so far. ___ EXPERIENCE AND CONTINUITY Three-quarters of voters said they want the next president to generally continue President Barack Obama's policies, while just 2 in 10 want the next president's policies to be more liberal. Clinton was supported by 8 in 10 of those wanting a continuation of Obama's policies, while Sanders was supported by a majority of those wanting more liberal policies. Nearly 9 in 10 primary voters Saturday said they prefer a candidate with political experience to an outsider, and 8 in 10 of those voters said they supported Clinton. ___ The survey was conducted for The Associated Press and the television networks by Edison Research as Democratic voters left their polling places at 30 randomly selected sites in South Carolina. The preliminary results include interviews with 1,461 Democratic primary voters and have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. ___ Follow Emily Swanson on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/EL_Swan ||||| A woman listens to Hillary Clinton speak at a Feb. 26 \\"Get Out The Vote\\" rally for historically black colleges and universities, at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, South Carolina. | AP Photo Black voters reject Bernie Sanders in South Carolina The primary results bode poorly for the senator heading into Super Tuesday. South Carolina's black Democrats really do not like Bernie Sanders. Not only did the Vermont senator get shellacked by Hillary Clinton in the overall vote in South Carolina's primary, his share of the African-American electorate was worse here than in Nevada. Story Continued Below According to exit polls, Clinton won black voters 86 percent to Sanders' 14 percent, a decline from his already poor performance with this critical demographic group last week in Nevada, where he secured 22 percent of the black vote. For Sanders, it's an ominous reflection of Clinton's momentum heading into Super Tuesday. “If he’s going to win this nomination he’s got to figure how he’s going to appeal to a much broader audience because right now he is struggling and he’s heading into a set of primaries in states where they don’t look anything like New Hampshire,” said Doug Thornell, a Democratic strategist and former communications director for the Congressional Black Caucus. “He’s got to figure out a way to tweak his message and I think in many ways he’s got to almost overhaul it because he’s been able to energize a lot of Democrats who feel angry about the political process, but I don’t think Sanders acknowledged strongly enough the progress that president Obama has made.” Since being ambushed by Black Lives Matters supporters in the summer of 2015, Sanders has expanded his policy focus to criminal justice reform and poverty in minority communities while sending African-American surrogates to key states. But, so far, for naught and the next few states on the Democratic primary calendar won't be any easier for Sanders. A survey by the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling shows that the higher the chunk of black voters in the Democratic primary, the worse Sanders does. In Mississippi, where the black vote is 37 percent of the Democratic electorate, Clinton leads Sanders 60 percent to 26 percent. In Louisiana, where the group accounts for 32 percent of Democratic voters, Clinton wins the same share. \\"I think how goes South Carolina, and I've said this...there goes America,\\" said Rick Wade, Obama's 2008 African-American outreach director who recently endorsed Clinton. \\"This is a better reflection of what America looks like so you cannot win without the component of black voters in your coalition. You got to have it. And I think Hillary's demonstrated tonight that she has that coalition.\\" Clinton was buoyed in South Carolina by strong ties to national figures in the black community, such as Rep. Jim Clyburn. And during her victory speech on Saturday night, she name-checking Clyburn but also hit on issues important to the black community, citing Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland before pointing to Flint, Michigan's water crisis as she began to pivot to the general election against the Republican nominee. \\"By now we all know the story of Flint, Michigan, how a city's children were poisoned by toxic water because their state's governor wanted to save a little money,\\" Clinton said. Sanders, just minutes after the South Carolina primary was called, released a statement, conceding to Clinton in the primary. He thanked six black state representatives in South Carolina who supported him but otherwise made no mention of the black vote. \\"Let me be clear on one thing tonight. This campaign is just beginning. We won a decisive victory in New Hampshire. She won a decisive victory in South Carolina,\\" Sanders said in the statement. \\"Now it’s on to Super Tuesday. In just three days, Democrats in 11 states will pick 10 times more pledged delegates on one day than were selected in the four early states so far in this campaign. Our grassroots political revolution is growing state by state, and we won't stop now.\\" ||||| Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign has always known that it needs to play catch-up with black voters if it's going to win the Democratic primary. South Carolina was Sanders's first big chance to show he could make inroads with this group, and it looks like he completely and utterly failed. Clinton winning black voters 84-16, bigger margin than Obama in 2008, when he won 78-19 — Martin Gelin (@M_Gelin) February 28, 2016 That is, needless to say, very bad news for Sanders. And if he can't change those numbers, it's going to be a huge problem for him throughout the South as well as in several Northern states like Maryland, Delaware, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey. But beyond the primary math, it raises a kind of conceptual issue about Sanders's political theory: Given the centrality of African-American voters to the Democratic Party, it's hard to envision a left-wing political revolution taking place in the United States that they have so little enthusiasm for. |||||Summary:","completion":"Hillary Clinton participated in an election and won in South Carolina. In this election, she was competing against another person named Bernie Sanders to see who would be the favorite for the group called the Democratic Party. The people in South Carolina chose who they liked the most by voting, and Hillary Clinton got more votes than Bernie Sanders. Hillary Clinton was very popular with black voters; that means those voters liked her more than Bernie Sanders. When you win or lose an election, it usually teaches you a lesson, and for Bernie Sanders, he needs to find ways to make more people like him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which Persian king released the Hebrews from Babylon?","completion":"Cyrus the Great, also known as Cyrus II of Persia, was the Persian king who released the Hebrews from Babylon. He was the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, which at its greatest extent covered much of Southwest Asia, Central Asia, and the European territories of the former Eastern Mediterranean. Cyrus the Great came to power in 559 BC, and his reign lasted until his death in 530 BC. He was a successful military leader, and his conquests led to the establishment of one of the most extensive empires in history. In 539 BC, Cyrus conquered Babylon, which was the center of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. This empire was responsible for the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC and the subsequent captivity and forced exile of many Hebrew people. Upon the conquest of Babylon, Cyrus issued the Cyrus Cylinder, a royal edict that declared religious tolerance and human rights for the diverse peoples within his empire. This ancient clay cylinder, inscribed in Akkadian cuneiform script, records the restoration of several temples and the return of displaced communities to their homelands. According to the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the books of Ezra and 2 Chronicles, Cyrus allowed the Hebrew exiles to return to their homeland and rebuild their temple in Jerusalem. This decision to release the Hebrews from captivity and permit them to return to their homeland was a significant act of benevolence, as it demonstrated his dedication to religious tolerance and the rights of conquered people to practice their faith and customs. Cyrus's policy of respecting religious and cultural freedoms within his empire helped foster stability and harmony among the diverse populations that the Achaemenid Empire ruled. This has earned him a well-respected reputation in both Jewish and Persian histories, as well as in the broader context of ancient Near Eastern history. In conclusion, the Persian king Cyrus the Great released the Hebrews from Babylon during his conquest of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC. Through his edict, the Cyrus Cylinder, he implemented policies of religious tolerance and human rights within his empire, enabling the displaced Hebrews to return to Jerusalem and reconstruct their temple. As a result, Cyrus earned a special place in the Hebrew Bible and has been widely celebrated for his magnanimity and wisdom."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was also nominated at the 2007 Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, and was platinum certified for shipping over 1,000,000 records. In 2006, Sanjiv Bhattacharya interviewed the duo for The Guardian and asked about where their band name came from, to which Green replied: \\"You ask me why we're called Gnarls Barkley and I'm asking you 'why not?'...The name Gnarls Barkley isn't anchored down. It's a drifter. A High Plains drifter, I might add\\". Danger Mouse said: \\"There's no story behind it...The name doesn't have anything to do with anything\\". Although many people believe that their name has something to do with former NBA player Charles Barkley, the duo dismiss that idea. Sanjiv asked them about it, saying \\"Not even Charles Barkley, the basketball player?\\", to which Danger Mouse replied: \\"Nope. It's just like everything else on this record. There was no conscious decision about stuff\\". According to a Billboard article: \\"Burton and CeeLo have been cagey about what the name of the act means, and each live performance is an opportunity to play dress-up as tennis players, astronauts and chefs, among many other get-ups. The costuming extends to photo shoots, as Burton and Cee Lo would rather impersonate characters from such films as Back to the Future or Wayne's World. They also have dressed up as characters from films A Clockwork Orange and Napoleon Dynamite. About Gnarls Barkley, Green said in an interview: That is that electric industrial Euro soul, that's what I call it... if I can call it anything. It truly is shapeless and formless. My style and my approach is still water, and it runs so deep. So, with that project I got a chance to be a lil' zany, of course a continuation of eccentricity, abstract and vague, and all of those wonderful things that make art exactly what it is. And that's subject to interpretation. As far as the artiste himself, it does cater to and extend the legacy of Cee Lo Green, and showcase the diversity and range and intention of Cee Lo Green. It is a great project that I'm very, very proud of.

Question: Who died in the accident? Movie plot title: Rails & Ties Movie plot: Laura Danner is a mentally ill, single mother who takes illegal drugs and is unable to care for her 10-year-old son Davey. Driven to despair, she decides to commit suicide by driving a car on to a railway track, taking Davey with her. She offers him some tranquillisers beforehand but, unbeknownst to her, he spits them out. His mother drives on to the tracks. As a train approaches, Davey tries in vain to drag her out of the car, himself jumping clear just in time. Two train crewmen, Tom Stark and Otis Higgs, seeing the car on the tracks ahead, argue about whether an emergency stop will derail the train or not. However, the train hits and kills the boy's mother. Subsequently, the railroad company calls for an internal inquiry and suspends the two drivers. Davey has spent the first night after the incident with an empathetic social worker, Susan Garcia. However, she places the boy with a cold-hearted, disciplinarian foster mother. Later on, after being confined to his room, he escapes by shattering the window. The authorities are alerted and a missing persons search is initiated. The boy obtains train conductor Tom Stark's home address. He turns up at the Starks' home and berates Tom for accidentally killing his mother in the train crash, but eventually he is placated. Tom's wife Megan insists on letting the boy stay although Tom initially disapproves. Caring for Davey gradually helps the couple rebond with each other. Megan is suffering from breast cancer. Having already undergone a mastectomy, she has decided that she will no longer endure chemotherapy and must accept her inevitable death. The couple have no children, partly due to Megan's illness and partly because of Tom's job. Tom is unable to deal with his wife's illness and implores her to continue treatment.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Janet Jackson was born on May 16, 1966 in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of ten children, to Katherine Esther (née Scruse) and Joseph Walter Jackson. The Jacksons were lower-middle class and devout Jehovah's Witnesses, although Jackson would later refrain from organized religion. At a young age, her brothers began performing as the Jackson 5 in the Chicago-Gary area. In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number-one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated to pursue a career in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio.At age seven, Jackson performed at the MGM Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. A biography revealed her father, Joseph Jackson, was emotionally withdrawn, and told her to address him solely by his first name as a child. She began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976.In 1977, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family and later got a recurring role on Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey from seasons three to six. Jackson also played the role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series, largely due to the emotional stress of her secret marriage to R&B singer, James DeBarge. Jackson later elaborated on her time on the show in an interview with Anderson Cooper, revealing that the cast would occasionally play pranks on her, but she spoke fondly of them.When Jackson was sixteen, her father and manager Joseph Jackson, arranged a contract for her with A&M Records. Her debut album, Janet Jackson, was released in 1982. It was produced by Angela Winbush, René Moore, Bobby Watson of Rufus and Leon Sylvers III, and overseen by her father Joseph.

SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who still appealed in his images and cultural references to an elite humanist and aristocratic audience? , can you please find it? Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.

Jin-tae Lee owns a shoeshine stand to pay for his younger brother Jin-seok's education. Jin-tae also bought a silver pen for Jin-seok. Jin-tae's fiancÃ©e Young-shin works with the Lee's noodle shop. On June 25, 1950, North Korea invades South Korea. Both brothers are forcibly conscripted. They then become a part of the 1st Infantry Division, fighting at the Pusan Perimeter and then advancing north. Jin-tae is told by his commanding officer that if he can earn the highest award for a South Korean soldier, the Taeguk Cordon of the Order of Military Merit, his brother can be sent home. Jin-tae willingly volunteers for many dangerous missions and is quickly promoted to the rank of Chungsa (Sergeant). His heroic feats during the urban battle of Pyongyang finally result in Jin-tae being nominated for the medal. His combat experiences quickly brutalize him into a cold-blood ruthless killer, which worries his horrified younger brother. The U.N. coalition is eventually forced to retreat all the way back to Seoul when the Chinese intervene in the war on the North Korean side. Jin-tae gets his medal but Young-shin is captured by a South Korean militia, and the brothers attempt to stop them from executing her for treason when she is accused of having joined a communist party under the Northern occupation.

Born Vina Fay Wray in Alberta, Canada on September 15, 1907, she later moved to the United States and became a naturalized American citizen. Wray started her acting career in the late 1920s and became known as one of the early \\"scream queens\\" due to her breakout performances in horror films. However, it was her role in \\"King Kong\\" that remains her most iconic role and the one she is best remembered for. In the film, Wray played Ann Darrow, an aspiring actress who is cast in a film by director Carl Denham, played by Robert Armstrong. The character of Ann Darrow is taken on a dangerous journey to Skull Island, where she encounters the giant ape known as Kong. The film follows the story of Kong's infatuation with Ann, his capture and subsequent tragic journey to New York City, where he ultimately meets his doom by falling off the Empire State Building. \\"King Kong\\" was directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, and at the time of its release, it was praised for its innovative special effects, which used stop-motion animation to bring the titular character to life. The film's success and lasting influence can be seen in the numerous remakes, sequels, and spin-offs it has inspired over the years, including the 1976 and 2005 remakes. After \\"King Kong,\\" Fay Wray continued to act in movies and on television, making appearances in films such as \\"Doctor X\\" (1932), \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" (1932), and \\"The Vampire Bat\\" (1933).

In 1985, the first part of the Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.The earliest parts of Ashton Town Hall, which was the first purpose-built town hall in what is now Tameside, date to 1840 when it was opened. It has classical features such as the Corinthian columns on the entrance facade. Enlarged in 1878, the hall provides areas for administrative purposes and public functions. Meanwhile, the Old Street drill hall was completed in 1887. There are five parks in the town, three of which have Green Flag Awards. The first park opened in Ashton-under-Lyne was Stamford Park on the border with Stalybridge. The park opened in 1873, following a 17-year campaign by local cotton workers; the land was bought from a local mill-owner for £15,000 (£1.4 million as of 2019) and further land was donated by George Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford. A crowd of between 60,000 and 80,000 turned out to see the Earl of Stamford formally open the new facility on 12 July 1873. It now includes a boating lake, and a memorial to Joseph Rayner Stephens, commissioned by local factory workers to commemorate his work promoting fair wages and improved working conditions.

Answer the following question: In year 2200, David is an astronaut and an avid galaxy hopper from a planet hundred light years away. He ended up in the solar system in search of water. He identified three planets, planet A, planet B and planet C. Little did he know that less than a hundred years ago people used to call planet A as Earth, planet B as Venus, and planet C as Mercury. Which planet would have lower pressure on the surface, planet A or planet B? Answer:","completion":"The pressure on the surface of a planet is determined by multiple factors such as the planet's gravity, the thickness of its atmosphere, and the type of atmospheric gases. Therefore, we would need to look at the historical data of both planet A (Earth) and planet B (Venus) to answer David's question. As we know from historical data: 1. Earth's (Planet A's) atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atmospheric unit (atm), which equates to approximately 101.3 kilopascals (kPa). 2. Venus's (Planet B's) atmospheric pressure at the surface, on the other hand, is much higher than Earth's. It's approximately 92 atm, or about 9300 kPa. This is due to a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, which creates a strong greenhouse effect. Considering this data, it can be concluded planet A (Earth) would have a lower pressure on its surface compared to planet B (Venus). So the answer is Planet A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the \\"intercostal clavicle\\". Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker) and the need to impress Elizabeth Random (May Robson), who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum. The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn) by chance on a golf course. She is a free-spirited young lady, and (unknown to him at first) Mrs. Random's niece. Susan's brother, Mark, has sent her a tame leopard from Brazil named Baby (Nissa) to give to their aunt. (The leopard is native to Africa and Asia but not to South America.) Susan thinks David is a zoologist (rather than a paleontologist), and persuades David to go to her country home in Connecticut to help bring up Baby (which includes singing \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\" to soothe the leopard). Complications arise as Susan falls in love with David and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible to prevent his marriage. David finally receives the intercostal clavicle, but Susan's dog George (Asta) steals and buries it. Susan's aunt, Elizabeth Random, arrives. The dowager is unaware of David's identity, since Susan has introduced him as \\"Mr. Bone\\". Baby and George run off, and Susan and David mistake a dangerous leopard who has escaped from a nearby circus (also portrayed by Nissa) for Baby. David and Susan in jail. They are jailed by a befuddled town policeman, Constable Slocum (Walter Catlett), for breaking into the house of Dr. Fritz Lehman (Fritz Feld) (where they had cornered the circus leopard). When Slocum does not believe their story, Susan tells him they are members of the \\"Leopard Gang\\"; she calls herself \\"Swingin' Door Susie\\", and David \\"Jerry the Nipper\\".[a] David fails to convince the constable that Susan makes things up \\"from motion pictures she's seen\\". Eventually, Alexander Peabody (George... Answer:","completion":"\\"Love, Leopards, and Lost Bones: The Huxley Misadventure\\" The movie title \\"Love, Leopards, and Lost Bones: The Huxley Misadventure\\" captures the essence of the unique and chaotic story involving paleontologist David Huxley, his pursuit of the final piece for his Brontosaurus skeleton, and his unexpected encounter with Susan Vance, a spontaneous and vivacious young woman. With the balance between love, mystery, and comedic elements, this title perfectly encapsulates the adventure that unfolds between David, Susan, and the various intriguing characters they meet along the way. The title highlights three main aspects of the plot—love, leopards, and the lost bone, all of which deeply impact David's life throughout his journey. \\"Love\\" refers to the unexpected romantic chemistry between David and Susan. Although David is initially on a quest to get the intercostal clavicle bone for his Brontosaurus skeleton and secure a significant donation to his museum, love enters his life in the most unpredictable fashion through Susan, leading him on an adventure far away from his original goals. \\"Leopards\\" is a reference to Baby, the seemingly tame leopard, and the other dangerous leopard who escaped from a nearby circus. These creatures serve as plot devices, as they bring David and Susan together on their journey to find the elusive animals and return them safely. Additionally, the leopards symbolize Susan's wild and untamable spirit, which gradually rubs off on David as the story progresses. The \\"Lost Bones\\" part of the title emphasizes the pivotal MacGuffin that drives David's story - the missing intercostal clavicle. The bone represents David's passion for paleontology and the critical scientific discovery he hopes to complete. It also adds an element of urgency and frustration to the plot, as David faces multiple obstacles in his pursuit, from Susan's determined attempts to keep him with her to George the dog, who steals and buries the precious bone. Finally, the subtitle \\"The Huxley Misadventure\\" underscores the protagonist's involvement in this chaotic world, while hinting at the unexpected and absurd turn of events that transpire throughout the film. It serves as a nod to the classic screwball comedies, which are known for their zany, fast-paced plots and slapstick humor. In conclusion, \\"Love, Leopards, and Lost Bones: The Huxley Misadventure\\" encapsulates the enthralling and entertaining nature of the proposed movie plot while keeping in line with the spirit of screwball comedy. By highlighting critical aspects of the storyline – love, leopards, and the missing bone – this title invites the viewers to immerse themselves in a quirky and romantic tale filled with twists, turns, and laughter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sir Geoffrey Howe, also known as Lord Howe of Aberavon, was a significant figure in the politics of the United Kingdom, particularly under the leadership of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, with whom he had a tumultuous but important relationship. He served in a variety of positions including Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary, and finally Leader of the House of Commons and Deputy Prime Minister. The quote you provided is extracted from his notable resignation speech, which he delivered on November 13, 1988, to the House of Commons. This speech is considered one of the most dramatic and important political speeches in recent British history. It was seen as a severe blow to Prime Minister Thatcher's leadership and played a key role in her eventual downfall. The cricket analogy used by Howe was particularly striking. Geoffrey Howe was known for being quite mild-mannered, and the comparison of Thatcher’s leadership to a cricket team captain breaking their opening batsman's bat before the game was an unexpectedly sharp criticism which resonated throughout the House of Commons and the British public. Howe's complaint was predominantly about Thatcher's approach to European policy. The key issue at the time surrounded the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Economic Community, later known as the European Union. To sum up, the cricket analogy was a critique on how he felt Mrs. Thatcher undermined her ministers' negotiations in Europe. Despite her public profession of supporting those negotiations, Howe felt her actions led to an inconsistency in Britain’s European policy and severely damaged the credibility and authority of the government, hence his resignation. His speech was designed to convey the frustration and reservations that he, as well as some other colleagues, had about Thatcher's leadership style and policies. It was one of the key events leading to Margaret Thatcher's resignation from the post of Prime Minister two weeks later. So, it had a significant impact on the political landscape in the UK."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Speer and Murphy were once good friends, which changed after Murphy left the force.[1] On a rainy night, Speer comes to a diner for coffee. Two goons arrive, looking for Murphy. They pounce the minute Murphy arrives, starting a fistfight. Speer, no fan of Murphy's, ignores the fight until a goon causes him to spill his coffee. Both goons are thrown through the front door. Murphy sarcastically thanks Speer for saving his life. The two rivals have eyes for Murphy's secretary Addy (Jane Alexander). She loves both and proves it when, after tenderly kissing Murphy goodbye, goes on a date with Speer. Murphy does have a new romantic interest, a rich socialite named Caroline Howley (Madeline Kahn), but finds himself unable to commit. Speer and Addy go to a boxing match at which the mob boss Primo Pitt (Rip Torn) is present. Murphy's partner Dehl Swift (Richard Roundtree) is also there, and seems to be in cahoots with Pitt and his gang.

Your task is to generate answer \\"yes\\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \\"no\\". Review: Bad Actors, bad filming, choppy dialog, shallow characters, but then again it was a bad premise in the first place. Basically, an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal. Of course, the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house, cash a check for 1,000,000 dollars, and even foil three bumbling idiots, reminiscent of the three stooges. Preston Blake is an annoying, obnoxious, boy, who decides that, when written a blank check by a complete stranger, he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can. In other words, he wanders into a bank, hands a teller a check he makes in his printer, and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash. Preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle, due to the fact that a man driving a Jaguar after Preston and his 10-speed could not catch him, even when Preston jumped a row of cars.Of course, with every hokey adventure movie, there has to be hot heroine. In this case our hot heroine is a child molesting FBI agent who dates the eleven year old Preston, and promises another date when he turns 17. However, the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting, nor its sloppy dialog, such as \\"The only other way I could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it's butt and then pick up the fur\\". It was, rather, the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the FBI does not give a damn about random people . What I have failed to explain is that Preston uses the alias \\"Macintosh\\" to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts. Of course, the FBI finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses his 11-year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face, then treat her to hamburgers, finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison's from the ground. Our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the FBI is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two, as they make their way to Preston's limousine, complete with a 1-dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap, 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on.Overall: 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this film.

Please answer the following question: - A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - Miners enter the mine - Miners remove the coal from the mine - The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - The coal is moved up to the surface - The coal is loaded onto a truck What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step of the process after the coal has been loaded onto a truck would likely involve transporting the coal to its final destination, such as a coal processing plant, power plant, or port for export. This step is vital as it ensures that the mined coal is put to effective use, whether it is for electricity generation or other industrial applications. Once the coal reaches its destination, it may undergo further processing, cleaning, and preparation before it is consumed or sold. At the coal processing plant, the coal may be crushed and sized to remove any impurities, such as rock and soil particles. This process is essential to improve the coal's quality and ensure it meets the required standards for specific applications. For instance, when used for electricity generation, the coal must have a specific energy content and particle size to burn efficiently in power plant boilers. Similarly, coal used in steel production must meet specific requirements on impurities, ash, and sulfur content. Once the coal is processed and cleaned, it can be transported to facilities that use coal as a primary energy source. For example, power plants generate electricity by burning the coal to produce steam, which drives turbines and generates electrical power. In the case of coal used for steel production, it is transformed into coke – a fuel with few impurities and high carbon content - and used in blast furnaces to create pig iron, a key ingredient in steelmaking. For coal designated for export, it may be transported to a nearby port facility, where it is loaded onto cargo ships or barges for shipment to customers around the world. The coal can be exported either as a raw material or after undergoing preliminary processing, depending on the preferences and requirements of the importing countries. Once the coal is consumed or sold, the lifecycle process will start again, with more coal mined from the earth, transported, processed, and used to meet the world's energy and industrial needs. The entire process highlights the importance of efficient and environmentally responsible mining, transportation, and utilization practices to ensure the sustainability and minimize the environmental impact of coal's production and consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He has won 14 major tournament titles and about 122 million in prize money and ads. He also has a happy family. It seems that he is too perfect to be one of us. But Woods has more in common with you than you might think. Woods' parents -- particularly his father -- set high expectations for him when he was a child. Before Earl Woods' death in 2006, he told Golf magazine, \\"My purpose in raising Tiger was not to raise a golfer. I wanted to raise a good person.\\" By age two, Woods was already swinging a golf club. But once he entered school, Woods' father was careful to send the message that school work came first. Woods wasn't allowed to practice until his homework was done. When Woods finally reached the professional tour, his father continued to expect a lot of him. \\"Tiger will do more than any other man in history to change the course of human. The world is just getting a taste of his power,\\" he said in 1996. Clearly, Earl Woods had great expectations of his son. In this way, Tiger Woods is actually like a lot of us. Many of us feel a similar pressure to make our parents proud. When this happens, it's easy to let that pressure overwhelm us. In a perfect world, we would all grow up to be Tiger Woods-like successes in our own fields. But that isn't possible.

The 100-megawatt battery is connected to a wind farm run by French company Neoen and will store renewable energy in an effort to prevent blackouts like those that have affected the country's \\"most wind power-dependent state\\" over the last year, per Reuters. South Australia Premier Jay Weatherill says it still needs to undergo testing but will be ready for Australia's summer, which officially begins on Dec. 1.

This big battery is actually very important because it's going to store energy that's made in a way that's good for our planet, like wind power, and help prevent blackouts. Blackouts are like when you accidentally turn off the light switch, but instead of just one room going dark, it's many houses and buildings that lose power all at the same time and this can last for a long time.

But, he assures that it'll be ready for Australia's summer, which begins on December 1st. What's also amazing is that Musk and his team were able to finish this project very fast. Elon Musk even promised that he and his team would finish the battery within 100 days or it would be given to Australia for free. But they did it! And in less than 100 days, so Australia had to pay for it after all. The battery will be able to supply power to around 30,000 homes for an hour.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"The 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry was recognised as a unit after the start of the war\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry was recognized as a unit after the start of the American Civil War. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, it became increasingly necessary to establish organized military units to support the Union Army's efforts. Thus, the 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry was formed as a three-month volunteer unit. This formation occurred at the beginning of the war, showing that the regiment's recognition indeed happened post the commencement of the war. However, their role was not limited to these initial three months. As the war continued, it was evident that the conflict wouldn't end swiftly. Hence, the 11th Regiment was reorganized into a three-year unit, highlighting that their service was extended beyond the early stages of the war, catering to the Union’s needs as the war kept unfolding. The unit was recognized based on the requirements of wartime, and it remained functional and involved until the end of the war. Deployed in numerous battles and operations during the Civil War, their recognition was likely reinforced and appreciated over the years, given their extensive service duration. The history and performance of the 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry manifest that their recognition was not only after the start of the war but continued throughout its progress, lasting until the cessation of the hostilities. Therefore, the statement that \\"The 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry was recognized as a unit after the start of the war\\" is accurate according to the information provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the information given, you mentioned that \\"I lived in a little town called Newmarket.\\" That statement directly states that you lived in the town. Thus, it follows that \\"I lived in Newmarket.\\" Newmarket, depending on the country, can be a small town located in several places - for example, in England, Canada, or the United States. These towns might have their own unique characteristics, history, and community life. Living in a small town often comes with a strong sense of community, where people tend to be well-acquainted with each other, and the pace of life may be more relaxed compared to a big city. You might have experienced local events such as annual festivals, parades, or farmers' markets that brought the community together. The town may have charming architecture, natural attractions, or local landmarks that make it distinctive and memorable. Inhabitants generally appreciate the close-knit nature of the community and the slower pace of life that small towns offer. It is essential to note, however, that the quality of life in a small town such as Newmarket would largely depend on an individual's preferences, lifestyle, and needs. Though small-town living is tremendously appealing to many people, some individuals might prefer the anonymity and excitement of a bustling city. In conclusion, based on your statement, it is accurate to say that \\"I lived in Newmarket.\\" This statement implies that you resided in a small town called Newmarket, which might have given you a chance to become acquainted with a close-knit community and experience the charm of small-town living.

Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

This article: Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival. The event, promoted by Newcastle University re-enacted many world civil rights stories throughout history.

The Packers got on the board first with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers to Davante Adams. The Lions responded with a 42-yard field goal from Matt Prater. Green Bay accumulated a big lead with two touchdown catches by Jordy Nelson for eight and later 17 yards, one by Richard Rodgers from two-yards, as well as a 36-yard field goal from Mason Crosby. Detroit made the halftime score 31-10 after Marvin Jones caught a 17-yard touchdown catch from Matthew Stafford. After the break, the Lions attempted a comeback with touchdown catches by Anquan Boldin and Marvin Jones, from two and 45-yards respectively, as well a 50-yard Prater field goal. Despite only allowing a 46-yard Packers field goal in the second half, the Lions came up short, losing 27-34. How many points were scored in the second half of the game?","completion":"The second half of this Lions vs. Packers game saw a total of 19 points scored. This can be calculated by adding up each of the scores mentioned. From the Lions' side, they scored two touchdowns and a field goal after the break. Both of the touchdowns, which were 6 points apiece, were caught by Anquan Boldin and Marvin Jones. The touchdowns accounted for 12 points. In addition, their kicker, Matt Prater, also kicked a successful 50-yard field goal, which accounts for another 3 points. On the Packers' side, the only score mentioned for the second half was a 46-yard field goal by Mason Crosby. A successful field goal in American football is worth 3 points. So, the total points scored in the second half is: Lions' points (12 for touchdowns + 3 for the field goal = 15) + Packers' points (3 for the field goal) = 15 + 3 = 18 points. But it's mentioned in the context that the Lions came up short, losing 27-34. That would mean the Lions scored 17 points in the second half and the Packers scored 3 points in the second half. So, the total points scored in the second half is: Lions' points (17) + Packers' points (3) = 20 points. Given the inconsistent figures, cross-checking is advised to find out the correct total points scored in the second half."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sentence 1: Then, a few days ago, another girl gave birth in the bathroom at her high-school prom and dumped the baby in the trash, where it would later be found dead. Sentence 2: Yet another girl abandoned her newborn in the trash of her high-school, where it was eventually found dead. Select from: - yes; - it is not possible to tell; - no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Entailment in a linguistic or semantic context means that the truth of one sentence ensures the truth of another. In this scenario, the second sentence is a simplification or a rewording of the events described in the first sentence, with no additional details or alterations to the core information that would negate or contradict the original sentence's content. To break it down: 1) Both sentences involve a girl giving birth. 2) Both sentences describe the event occurring in the setting of a high school. 3) Both instances culminate in the unfortunate abandonment of the newborn in the trash where both of them were later found dead. While the first sentence includes the additional detail about the event occurring during the high-school prom, it doesn’t significantly alter the entailment unless the condition of it being prom night is critical to the truth of the second sentence. Additionally, the transition from 'another girl' in the first sentence to 'yet another girl' in the second sentence infers a continuity of similar incidents but does not significantly change the entailment as it is an expression more focused on the frequency of the situation. Therefore, considering the above points, the second sentence is considered as being entailed by the first sentence. This is because the truth of the first sentence guarantees the truth of the second sentence, as all the key factors align: the mother's actions (giving birth and abandoning the newborn), location (high-school) and the unfortunate outcome (the baby being found, dead)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He found that the Siberian tiger is an apex predator. It had a pretty stable population during the sixteenth century. He noted that information as case A. Then with the introduction of guns the number of Siberian tigers decreased in the seventeenth century. He noted that information as case B. In case B, would the number of mesopredators be less or more than in case A? A:","completion":"In this scenario, let's first define some terms to better understand the situation. 1. Apex predator: These are the animals at the top of the food chain, meaning that they don't have any natural predators. In this case, the Siberian tiger is the apex predator. 2. Mesopredator: Animals that are not at the top of the food chain, but still consume other species, are referred to as mesopredators. They have predators of their own, which in this scenario would be the Siberian tiger. Now let's analyze case A and case B. Case A: During the sixteenth century, there was a stable population of Siberian tigers, indicating a relatively balanced ecosystem. The Siberian tigers, as apex predators, would prey upon and limit the population of mesopredators in their territory. Case B: In the seventeenth century, the introduction of guns led to a decrease in the number of Siberian tigers. When the population of apex predators declines, this can cause what's known as \\"mesopredator release.\\" Mesopredator release is a phenomenon where the reduced presence of a controlling apex predator leads to an increase in the population of mesopredators, as they face less predation and have more access to prey. Based on this analysis, it is likely that in case B, the number of mesopredators would be more than in case A. The reduced population of Siberian tigers (the apex predator) would give mesopredators more room to flourish, leading to a higher population of these secondary predators. However, it's important to note that other factors, such as availability of prey and changes in habitat, can also influence mesopredator populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems, which can cause tinnitus, can be successfully treated with chiropractic treatment. TMJ problems may trigger tinnitus because of the proximity of muscles and ligaments that attach to the jaw and the hearing bones. A chiropractic treatment would consist of manual manipulation in order to re-align the TMJ. The chiropractor might also manipulate the vertebrae of the neck in order to decrease the symptoms of tinnitus. Chiropractic adjustments are not painful, but they may cause some temporary discomfort. The chiropractic treatment may also include the application of heat or ice and specific exercises. Chiropractic treatments can also help with Meniere’s disease, another less common cause of tinnitus. A recent review of studies of the success of acupuncture for tinnitus concluded that there was some cause for hope. Acupuncture techniques would vary based on the underlying cause for the tinnitus. These techniques also often include traditional Chinese herbs. There's no guarantee that acupuncture will help. Aldosterone is a hormone found in your adrenal gland that regulates sodium and potassium in your blood. Aldosterone deficiency may cause tinnitus, so taking a supplement may help you find relief. Talk to your doctor if you think you may need more aldosterone. There is a relatively new approach that may be useful for some. The idea is to find the frequency of the particular sound in your ears and masking that specific frequency with specially designed sounds. Your ENT or audiologist may have recommendations about these treatments. You may also find these treatments available online for a fee through websites such as Audionotch and Tinnitracks. These services walk you through testing for the specific frequency of your tinnitus and design a treatment protocol.

Kate Reardon, editor of high-society magazine Tatler, said many _ Britons acted as if they didn't really care about receiving an invitation while secretly checking the mail every day to see if the invitation had arrived. \\"Everyone's been hoping,\\" she said. William and Middleton have showed their modern side by inviting a number of close friends, including some former sweethearts, the newspaper said. The wedding is not technically a state event, which somewhat limits the protocol requirements applied to the guest list. But royal obligations still order that a large number of the 1,900 or so seats go to guests from the world of politics, not actual friends of the couple. The couple have also invited many guests from the charities they work with, and Middleton has used her influence to invite the butcher, shopkeeper and pub owner from her home village of Bucklebury.

A question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera, lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer. Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the County of Los Angeles, while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon CD-ROMS, but when disaster befalls \\"Mistress Vanessa\\", virtuous Celia, determined to unearth her sister's vicious attacker, begins a new job as a \\"sex slave\\" at the private Castle Club where the specialty of the house is a \\"dungeon party\\". Two FBI field agents (whose deployment to the Vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet BDSM sites), in addition to a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective, are assigned to investigate the crime, while endeavouring to provide security for Celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her. Flaws in logic and continuity abound, such as a homicide being allocated to L.A.P.D.'s Operations-South Bureau, a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film. Direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic post-production editing and sound reproduction. The mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movie's end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario. One solid acting turn appears among this slag: Stan Abe as a zealous FBI agent.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mostly negative. The reviewer thinks the movie is a mess with a weak and incoherent story. They mention problems with the direction, editing, and sound.

Along their way through the forest on horseback, Ingeri becomes frightened when they come to a stream-side mill and the two part and Karin sets out on her own.

One day, while trying to make a living for his family, he heard a cry for help coming from a nearby bog. He dropped his tools and ran to the bog. There, tapped to his waist in black mud, was a terrified boy, screaming and struggling to free himself. Farmer Fleming saved the boy from what could have been a slow and terrifying death. The next day, a fancy carriage pulled up to the Scotsman' s surroundings. An elegantly dressed nobleman stepped out and introduced himself as the father of the boy Farmer Fleming had saved. \\"I want to repay you,\\" said the nobleman. \\"You saved my son' s life.\\" \\"No, I can' t accept payment for what I did,\\" the Scottish farmer replied, waving off the offer.

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

Corbis T een pregnancy pays... at least if you're Bristol Palin. According to tax documents, the unwed mother and eldest daughter of Sarah Palin raked in more than 262,500 last year working to promote teen abstinence for The Candie's Foundation. Meanwhile, the same foundation distributed only 35,000 in grants to health and counseling clinics for pregnant teens. Is Bristol's big payday bigger than it should have been? Yes, this is outrageous opportunism: It seems Bristol has \\"learned a great deal from her mother,\\" namely \\"how to milk her celebrity status for all it's worth,\\" says E.D. Kain in Forbes. By my calculations, for every dollar that Bristol's promotional efforts funnelled into deserving causes, she earned 7.50 for herself. I know the non-profit industry has its issues, but I'm surprised to see some \\"so blatantly abuse their position at a supposed charity.\\" \\"Non-profit pays Bristol Palin 262,500, donates only 35,000 to charity\\" No, this is par for the course: \\"Before you cry foul over Palin's paycheck,\\" consider that other celeb spokespeople for Candie's Foundation include Hillary Duff, Fergie, and Ciara, and \\"it's doubtful that any of them are doing it for less than a quarter mil,\\" says Megan Angelo at Business Insider. Besides, if you're outraged over what Sarah's daughter pulled in last year, just wait till you see her tax returns for 2010 and 2011, when she appeared on \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" and signed a deal to write her memoir, respectively. \\"You might as well get used to the age of Bristol.\\" \\"Bristol Palin is making more money than you talking about teen pregnancy\\" Well, at least give her credit for being industrious: \\"Setting aside the debate about her ability to... actually make a difference in the lives of others, she certainly struck while the timing was right,\\" says Ryan Hamilton Jr. at Gather. While it's perhaps shocking that Bristol made so much money, it's also \\"quite impressive\\" that she'll be able to provide a nice life for her young son. \\"This just goes to show that there are definitely opportunities out there for people who don't finish high school.\\" \\"Bristol Palin salary huge for teen pregnancy work\\" ||||| In this July 25, 2009, photo, former Alaska Gov.

(Associated Press) In this July 25, 2009, photo, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol Palin holds her and Levi Johnston's son Tripp Johnston at the governor's picnic in Anchorage, Alaska. Tax documents show... (Associated Press) Bristol Palin was well worth the 332,500 she was paid to be an ambassador for a foundation aiming to prevent teen pregnancy, the organization's founder said Wednesday. In her 2009 debut with The Candies Foundation, the unwed mother and daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was paid 262,500 for 15 to 20 days of work, and another 70,000 for a less amount of work last year. The money spent has been \\"an amazing investment,\\" according to foundation founder Neil Cole. The fact that the 20-year-old Bristol Palin was a teen mother herself shows the problem is a national epidemic, not one limited to inner cities or minorities, Cole said. Her work advocating abstinence through public service announcements, media interviews and TV and radio spots amounts to more than a billion impressions on people, he said, citing a study conducted by the foundation. \\"Someone said in our organization today, Bristol's the gift that keeps on giving,\\" he said. Palin family attorney John Tiemessen did not immediately return requests for comment Wednesday. Bristol Palin was 18 when she took the job with the New York-based foundation in 2009, months after giving birth to son, Tripp. She and the boy's father, Levi Johnston, are no longer together. Her pregnancy was announced days after Sen. John McCain picked her mother to be his Republican vice presidential running mate in 2008. Bristol Palin told The Associated Press last year she \\"wasn't prepared at all\\" for the dramatic changes in her life since giving birth in December 2008. \\"It changes literally every aspect of your life, and if girls realized how hard it was to be a teen mom, they would think twice about having sex without the proper education and proper knowledge,\\" she said. Palin is no longer on the payroll, but she remains a friend of the organization, Cole said. \\"She has done incredible work,\\" he said. \\"She's been bold enough _ yes she's been paid for her work _ but she's bold enough to get in and talk about it.\\" Public service announcements by Palin and another celebrity, Jenny McCarthy, are far more effective than those featuring non-celebrities, according to a survey of 1,000 teens commissioned in January by the foundation. A third of respondents said Palin's message made them consider the consequences of teen pregnancy, compared with 16 percent for non-celebrities. Among those surveyed, 57 percent said Palin got their attention and 41 percent called her message powerful, compared with no more than 28 percent and 11 percent, respectively, for non-celebrities. The Candie's Foundation is a division of the apparel brand Candie's. Cole said there were 1 million teen pregnancies a year when the foundation first started in 2001, compared with the current rate of 750,000 annually. Bloggers have criticized the organization for paying Palin more than seven times the 35,000 in grants it issued in 2009 to two organizations that tax documents called \\"public charities providing services to teenagers at risk.\\" Cole said there is no basis for that criticism. \\"That's not what we do for a living,\\" he said. \\"What we do for a living is create awareness.\\" ||||| Summary:","completion":"Bristol Palin, the eldest daughter of Sarah Palin, made a lot of money working to promote teen abstinence for The Candie's Foundation.

Background: Phillips was born in Albany, Georgia, to Sheryl (Jacks) and Phillip LaDon \\"Donnie\\" Phillips, Sr., and moved to Leesburg, Georgia when he was 12. He has two older sisters, LaDonna, the eldest, and Lacey. Phillips grew up in Sasser and Leesburg, and attended Lee County High School. He graduated from Albany Technical College with a major in Industrial Systems Technology, but missed the graduation ceremony due to his obligations to American Idol. Context: Phillips auditioned in Savannah, Georgia. He sang \\"Superstition\\" by Stevie Wonder. The judges then asked him to perform a second song with his guitar, and he performed Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller.\\" He advanced to the Hollywood rounds, and later to the Las Vegas round. On February 23, 2012, Phillips was chosen as one of the Top 25 semi-finalists, and was then voted into the Top 13. His performance style on the show has been compared to Dave Matthews, and he covered one of his songs, \\"The Stone,\\" in the competition. When asked about Phillips' imitation of his style, Dave Matthews said: \\"More power to him, I don't mind,\\" and added \\"He should kick my ass, [then] maybe I can retire and he can take over my band.\\" Mentor Stevie Nicks said Phillips would have been good enough to join Fleetwood Mac back in 1975, after his performance of Jonny Lang's Still Rainin, which he received a standing ovation from the judges. After the Top 13 performance night, Phillips was taken to a doctor for possible kidney stones. He had eight procedures while he was on Idol, and considered quitting the show due to the pain. For his Top 3 performance, Phillips sang Bob Seger's \\"We've Got Tonight.\\" For Top 4, he did a cover of Damien Rice's Volcano - which has been heralded as one of the best American Idol performances of all time. As the sole contestant who was never in jeopardy of elimination in any week of the competition, Phillips became the winner on the finale against Jessica Sanchez after a record-breaking 132 million votes were cast. His coronation song, \\"Home,\\" was released after his performance, and had the biggest digital sales week for any Idol winner's coronation song. ^Note 1 Due to the judges using their one save on Jessica Sanchez, the Top 7 remained intact for another week.

The statement \\"In 2003, the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the Bizere Monastery near the River Mureş in present-day Romania\\" does not correctly answer the question of \\"when the mosaics at Bizere Monastery were created.\\" This statement only provides information about the year in which the remains of the mosaic were discovered, not when they were created. To offer a comprehensive response, it's essential to briefly introduce the historical context and the significance of the Bizere Monastery. The Bizere Monastery, known since the 12th century, was a medieval Benedictine abbey situated in the Arad County of present-day Romania. It played a vital role in the region's spiritual and cultural development. However, multiple invasions and destructions ultimately led to its ruin. Now, regarding the mosaics, when they were discovered in 2003, researchers and archaeologists conducted thorough analyses and studies to estimate their age and historical importance. Through these examinations, the experts were able to determine that these beautifully detailed Byzantine-style mosaic pavements date back to the 12th century. This period matches the early development and existence of the Bizere Monastery. Thus, the mosaics' creation can be estimated to have taken place during the 12th century. In summary, the statement provided indicates the year of the mosaics' discovery at the Bizere Monastery, not the time of their creation. The information extracted from archaeological studies and historical analyses establishes that the mosaics were most likely created during the 12th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the following year blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début, as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls, demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre. Montrose, including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre, released their first album in 1973. Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona, achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era. In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic (1975), which reached number 11 in the American album chart, and Rocks (1976), which peaked at number three. Blue Öyster Cult, formed in the late 60s, picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees (1975), followed by their first platinum album, Agents of Fortune (1976), containing the hit single \\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\\", which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts. Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album. In the same year, hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and The Runaways débuted with their self-titled album. While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound, the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock. The Amboy Dukes, having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their Top 20 psychedelic hit \\"Journey to the Center of the Mind\\" (1968), were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent, who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent (1975) and his best selling Double Live Gonzo (1978).

These reasons range from the practical aspects of using a recorder to its efficiency and versatility. Here is a detailed explanation to support the rationale for selecting \\"recorder\\" as the answer: 1. Technological functionality: A recorder, whether it is a digital voice recorder or a mobile app, is specifically designed to capture and store audio data. It allows users to clearly and accurately record voices, conversations, or other sounds during meetings, lectures, interviews, and various other settings. This advantage makes it an ideal tool for recording something in a reliable manner. 2. Ease of use: Modern recorders are often user-friendly and can be operated with minimal technical knowledge. Most recorders have a simple interface with buttons such as \\"record,\\" \\"play,\\" \\"stop,\\" and \\"delete\\" that make it easy to record and manage recordings. This intuitive design allows users to capture important information quickly and efficiently. 3. Portability: Recorders are often small, lightweight, and easy to transport or carry along in various situations. This portability ensures that you can have a means of recording something with you at all times, making it a practical choice for various environments and situations. 4. High-quality audio: Recorders, particularly digital ones, can provide a high-quality audio recording with clear and crisp sound. This ensures that the recorded information is easily understandable and can be listened to multiple times or shared with others for analysis or reference. 5. Time-stamped organization: Some recorders allow users to categorize and organize recorded files with time stamps or labels. This organizational feature helps users easily locate specific recordings when needed, making the entire process more efficient. 6. Digital storage and sharing: Most modern recorders offer digital storage solutions, including internal memory or removable SD cards, as well as USB or wireless transfer options for downloading or sharing the recordings. This makes it easy to store and access the recorded data for future reference or even share it with other individuals. In comparison, the alternative options are not as suitable for recording something: - Tape: While a tape can be used to record something, it’s an outdated technology and presents several limitations in terms of audio quality, storage capacity, and accessibility. - Writing on paper: This method has its own merit but is not efficient for recording live events, as it can be difficult to keep up with the information being shared. Moreover, it is prone to human error and may not capture all of the details. - Documentation of facts: This choice is more about organizing or presenting information rather than recording it. Using a recorder would be more beneficial in capturing data accurately before organizing or documenting it. - Spell checker: This option is unrelated to recording something and is more focused on correcting spelling mistakes in written text. Because of these reasons, the sensible rationale is to choose \\"recorder\\" as the best option for recording something among the given alternatives. Its advanced features, ease of use, portability, and organizational capabilities make it the most appropriate and efficient choice for accurately capturing various types of information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The bill allows for greater governmental regulation of the U.S. food system. The Food and Drug Administration will be able to issue direct recalls of foods. The bill includes the biggest overhaul of the food safety system since 1938. Article:","completion":"Title: President Obama Signs Groundbreaking Food Safety Bill, Revolutionizing the U.S. Food System Subtitle: The Food Safety Modernization Act Allows for Increased Governmental Regulation and Powers in the Interest of Public Health Introduction: The United States food system is about to change drastically. In a landmark moment, President Obama has signed the long-awaited food safety bill. This legislation, known as the Food Safety Modernization Act, marks the biggest overhaul of the country's food safety regulations since 1938, and promises sweeping changes that aim to protect the health and safety of American consumers. Greater Governmental Regulation of the U.S. Food System: The signing of the food safety bill will allow for much greater governmental regulation of the entire U.S. food system, from farm to table. This is a crucial step, given the dramatic increase in the complexity of food distribution networks and global supply chains in recent decades. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will now have enhanced powers to ensure that food producers adhere to the highest safety standards, significantly lowering the risk of foodborne illnesses and contamination incidents that have plagued the country in recent times. Direct Recalls of Foods by the FDA: One of the most important changes brought about by the new food safety bill is that it empowers the FDA to issue direct recalls of foods that are suspected to be contaminated or otherwise dangerous for consumption. Previously, the FDA had to rely on food producers to voluntarily recall affected items, a process that was often hindered by bureaucratic obstacles and delays. With the new legislation in place, American consumers can expect faster action and a more streamlined process for removing tainted food products from store shelves. The Biggest Overhaul Since 1938: It is vital to remember that this is not just another regulatory tweak - the Food Safety Modernization Act represents the most significant shift in the U.S. food safety system in over 80 years. The new law is a comprehensive attempt to modernize and streamline food safety protocols, as well as to enhance the powers of the FDA to protect public health. The bill acknowledges that the existing 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is no longer adequate to address the challenges of today’s complex food production landscape. Increased Collaboration and Proactivity: Another key aspect of the new food safety bill is that it encourages greater collaboration between different federal, state, and local agencies to detect and respond to food safety threats more effectively. The legislation mandates the creation of new communication channels and integrated IT systems that will allow for improved information sharing and faster coordinated response in the event of an outbreak or contamination incident. This increased proactivity will enable authorities to contain potential threats before they spiral out of control and put the wider public at risk. Conclusion: The Food Safety Modernization Act is a groundbreaking piece of legislation that signifies a major leap forward in the federal government's ability to protect the American public from foodborne illnesses and other food safety threats. By granting the FDA greater powers to regulate the food system and to issue direct recalls, the new law will vastly improve the speed and effectiveness with which dangerous food products are removed from store shelves. Furthermore, by fostering greater collaboration and proactivity among regulatory agencies, the U.S. can expect a stronger and more effective food safety system in both preventing and responding to foodborne dangers. With the biggest overhaul of food safety regulations since 1938 now signed into law, the future of America's food system looks a lot brighter and safer for all its citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Math Problem Solve -5*u - 21 + 46 = 0 for u.","completion":"To solve the equation -5*u - 21 + 46 = 0 for u, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. Combine the constant terms -21 and 46. -5*u - 21 + 46 = -5*u + 25 = 0 Now the simplified equation is: -5*u + 25 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable u. To do this, we'll move all the terms with the variable u on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Subtract 25 from both sides of the equation: -5*u + 25 - 25 = 0 - 25 This simplifies to: -5*u = -25 Step 3: Solve for u. Now that we have isolated u, we'll just need to divide both sides by -5 to find the value of u: (-5*u) / (-5) = (-25) / (-5) This simplifies to: u = 5 So, the solution for the equation -5*u - 21 + 46 = 0 is u = 5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Use sandpaper, steel wool, or anything else abrasive to clean away any grime or dirt from any areas of your pipes and fittings that need to be soldered. This will let your solder hold more tightly to the pipe and result in a more sturdy connection. You should only need to clean around 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of the piping to give you room to solder easily. If you're using a larger pipe fitting, you may need to clean more to ensure the point of overlap between the pipe and the fitting is prepared for soldering. Use 120-grit sandpaper or grade 1 steel wool for cleaning your pipe fittings. This should be enough to strip away dirt and grime without damaging the pipes themselves. If you plan on cutting and soldering a lot of pipes, you might benefit from a specialised pipe cleaner. This will let you more easily scrub away any impurities on the inside and outside of your pipes. Ask at your local hardware store or look online to find one that suits your needs. Use a small paintbrush to cover the ends of your pipes and the insides of your pipe fittings with a thin layer of flux. Look around the edges of the pipe for any large lumps of flux and brush them away. Any type of flux that you have will work when soldering pipes together. Acid flux will be more corrosive, but may damage pipes that are too fragile. Tinning flux will help hold your pipes together more strongly, but may be more difficult to find or more expensive. If you're unsure, ask at your local hardware store for advice on the best type of flux to use for the job you're working on. Hold the two sections you need to connect together in each hand, keeping them off of your work surface to prevent any flux from rubbing off. Push the two ends together securely until they are fully connected. Wipe away any flux that comes off with a clean paintbrush. You should connect a section of a few pipes together before you begin to solder them. Working one at a time may be very slow, and trying to deal with a long section all at once may be very difficult! Work with a few pieces at a time. Heat will make the metal expand, so you should always heat the larger sections of your pipes up before the smaller sections. Hold a soldering iron to the pipe, or use a blowtorch to heat the metal up until the soldering flux melts into the joint and begins to bubble slightly. When the flux is just starting to bubble and the pipe is hot, press the tip of the solder to the opposite side as you are holding the blowtorch. The solder should melt immediately and work into the joint to hold it together. Pull the torch away and quickly run the solder around the circumference of the joint to completely seal it. You should only need to use around 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) of the solder to completely seal the pipe. If the solder doesn't run into the joint and forms small beads that roll away from it instead, you might have burnt the flux or may not have cleaned the pipe properly. Wait until the pipes are cooled, disconnect them and start again. It's easier to reach around the back side of the pipe if you bend a small hook in the solder wire before you begin soldering. Grip the solder far enough away from the tip that you won't risk melted solder getting on your hands. For extra safety, wear fire-resistant gloves as you work. Once the pipes have cooled a little, look around the edges of the joints to make sure they are evenly coated with solder. If you notice any sections without solder, apply a small amount of flux on the area and let it melt with the residual heat of the pipes. Use the blowtorch to heat the pipe up again and apply a small amount of solder to the bare area. It may take a while to get a good feel for when pipes are completely soldered. As a general rule of thumb, as long as there is a thin, silvery trim around the edges of your fittings, the pipe should be fully soldered. Summary:","completion":"Clean and prepare pipes and fittings with sandpaper or steel wool, apply flux, connect the pieces, heat with a soldering iron or blowtorch, and use solder to seal the joint for a sturdy pipe connection."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Valitettavasti alalla ei näy minkäänlaista edistystä, vaikka joitain epämääräisiä lupauksia on annettu politiikan sisällyttämisestä EU:n uudistussopimukseen. Translate to English","completion":"Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any progress in the field, although some vague promises have been made about incorporating politics into the EU's reform treaty. It is clear from this statement that there is a sense of growing concern and dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs in the field being referred to, most likely in the context of political, social, or economic topics within the European Union. The lack of progress and vague promises mentioned are not providing adequate reassurance or tangible results that the situation will improve or that meaningful policy changes are taking place. It can be inferred that the matter discussed could involve negotiations between various member states, politicians, and EU bodies struggling to find common ground or agree on new treaties and reforms. The reform treaty mentioned suggests that the issue may be related to how the European Union operates, organizes itself, or even sets its political agendas. One possibility is that this statement is addressing the ongoing debates surrounding EU political integration. Many European countries and their citizens have voiced their concerns both in favor and against this process. Those who support deeper political integration often argue that it would promote stronger unity, cooperation, and shared sovereignty among the member states, ultimately leading to greater political and economic stability. On the other hand, opponents to further integration argue that it could lead to a loss of national sovereignty and autonomy for EU countries. They may worry about the power being increasingly centralized in Brussels, which could potentially limit each country's decision-making and control over their own laws and policies. It is this complex and divisive subject that may be referred to in the statement. Moreover, this reluctance to advance EU reforms could also be attributed to the turbulent political climate in various member states in recent years. Shifts in political positions and voter sentiment reflect a diverse spectrum of opinions on the direction of the EU. As a result, reaching a consensus on essential political reforms and integrating such policies into a reform treaty is undoubtedly challenging. In conclusion, the statement highlights the lack of progress, policies, and clarity spanning across the European Union's political spectrum. As the integration and reform debates continue, it remains crucial for policymakers to engage with diverse opinions and concerns to ensure a balanced approach is taken, paving a way for meaningful and enduring improvements for the entire region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline.

Antennas more complex than the dipole or vertical designs are usually intended to increase the directivity and consequently the gain of the antenna. This can be accomplished in many different ways leading to a plethora of antenna designs. The vast majority of designs are fed with a balanced line (unlike a monopole antenna) and are based on the dipole antenna with additional components (or elements) which increase its directionality. Antenna \\"gain\\" in this instance describes the concentration of radiated power into a particular solid angle of space, as opposed to the spherically uniform radiation of the ideal radiator. The increased power in the desired direction is at the expense of that in the undesired directions. Power is conserved, and there is no net power increase over that delivered from the power source (the transmitter.) What is different from a monopole antenna with most other antenna types?","completion":"A monopole antenna is different from most other antenna types in several ways. Here is a detailed comparison and discussion of the major differences: 1. Structure and Design: A monopole antenna consists of a single, straight conductive element that is typically mounted vertically above a ground plane, which can be a conductive surface or a set of radials positioned symmetrically around the base of the antenna. On the other hand, many other antenna types, like dipoles, Yagi-Uda antennas, and log-periodic antennas, have more complex structures, with multiple conductive elements positioned in various configurations. 2. Balanced vs. Unbalanced Feed: Monopole antennas are fed with an unbalanced feedline, such as a coaxial cable, which connects the transmitter or receiver to the antenna. The ground plane or radial system serves as the return path for the current. In contrast, many other antenna types utilize balanced feedlines, like twin-lead or ladder line, which means that both conductors carry equal and opposite currents, effectively canceling out their electromagnetic fields. 3. Polarization: Monopole antennas are predominantly vertically polarized, meaning that the electric field component of the radiated wave oscillates in a plane perpendicular to the Earth's surface. Most other antenna types can be designed for either vertical or horizontal polarization, which refers to the orientation of the electric field component of the radiated wave being parallel to the Earth's surface. 4. Radiation Pattern: A monopole antenna has an omnidirectional radiation pattern in the horizontal plane, radiating equal amounts of power in all azimuthal directions. Many other antenna types, such as Yagi-Uda antennas and parabolic reflector antennas, have directional radiation patterns, focusing the radiated power into a narrow beam to achieve higher gain and directivity. 5. Gain: Monopole antennas generally have lower gain compared to many other antenna types. Their simple design, omnidirectional radiation pattern, and reliance on a ground plane result in a less focused transmission or reception of radio waves. In contrast, more complex antenna designs, like Yagi-Uda antennas, phased arrays, and parabolic reflectors, achieve higher gain by concentrating the radiated power in a specific direction at the expense of other directions. 6. Efficiency: Monopole antennas can be less efficient than other antenna types if the ground plane or radial system is not adequately designed. The presence of a ground plane, particularly if it is small or poorly constructed, can lead to losses in the form of ground currents that result in reduced radiation efficiency. Most other antenna types, such as dipoles and loop antennas, do not rely on a ground plane and may offer more consistent performance. In summary, monopole antennas differ from most other antenna types primarily in their design, feed method, polarization, radiation pattern, gain, and efficiency. While their simplicity makes them ideal for certain applications, more complex antenna designs are often necessary to achieve higher directivity, gain, and efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"The last step of the process after the core is left depends on the mass of the star. At this point, the star's life can take one of the following paths: 1. White Dwarf formation: If the original star has a mass less than eight times that of our Sun, after shedding its outer layers as a planetary nebula, the exposed core evolves into a dense, hot stellar remnant called a white dwarf. The white dwarf is composed mainly of carbon and oxygen and is supported against gravitational collapse by electron degeneracy pressure. White dwarfs no longer undergo nuclear fusion, so they slowly cool down and lose their luminosity over time, eventually becoming a black dwarf. However, this process takes trillions of years, longer than the current age of the universe, so no black dwarfs are believed to exist yet. 2. Supernova and Neutron Star formation: If the original star has a mass between eight and twenty times that of our Sun, when the core collapses under its own gravity, it forms a neutron star. This core collapse triggers a violent explosion called a Type II supernova. The remaining dense core - the neutron star - is supported by neutron degeneracy pressure and consists mainly of neutrons. Neutron stars are incredibly dense, with a mass around 1.4 times that of our Sun but a diameter of only about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles). Neutron stars can also be observed as pulsars, rapidly rotating sources of electromagnetic radiation. 3. Supernova and Black Hole formation: If the original star has a mass more than twenty times that of our Sun, the core collapse also results in a supernova explosion. However, in this case, the core's mass is so great that even neutron degeneracy pressure cannot counteract the force of gravity, and it keeps collapsing until it forms a black hole. A black hole is a region in space with an intense gravitational force, where gravity is so strong that even light cannot escape. Black holes are characterized by their event horizon, which is the boundary from which anything inside cannot escape the gravitational pull. They play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies, with some massive black holes present at their centers. So, depending on the mass of the star, after the core is left, the last step of the process may involve the formation of a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Sheep Smarter than Thought London--Sheep, like turkeys and ostriches, are not considered the most clever animals. British scientists said last Wednesday humans may have underestimated the woolly creature. They could be much smarter than we think. Researchers at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, southern England, have shown that the animals have a good memory system and are extremely good at recognizing faces--which they think is a sure sign of intelligence. Behavioral scientist Keith Kendrick and his friends trained 20 sheep to recognize and distinguish 25 pairs of sheep faces and used electrodes to measure their brain activity , which showed they could remember 50 faces for up to two years . \\"If they can do that with faces, they have to have reasonable intelligence; otherwise, what is the point of having a system for remembering faces and not remembering anything else?\\" Kendrick said in an interview. So hours of seemingly mindless eating grass may not be so mindless after all. Kendrick believes sheep got their reputation as dumb (unable to speak, unintelligent) animals because they live in large groups and do not appear to have much individuality and are frightened of just about everything. \\"All animals, including humans, once they are frightened, don't tend to show signs of intelligent action,\\" he explained. In research reported in the science journal Nature, Kendrick and his team showed that sheep, like humans, have a specialized system in the brain which allows them to distinguish between many different faces which look extremely similar. \\"The most important finding (of the study) is that they are able , both from a behavioral point of view and from looking at the way the brain is organized , to remember a large number of individuals for a very long time,\\" said Kendrick. \\"It is a very strange system.

Here are possible answers to this question: - sewer - bathroom - glass - drain - behind the curtain I believe the correct choice is \\"sewer\\", here's why: A:","completion":"Water runoff overflow typically ends up in a \\"sewer\\", and here's why: When water is unable to absorb into the ground (for example during heavy rainfall or snowmelt), it becomes surface runoff. This runoff is directed away from property to prevent flooding and water damage. The infrastructure in place to manage this water usually involves a system of gutters, downspouts, graded landscapes, and drainage ditches that direct the water to local sewers. The sewers, also known as storm drains or storm sewers, are designed with this purpose in mind. They work by collecting and carrying away this excess water, mitigating the risk of localized flooding. While some runoff temporarily resides in drains or gutters, it eventually travels to the sewer system. The other options like the bathroom, glass, or behind the curtain, don't make much sense in this context as they are not typically directly involved in the path of water runoff overflow. It's important to note that in some regions, stormwater runoff will merge with other sewage before being treated at a wastewater treatment plant. But in other areas, the stormwater runoff is discharged into local bodies of water without any treatment, which is why it's essential to reduce pollutants in our runoff."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Naming the absolutely most pathetic piece of crap in cinematic history is not an easy task, candidates being so abundant, but Nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite ever since I saw it. It was so funny we had to rent it again the next day, and again I laughed so hard I was literally rolling on the floor.

The hero has the same name, but this time \\"Alex\\" is female, although it took us half way into the movie to stop guessing, what with all the muscles and the barbarian-nomad outfit! There is really no plot at all, it's merely a prolonged chase scene, only it's so slow-paced and senseless that calling it a chase scene makes it sound way more interesting than it really is.

Movie plot title: Pirates of Silicon Valley Movie plot: Steve Jobs (Noah Wyle) is speaking with director Ridley Scott (J. G. Hertzler), about the creation of the 1984 commercial for Apple Computer, which introduced the first Macintosh. Jobs is trying to convey his idea that \\"We're creating a completely new consciousness.\\" Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the commercial. Next in 1997 with Jobs, returning to Apple, and announcing a new deal with Microsoft at the 1997 Macworld Expo. His partner, Steve Wozniak or \\"WOZ\\" (Joey Slotnick), is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall) on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they \\"got from there to here,\\" the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple. The earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the U.C. Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \\"Those guys think they're revolutionaries. They're not revolutionaries, we are.\\" Wozniak then comments that \\"Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see kilobytes or circuit boards while he'd see karma or the meaning of the universe. Using a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at Harvard University, in the early 1970s, with classmate Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio), and Gatesâ high school friend Paul Allen (Josh Hopkins). As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates' story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of Ed Roberts's MITS Altair causing him to drop out of Harvard.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Critics say Trump's call with Taiwan may alter decades of foreign policy The political fallout from Donald Trump’s phone call with Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen continued on Saturday, as critics said the president-elect could be paving the way to an alteration of decades of US foreign policy. “This may make for great reality TV,” one Democratic member of the Senate foreign relations committee said, “but it doesn’t make for great leadership in a divided world.” The senator, Chris Coons of Delaware, said it was “concerning” that Trump’s way of governing might mirror the “shoot-from-the-hip style” in which he campaigned for the White House. Trump, Coons said, had to decide whether he would continue to “[get] into Twitter fights or take unscheduled calls from foreign leaders in ways that break with decades of precedent”. The alternative, he said, was for the president-elect to rely “on the advice of career professionals and the state department and make moves in a calculated and thoughtful way”. Hours after Trump’s call became public knowledge on Friday, the Chinese government issued a complaint. “We have noticed relevant reports and lodged solemn representation with the relevant side in the United States,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement. “I must point out that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of the Chinese territory ... The ‘one China’ principle is the political foundation of China-US relations.” A spokesman for the Obama administration declined to comment on the complaint. Trump’s call with Tsai was the first publicly reported between a US president or president-elect and a leader of Taiwan since Washington established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979. The US subsequently severed ties with the island, which is viewed by Beijing as a breakaway province. Trump sought to stem the backlash resulting from the call by noting on Twitter it was the Taiwanese president who had called him. But he was rebuked for the call by foreign policy experts, who raised concerns about his propensity to behave unpredictably. Christopher Hill, former assistant secretary of state for east Asia and Pacific affairs under George W Bush, said Trump had broken a 40-year tradition in one clear policy related to China. “Obviously, it was an example of what is all too often happening now with this incoming administration, this tendency to wing it,” Hill told CNN on Friday evening. He added his concern that Trump’s team would double down on the decision, as opposed to acknowledging the misstep. “That’s a huge mistake,” Hill said. “And this is not going to be the last of these kind of things. So, things need to get … cleaned up in a hurry in Washington.” The Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, another Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, criticized Trump in a series of tweets late on Friday. “Foreign policy consistency is a means, not an end. It’s not sacred. Thus, it’s Trump’s right to shift policy, alliances, strategy,” Murphy wrote. America’s allies, Murphy said, would “have no clue” what the country stood for if the conversation did not represent a genuine change in foreign policy but simply a temporary deviation at Trump’s behest. The senator further underscored the need for Trump to nominate a secretary of state, “preferably [with] experience”. In his defense, Trump tweeted: “Interesting how the US sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.” His transition team described the conversation in a statement as a discussion “of the close economic, political and security ties that exist between Taiwan and the United States”, in which the president-elect also congratulated Tsai on her election earlier this year. The Taiwanese president characterized the phone call as an “intimate and relaxed conversation” that lasted 10 minutes. A translation of a statement posted on an official Taiwanese government website said Trump and Tsai broached topics including the domestic economy and national defense, and “allowing the people better lives and a guarantee of security”. “The two briefly exchanged opinions on the situation in the Asia region,” the statement read. Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump aide, pushed back on the notion that Trump did not grasp the implications of taking the phone call. “He either will disclose or not disclose the full contents of that conversation but he’s well aware of what US policy has been,” she told CNN. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Donald Trump's recent phone call with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has caused people to worry that Trump might change the way the United States has been dealing with other countries for a very long time. China, a big and powerful country, was not happy about this phone call because they think Taiwan is a part of China, and the United States has agreed with them since 1979. Critics say that Trump needs to be more careful with how he talks to leaders of other countries and listen to advice from people who know about these things. Trump said that Taiwan's president called him to say congratulations and he just wanted to be friendly by taking the call."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

First, we have a puzzle to solve: 1453 - 2417. We're going to subtract 2417 from 1453, but we're going to need some help from the \\"borrowing\\" technique. Here's how it looks: 1 4 5 3 - 2 4 1 7 ___________ After borrowing: 1 3 15 3 - 2 4 1 7 ____________ Now, we can subtract: 1 3 15 3 - 2 4 1 7 ____________ -964 So 1453 - 2417 = -964. Now let's look at the rest of the problem. We have: -964 = 173 * z + 2885 + 995. Let's add the two numbers on the right side (2885 + 995). We can stack them up like this: 2885 + 995 ________ 3880 Now our problem looks like this: -964 = 173 * z + 3880. To make the problem easier to solve, we'll keep z on one side and move all the other numbers to the other side. To do that, let's subtract 3880 from both sides. Add -3880 to both sides: -964 -3880 _______ -4844 Now we have -4844 = 173 * z. To find the value of z, let's divide both sides by 173. It would look like this: (-4844) ÷ 173 = z.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes. It would be their final conversation. Question: \\"What was a slight issue that affected the terrorists on the day?\\" Response: \\"Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS, meaning his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. An experimental drug compound is showing promise against the virus that causes AIDS. Scientists from the Scripps Research Institute in Florida, Harvard Medical School and more than a dozen other institutions developed the novel drug candidate and tested it in rhesus macaques, monkeys which can carry simian HIV, a virus similar to the one that infects humans. They found that macaques inoculated with the drug compound known as eCD4-lg did not catch the virus, even when they were repeatedly exposed to high levels of it over an 8-month period. Results of the study were published today in the journal Nature. In addition to protecting monkeys, the researchers say lab tests indicate the drug candidate blocks every known strain of HIV-1 and HIV-2, the two main types of the virus that infect humans. \\"Our compound is the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far,\\" lead researcher Michael Farzan, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute, said in a press statement. \\"Unlike antibodies, which fail to neutralize a large fraction of HIV-1 strains, our protein has been effective against all strains tested, raising the possibility it could offer an effective HIV vaccine alternative.\\" It was built on previous research by Farzan's lab into a receptor called CCR5, which plays a key role in enabling HIV to latch onto the surface of a cell and begin replicating. The new drug compound binds to two sites on the surface of the virus simultaneously, preventing it from infecting a cell. \\"This is the culmination of more than a decade's worth of work on the biochemistry of how HIV enters cells,\\" Farzan said. \\"When we did our original work on CCR5, people thought it was interesting, but no one saw the therapeutic potential. That potential is starting to be realized.\\" To work like a vaccine, the researchers attached eCD4-lg to an adeno-associated virus (AAV), a virus harmless to humans that can be used as a vehicle. Noted AIDS researcher David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate whose firm, Calimmune, is working on a separate gene therapy approach to HIV, told Science he considers these latest findings \\"impressive.\\" But he sounded a note of caution since it's only been tested in a laboratory and in animals. \\"It's perhaps a better construct than the antibodies we've been using, but it's a matter of how it plays out in human trials,\\" Baltimore said. \\"I don't think it's easy to tell how that will happen.\\" ||||| A new study could lead to the first step in new treatments for patients with AIDS and an alternative to a vaccine against HIV. Scripps Institute’s Michael Farzan explains. Photo: AP Scientists have engineered a molecule they say can block infection with the virus that causes AIDS, a discovery that potentially could lead to a new therapy for patients as well as an alternative to a vaccine. Researchers have been trying for three decades to develop an effective vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. They are also searching for a way to cure infected people. But the ever-evolving virus has eluded them. ... ||||| The author, Michael Farzan, an infectious disease specialist at the Scripps Research Institute in Florida, described the new compound as “the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far.” It is simpler and works better, he said, than the current method that scientists are experimenting with: giving monkeys cocktails of several different antibodies that each neutralize only one or two strains of H.I.V., sometimes imperfectly. Blocking H.I.V. A new protein may be able to block H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, from entering and infecting human cells. Envelope protein CCR5 binding site New protein blocks both sites H.I.V. CD4 binding site Antibody blocks CD4 site CD4 CCR5 Cell INFECTING A CELL NORMAL ANTIBODIES AN ANTIBODY-LIKE PROTEIN H.I.V. is covered with small spikes that enable it to attach to two receptors, called CD4 and CCR5, on the surface of a target cell. Each spike has a three-lobed structure with two types of binding sites. Antibodies can block one type of site, but not both. A new protein resembling an antibody with a tail seems to block both sites, preventing the virus from binding to and entering the cell. Envelope protein H.I.V.

New protein blocks both sites AN ANTIBODY-LIKE PROTEIN A new protein resembling an antibody with a tail seems to block both sites, preventing the virus from binding to and entering the cell. The study was published online by the journal Nature. Describing over the telephone the way his new compound worked, Dr. Farzan said he was bending his hand into a claw, with his thumb representing the end blocking one site and two fingers blocking the other. “One of my colleagues told me it’s the grip for a two-seam cut fastball,” he said. The work was led by scientists at his institute but involved researchers from Harvard, Princeton, Rockefeller University, the University of Southern California, the Pasteur Institute in France and elsewhere. The next step, Dr. Farzan said, will be to test the compound in infected monkeys and see if it can stop the virus from replicating further, which is what antiretroviral medicines do. If that proves safe and effective, he said, he hopes to start human trials in three stages. In the first, humans would be injected every few weeks with just the antibody-like protein, not with the vector that stimulates muscle cells to produce it. If that were successful, the vector would be injected into humans who already have H.I.V. but are not taking antiretroviral pills because they refuse, forget or experience bad side effects. Finally, the compound would be given to healthy people at high risk — such as gay men who have frequent unprotected sex with strangers — to see if it protects them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The new approach uses cutting-edge techniques that are not widely known, or even entirely understood, by the scientists experimenting with them. Historically, vaccines have been made by killing or weakening whole viruses and injecting them; that stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that recognize and attack the real virus when it arrives. Photo Newer vaccines splice genes for particular antibodies into other weakened viruses. Generally, the genes are carried into a cell by the virus, incorporated into the cell’s genome, and begin producing the necessary antibodies. But this new method splices the desired gene into a stretch of DNA so short that it cannot function like a virus at all and does not deserve to be called one, Dr. Farzan said, who refers to it simply as “a gene therapy vector.” It does not integrate itself into the DNA of a cell or replicate itself. (Yet it is sometimes called an A.A.V., short for “adeno-associated virus,” even though that causes confusion, said Dr. Farzan.) Nonetheless, injecting that vector into muscle stimulates cells to produce the antibody-like protein encoded by the gene.

We’re not really able to answer that question,” Dr. Farzan said. “But it does.” H.I.V. normally targets CD4 cells, white blood cells that act as the sentinels of the immune system. The virus invades them by attaching its outer spikes — known as envelope proteins — to two different receptors on the outside of the cell. First it attaches to the CD4 receptor; that exposes the CCR5 receptor. Once attached to both, the virus can inject its RNA into the cell and hijack its inner machinery to produce more virus. But the protein produced by Dr. Farzan, bent into its claw shape, blocks both the CD4-binding site and the CCR5-binding site. It does so in a very tight “match” difficult for the virus to block by means of “escape mutations” — changes in shape that partly prevent engineered antibodies from attaching. “It fools the virus into thinking it’s interacting with a cell,” Dr. Farzan said. Dr. Philip R. Johnson, director of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute and the inventor of the vector that Dr. Farzan used, called the new approach “good stuff.” “It appears to be as good as, if not better than, anything else that’s being tried,” he said. Eventually, he said, he would like to see an approach that combined known antibodies and the new protein “so we could target two or three areas on the virus.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Scientists have created a new drug compound called eCD4-lg that shows promise in protecting against the virus that causes AIDS.

While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral. He begins tiring of Ripley, resenting his constant presence and suffocating dependence. Ripley's own feelings are complicated by his desire to maintain the opulent lifestyle Dickie has...

John Bruce \\"Jack\\" Thompson (born July 25, 1951) is an American activist and disbarred attorney, based in Coral Gables, Florida. Thompson is known for his role as an anti-video-game activist, particularly against violence and sex in video games. During his time as an attorney, Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture. This included rap music, broadcasts by shock jock Howard Stern, the content of computer and video games and their alleged effects on children. Thompson has heavily criticized a number of video games and campaigned against their producers and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as \\"murder simulators\\" to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games and a number of school massacres. According to Thompson, \\"In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers.\\" Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, \\"If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain.\\" Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as \\"Pearl Harbor 2\\". According to Thompson, \\"Many parents think that stores won't sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked.\\" Thompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by freedom of expression, saying, \\"Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They're not even speech. They're dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it,\\" as well as simply calling video games \\"mental masturbation\\". In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, saying that it was looking \\"for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end\\". Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller \\"gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill. This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner's laboratory.\\" Although his efforts dealing with video games have generally focused on juveniles, Thompson got involved in a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the \\"functional equivalent of a 15-year-old,\\" and \\"the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense\\". Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"One interesting aspect from the article is Thompson's perspective on the connection between video games and the military.

Hercules was once destined to be the King of Mycenae as his father Zeus had planned but his jealous stepmother Hera had other plans. Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene.

Q: The aim was to assess the effect of population-based mammography screening on treatment costs for fatal breast cancer in Turku, Finland.', 'The study included 556 women with invasive breast cancer, diagnosed at the age of 40-74 years in 1987-1993: 427 in the screened group (screen-detected or interval cancer) and 129 in the unscreened group (not yet invited or refused screening). Both groups were followed up for 8 years from diagnosis.', 'In the unscreened group, 32 (25%) patients died of breast cancer versus 49 (12%) in the screened group (p < 0.001). The non-discounted mean treatment costs were 2.8-fold for those dying of breast cancer compared to survivors: 26,222 euros versus 9,434 euros; the difference between means was 16,788 euros (95% CI 14,915-18,660) (p<0.001). The mean costs for fatal cases were high, irrespective of the way cancer was detected: 23,800 euros in the unscreened group versus 27,803 euros in the screened group; the difference between means was -4,003 euros (-10,810 to 2802) (p=0.245). In the unscreened group, patients with fatal breast cancer accounted for 41% (0.76/1.87 million euros) of the total treatment costs versus 29% (1.36/4.76 million euros) in the screened group. It was estimated that about one third of costs for fatal breast cancer were avoided through mammography screening, accounting for 72-81% of the estimated total treatment cost savings achieved by screening. About 31-35% of the screening costs for 1987 to 1993 were offset by savings in treatment costs.

Which building had fewer people that had Alzheimer's? two buildings had different tenants. Building Y had many seniors over 65 years of age, and building X had individuals under 65 years old. Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. The answer is:","completion":"Building X had fewer people that had Alzheimer's. The paragraph states that Building Y had many seniors over 65 years of age, while Building X had individuals under 65 years old. It also mentions that old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life, and during this period, the number of brain cells decreases, leading to a higher risk of diseases such as Alzheimer's.

Please briefly summarize this news article: A San Francisco Couple Domesticates a Former Warehouse Matthew Millman for The New York Times Clive McCarthy and Tricia Bell's San Francisco home. More Photos » WHEN it comes to life decisions, Clive McCarthy doesn’t shy away from grand leaps. The British-born electrical engineer was near the peak of a long career in Silicon Valley, where he directed chip and software design for the semiconductor company Altera, when he went in an entirely new direction. In 1997, around the time he turned 51, he took a few years off and then enrolled in art school. Then he began staging public performances with live avant-garde music and teams of painters who executed the large images he envisioned, and later he started devising art-producing algorithms, using TVs and computer monitors as dynamic “canvases” for his work. He also began dating Tricia Bell, a physician. In 2005, four months into their courtship, Mr. McCarthy showed her blueprints for his future home and studio in the city’s Mission district. When Dr. Bell, now 59, asked about a space labeled “Tricia’s Room,” he explained, “It’s a room you can transform however you please.” And if she ever became peeved with him, he told her, “it can be your little retreat.” It was a bold move so early in their relationship. But, he recalled, “I was already certain how I felt about Tricia, and I needed to make my intentions known.\\" Dr. Bell, who is now his wife, was charmed. The gritty fringe neighborhood where he had bought a 10,000-square-foot structure wasn’t where he had first planned to settle, but his efforts to build a contemporary home on upscale Russian Hill had met opposition. So when he unexpectedly found this 1925 concrete building amid auto body shops, he took the leap, buying it for 2.3 million. Originally a Lucky Strike cigarette warehouse, it had also been the home of Capp Street Project, an organization known for its experimental art installations in the basilica-like main hall, a vast concrete room rising 24 feet to a pitched skylighted roof. Ann Hamilton once blanketed the floor there with 750,000 honey-dipped pennies, Bill Viola installed an indoor redwood forest and Carl Cheng flooded the room like a swimming pool. The next owner had carved up the space, though, so Mr. McCarthy was unaware of the building’s art world provenance. But Stanley Saitowitz, the designer he hired to renovate it, remembered the warehouse from its Capp Street days and set about reclaiming it as a place for making art. “Clive gave us a pretty open canvas,” Mr. Saitowitz said. “We wanted to create emptiness: a playground for his experiments, for all the different things he works on simultaneously.” The idea was to restore the openness and rawness of the space by peeling away dropped ceilings, paneling and partitions, and then to insert into that rough setting “little jewels or set pieces,” he said, meaning discrete rooms or objects with greater refinement and intimacy. Now, where redwoods once soared, a spiral stairway encased in steel rods rises to a roof garden. Mr. McCarthy’s studio takes center stage in the big central space, where his “Electric Paintings” morph and regenerate on skeletal screens. One level up, on the original perimeter mezzanine, Mr. Saitowitz created pockets of domesticity, like a huge master bath lined in pristine white tile with a rain feature. In the open kitchen, a 39-foot silvery granite work island doubles as a dining table. Dr. Bell said she has never needed to retreat, peeved, into “Tricia’s Room,” but she has transformed it with a green wall like the one in the bedroom that recalls Mr. Viola’s redwoods. Meanwhile, the creative spirit of the building’s earlier days has spontaneously seeped back. Artist friends gather for group critiques, and when the couple invites avant-garde ensembles to rehearse or perform, the whole place resonates with music.","completion":"Clive McCarthy and Tricia Bell, a San Francisco-based couple, transformed a former warehouse into their home and studio.

Step 1: Consider the factors that may change the color of coconut water. Some possible factors include the presence of antioxidants, exposure to air, or changes in temperature. Step 2: Identify the most likely cause for the change in the user's coconut water. A likely cause is the presence of antioxidants called polyphenols in the coconut water. These antioxidants can sometimes react with enzymes present in the water, causing a pink color change. Step 3: Offer the user assurance and additional information relevant to the pink color. Pink coconut water is not harmful and is completely safe to consume. The change in color is a natural process and does not affect the nutritional value or taste of the water. 2. Is coconut water useful for digestion? Step 1: Review the properties of coconut water. Coconut water is known for its electrolytes, potassium, and low sugar content, making it a popular natural refreshment. Step 2: Identify how these properties can affect digestion. Coconut water can have a positive effect on digestion, as it is rich in electrolytes and is hydrating. This can help regulate bowel movements and prevent dehydration, which can lead to constipation. Step 3: Provide a summarizing statement for the user. Yes, coconut water can be beneficial for digestion due to its hydrating nature and electrolyte content. 3.

A large orange dog is running through the grass by the water. From this detail, we know there is a dog, it is large and orange, and is running near the water. We also know that the area has grass. However, we cannot ascertain if the dog is fetching a stick or involved in any other specific activity. 2. There is a large boat sailing in the background. This statement suggests that there is a body of water large enough to accommodate sailing activities of a large boat. This indirectly implies that the body of water could be a lake, sea, or even an ocean. However, we cannot confirm with certainty that it is specifically a large lake. In order to conclude that \\"A dog is fetching a stick near a large lake,\\" we would need more information directly related to the dog's activity and the nature of the body of water. It is possible that the scenario could be \\"A dog is fetching a stick near a large lake,\\" but we do not have enough information from the original statement to confirm this conclusively. We can, however, partially agree with the statement by concluding that \\"A large orange dog is running through the grass near a body of water, where a large boat is sailing.\\" This statement is closer to the given information without making direct assumptions about the dog's activity or identifying the body of water as a large lake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

About 31 percent of Americans are now obese — roughly 30 or more pounds over a healthy weight . Pick your answer from: --no. --yes....I think the answer is","completion":"No, these two sentences do not mean the same thing, although they might seem similar at first glance since both discuss obesity and being 30 pounds over a healthy weight. The first sentence is specifically talking about the age group of \\"twentysomethings,\\" which typically refers to individuals in their twenties. It states that about 22% of people within this age group are obese, meaning they are approximately 30 pounds over a healthy weight. The second sentence discusses obesity within the entire American population, without specifying any particular age group. It states that about 31% of Americans are obese, which is also defined as being roughly 30 or more pounds over a healthy weight. While both sentences address the issue of obesity, the key difference lies in the demographic being discussed. The first sentence focuses on people in their twenties, while the second sentence refers to the entire American population.

See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: Not if you keep your voice down. Sentence 2: There are people listening all around us. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? pick from the following. (a). yes. (b). it is not possible to tell. (c). no.","completion":"(b). it is not possible to tell. In order to fully explain the answer, let's break down each sentence and look at the information they provide. Sentence 1: \\"Not if you keep your voice down.\\" This sentence implies that something will not happen or will not be an issue if the person being spoken to keeps their voice down. It is a conditional statement based upon the action of keeping the voice down. Sentence 2: \\"There are people listening all around us.\\" This sentence is a claim that there are people in the surrounding area who are paying attention to the conversation or noise being generated. This sentence does not depend on the first sentence, and it is presented as a fact. Now, let's consider the question: \\"If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?\\" The question is asking if the truth of the first statement (the need to keep one's voice down) guarantees the truth of the second statement (that there are people listening around). While Sentence 1 suggests that there may be a reason to be cautious of people overhearing the conversation, it does not guarantee the presence of listeners all around. It is possible that there are listeners, but Sentence 1 doesn't directly confirm their existence in its current form. The first sentence could be true because there might be specific reasons or situations where one needs to keep their voice down (e.g., discussing sensitive information), but this does not necessarily mean that there are people actively listening all around. Therefore, the correct response is (b). It is not possible to tell if the second sentence is true based solely on the truth of the first sentence. The two sentences, as they are presented, do not provide enough information to definitively establish a direct causal relationship between them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, we can combine the numbers on the left side of the equation and combine the numbers on the right side of the equation. So, the sum of 3574 and 12497 is 16071. The right side of the equation can be simplified as well, although there's only one number and another term that includes variable 'k'. Thus, the equation becomes: 16071 = -530k - 6189 The next step is to isolate the term with variable 'k' on one side of the equation. This can be done by adding 6189 from both sides of the equation: 16071 + 6189 = -530k - 6189 + 6189 This simplifies to: 22260 = -530k The equation now has 'k' on one side, but it’s tied up in multiplication with -530. This relationship can be broken by doing the inverse operation, i.e., dividing both sides by -530: 22260 / -530 = -530k / -530 This further simplifies to: -42 = k Therefore, the solution to the equation is k = -42."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the person who dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na? ? The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded as having arrived in 166 AD by the Book of the Later Han. The embassy came to Emperor Huan of Han China from \\"Andun\\" (Chinese: 安敦; Emperor Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus), \\"king of Daqin\\" (Rome). As Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD, leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and the envoy arrived in 166 AD, confusion remains about who sent the mission, as both emperors were named \\"Antoninus\\". The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by sea), entering China by the frontier of Rinan or Tonkin (present-day Vietnam). It brought presents of rhinoceros horns, ivory, and tortoise shell, probably acquired in Southern Asia. The text states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries. Yule speculated that the Roman visitors must have lost their original wares due to robbery or shipwreck and used the gifts instead, prompting Chinese sources to suspect them of withholding their more precious valuables, which Yule notes was the same criticism directed at papal missionary John of Montecorvino when he arrived in China in the late 13th century AD. Historians Rafe de Crespigny, Peter Fibiger Bang, and Warwick Ball believe that this was most likely a group of Roman merchants rather than official diplomats sent by Marcus Aurelius. Crespigny stresses that the presence of this Roman embassy as well as others from Tianzhu (in northern India) and Buyeo (in Manchuria) provided much-needed prestige for Emperor Huan, as he was facing serious political troubles and fallout for the forced suicide of politician Liang Ji, who had dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na. Yule emphasised that the Roman embassy was said to come by way of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam, the same route that Chinese sources claimed the embassies from Tianzhu (northern India) had used in 159 and 161 AD.

Answer the following question: when was mercaptan first added to natural gas?","completion":"Mercaptan, also known as thiols, is a sulfur-containing organic compound that is commonly added to natural gas as an odorant. The primary reason for adding these compounds to natural gas is to give it a distinct and recognizable smell. Natural gas in its original form is colorless and odorless, which makes detecting leaks quite difficult. The characteristic \\"rotten egg\\" smell of mercaptan facilitates quick detection of gas leaks, thus helping prevent any possible accidents or explosions. The practice of adding an odorant to natural gas has its origins dating back to the 1930s. A tragic event on March 18, 1937, forever changed how natural gas would be distributed and utilized. The New London School in Texas, USA, experienced a devastating natural gas explosion that led to the death of nearly 300 students and teachers. The explosion was caused by an undetected gas leak that accumulated in the building's basement. Following the New London School explosion, a state law was enacted, mandating that all natural gas must be odorized so as to be easily detected in case of leaks. Consequently, the idea of using mercaptan as an odorant for natural gas gained momentum. The first use of mercaptan as an odorant was around 1937, in the United States. Researchers began developing various odorants based on the mercaptan family of compounds, with the most common variant being tert-butyl mercaptan (TBM) and ethyl mercaptan (EM). Over time, advancements in mercaptan odorant development led to other odorants for natural gas, like mixtures of methyl ethyl and tertiary butyl mercaptans, becoming common. In summary, while the exact date might not be universally agreed upon, the use of mercaptan as an odorant for natural gas commenced around 1937, in reaction to the New London School explosion in Texas, USA. This significant event prompted critical changes to natural gas delivery systems, a move that has undoubtedly saved numerous lives and prevented numerous disasters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film opens by cutting back and forth between scenes of a naval ship carrying Admiral Croft (John Woodvine), and a buggy carrying Mr. Shepherd (David Collings) and his daughter Mrs. Clay (Felicity Dean) to Kellynch Hall. Shepherd and Clay are accosted by creditors due to the debts owed by the residence's owner, Sir Walter Elliot (Corin Redgrave), while Croft discusses the end of the Napoleonic Wars with fellow men of the navy. Sir Walter, a vain foppish baronet, is faced with financial ruin unless he retrenches. Though Sir Walter initially opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to temporarily move to Bath while the hall is let; the idea came from Shepherd, family friend Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood), and Sir Walter's second eldest daughter, the intelligent Anne (Amanda Root). Anne is visibly upset upon learning that the new tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft, who is the brother-in-law of Frederick Wentworth (CiarÃ¡n Hinds)âa naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage nine years previously because of his lack of prospects and connections. Wentworth is now wealthy from serving in the Wars, and has returned to England, presumably to find a wife. Later, Anne expresses to Lady Russell her unhappiness at her family's current financial predicament, and her past decision to reject the captain's proposal of marriage. Anne visits her other sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), a hypochondriac who has married into a local farming family. Anne patiently listens to the various complaints confided in her by each of the Musgrove family; this includes Mary's husband Charles, sisters-in-law Louisa (Emma Roberts) and Henrietta (Victoria Hamilton), and parents-in-law Mr and Mrs Musgrove (Roger Hammond and Judy Cornwell). Captain Wentworth comes to dine with the Musgroves, but Anne avoids going when she volunteers to nurse Mary's injured son.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether the Head can be hindered by what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, hindering introduces hindrances that obstruct the natural path to the achievement of a goal.

Solution:","completion":"Yes Explanation: The definition of hindering is to obstruct the natural path to the achievement of a goal. In this case, PersonX's goal is to make peace, but the tail mentions that PersonX's dad hits him if he talks. This physical action of his dad hitting him acts as a hindrance or obstacle in him making peace, as it may prevent him from expressing himself or having a conversation in order to make peace.

Linet climbs a tree over a river and nearly falls. She calls for help. but recovers and makes it back to land. As she senses the Wolf watching her, she is discovered by a woodsman, Peter, who scolds her for being foolish. As they walk back, Peter asks Linet why she can't stay home and be a good little girl. Linet answers how good little girls hardly ever see the world (Lost in the Woods). When they arrive at the house, Lady Jean raises an eyebrow at Linet's disheveled condition. Linet apologizes, but tells her mother how she came close to actually seeing an elf; and if she doesn't look, then she'll never know for sure. As Lady Jean sends her inside to change, Peter comments to her how Linet is growing up and shows no fear. They then talk about how when her husband, Lord Percival, was in the castle, there was no danger. But since Percival's disappearance, his evil twin brother, Lord Godfrey, has taken over, and no one in the castle is safe, which is why Jean and Linet live in the country. As Jean stands, she suddenly sees Godfrey approaching, and Peter leaves. Godfrey notes to Jean that today was the day her husband went off to war, and it has been seven years since, meaning that she is legally free to remarry. He sternly implores that it is the right thing for Jean to marry him, but Jean flatly refuses and explains she still loves Percival. Godfrey wonders, as Percival's exact twin, how Jean could not love him when it is clear she doesn't. He offers her riches and beauty, by proposing to enable her to resume her role as lady of the castle, but she refuses. Godfrey loudly proclaims that, as far as he is concerned, she is the only candidate for lady of the castle, meaning that she WILL be his wife. answer the following question: What is the name of the person that came close to seeing an elf?

Select from: (1). yes; (2). no; Does \\"He began removing and appointing satraps as if he were king and also raided the royal treasuries in Ectabana, Persepolis and Susa, making off with 25,000 talents.\\" correctly answer the question of How many talents did Diadochi steal from Ectabana, Persepolis and Susa?","completion":"The sentence \\"He began removing and appointing satraps as if he were king and also raided the royal treasuries in Ectabana, Persepolis and Susa, making off with 25,000 talents.\\" does correctly answer the question: \\"How many talents did Diadochi steal from Ectabana, Persepolis, and Susa?\\" The appropriate response would be that Diadochi (referring to an unspecified individual among Diadochi, the successors of Alexander the Great) stole 25,000 talents from the royal treasuries in Ectabana, Persepolis, and Susa. To provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, it is necessary to look into the historical context of the events that unfolded. After the death of Alexander the Great, his vast empire was divided among his former generals, who were collectively known as Diadochi. These generals and their territories faced numerous conflicts and power struggles in the ensuing years, in their attempts to secure control and expand their realms. In the given sentence, an unspecified member of the Diadochi engaged in his own power play by appointing and removing satraps (provincial governors) as though he were the king himself. This act highlights the individual's ambitions and goals of consolidating power and authority. In addition to manipulating the governance of the territories under his control, he also sought to increase his wealth and fund his military campaigns by raiding the royal treasuries of Ectabana, Persepolis, and Susa. These ancient cities were significant political and economic centers during the reign of Alexander the Great and his successors, and their treasuries would, undoubtedly, house immense wealth. By stealing 25,000 talents from these treasuries, the unnamed Diadochi member effectively gained a substantial sum that could be used to bolster his position and execute his objectives. In the silver coinage system prevalent in the Hellenistic period, one talent typically weighed around 26 kilograms (57 pounds). Therefore, the total stolen sum of 25,000 talents would be equivalent to around 650,000 kilograms (approximately 1,433,000 pounds) of silver. This immense fortune would certainly strengthen his standing and provide the necessary resources to pursue his ambitions. To summarize, the sentence in question does present the correct answer to the query about the number of talents stolen from the royal treasuries in Ectabana, Persepolis, and Susa by an unspecified member of the Diadochi. The actions of this individual, which included appointing and removing satraps and raiding the treasuries, were aimed at consolidating power and wealth to advance his position among the rival factions in the ensuing struggles and conflicts that marked the time period after Alexander the Great's death."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],j={key:0},N={key:1};function E(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
