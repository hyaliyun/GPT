Premise: \\"um-hum yeah the rear brakes just doing the just putting the brake pads in wouldn't be too expensive but it's when while you're in the front that you usually go ahead and pull those\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The expense of replacing brake pads isn't just the cost of adding the new ones.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, it can be inferred that the hypothesis \\"The expense of replacing brake pads isn't just the cost of adding the new ones\\" is true. The speaker in the premise is pointing out that simply putting new brake pads in the rear brakes wouldn't be too expensive on its own. However, they also mention that when working on the front brakes, technicians usually go ahead and pull other components, which can add to the total service cost. To further explore this hypothesis, we can analyze the various factors that contribute to the cost of replacing brake pads. 1. Labor Cost: Replacing brake pads involves dismantling the brake system, removing the old pads, and then installing the new ones. This process requires skilled mechanics and labor. Skilled workers charge for their time and expertise, which can significantly influence the final cost of the service. 2. Brake Pad Material: Brake pads come in various types and materials, such as organic, ceramic, and semi-metallic. The choice of material can affect the overall cost, as some materials like ceramic are more expensive than others, like organic. Upgrading to a higher quality material for better performance can increase the cost of replacing brake pads. 3. Rotor Resurfacing or Replacement: In some cases, when changing the brake pads, it might be necessary to resurface or even replace the brake rotors. This could be due to excessive wear, uneven surface, or warping that can affect braking performance. Resurfacing or replacing the brake rotors increases the total expense of the brake pad replacement process. 4. Additional Services: As mentioned in the premise, while servicing the front brakes, mechanics might go ahead and pull other components. This could involve inspections, flushes, or replacements of brake fluid, caliper service, or checking brake lines. These additional services, while potentially necessary, can add to the overall cost of replacing brake pads. 5. Vehicle Complexity: Different vehicle models have varying levels of complexity when it comes to their braking systems. Luxury and high-performance cars, for instance, may use more intricate designs or advanced materials, which can make the brake pad replacement process more involved and expensive compared to simpler and more common vehicle systems. In conclusion, based on the premise and the contributing factors mentioned above, the hypothesis \\"The expense of replacing brake pads isn't just the cost of adding the new ones\\" is true. The overall cost of replacing brake pads is affected by various factors such as labor cost, brake pad material, rotor resurfacing or replacement, additional services, and vehicle complexity. These factors combine to determine the final expense of not only replacing the brake pads but also addressing any additional maintenance requirements to ensure the effective function of the brake system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Boundaries are important in any type of relationship. Enforcing boundaries with a friend can be challenging, but it will ultimately benefit you and help you build stronger friendships. If your friend can’t respect your boundaries, it may be time to distance yourself from them. A few ways you can set boundaries include: Letting your friend know that you will not tolerate gossip or belittling speech about you to others. Saying “no” if your friend insists on talking about something personal or gossiping about others in front of you. Setting consequences for when your friend violates your boundaries (e.g., “If you keep talking about me behind my back, I will not spend time with you anymore.”). If you’ve talked to your friend and they’re making an effort to change their ways, give them a few weeks or months before making any big decisions about the friendship. Your friend may be trying to change a lifelong habit of blurting things out when they don’t mean to, for example. If your friend does slip up, remind them that they agreed not to gossip to or about you. If they apologize and immediately correct their behavior, that’s a good sign that they are trying to improve. Make sure your friend knows that what you are telling them is private and for no one else to know, if you are intent on sharing personal information with them. You may find out that you can’t trust them, but at least they won’t be able to claim that they “didn’t know it was a secret.” If your friend can’t stop gossiping and it’s causing you significant stress, then it might be best to go your separate ways. Try keeping them as an acquaintance at first, to see if spending less time around them alleviates the problem. If things don’t improve, tell them that you cannot be friends with someone that you cannot trust.","completion":"Boundaries are crucial in fostering healthy relationships, including friendships. Establishing and enforcing these limits can be difficult but necessary in maintaining strong connections with others. When a friend is unable to respect your established boundaries, considering distancing yourself may be appropriate. Some essential steps you can take to set boundaries and protect your friendships include addressing gossip and negative speech, assertively saying \\"no\\" to conversations that infringe on your personal limits, and implementing consequences for violations of your boundaries. By clearly communicating your expectations, you allow your friend the chance to modify their behavior and show that they respect and value the friendship. It is important to be patient with your friend as they work on changing habits that have potentially been ingrained in them for a long time. If they make mistakes but correct their actions and genuinely apologize, this reveals their commitment to bettering the friendship. When sharing confidential information, be clear with your friend that you trust them with this intimate knowledge and that it should not be disseminated to others. However, if your friend continuously disregards your boundaries despite your efforts, it may be necessary to reassess your relationship with them. Initially, try reducing the time spent together, potentially downgrading the friendship to an acquaintance level to see if the problem persists. If no improvements are observed and you still feel that you cannot trust them, it may be time to end the friendship to preserve your own well-being. Overall, boundaries are an integral aspect of healthy relationships, and while enforcing them can be challenging, doing so ultimately results in stronger and more fulfilling friendships. By setting clear expectations, monitoring your friend's efforts to change, and prioritizing your own mental and emotional well-being, you can effectively manage and navigate your friendships and establish trust and respect with those around you."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article that answers the following question: What did the Ottomans attack before July of 1686?","completion":"Title: The Ottoman Empire: Conquests Leading Up to July 1686 Introduction The Ottoman Empire, a powerful and geopolitical force that spanned over six centuries, had a significant impact on the world throughout its existence. Built on a disciplined and dynamic military force, the Ottomans conquered vast territories across the European, Asian, and African continents, as well as numerous islands in the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Black seas. This article delves into the history of the empire and examines the major conquests and military campaigns led by the Ottomans before July 1686. Byzantine Empire and the Rise of the Ottomans The Ottoman Empire's origins trace back to the late 13th century, when a Turkic tribal coalition led by Osman I established a small principality on the fringes of the crumbling Seljuk Empire in Anatolia. Under his reign, the Ottomans launched a series of military offensives westward against the stagnating Byzantine Empire. In 1326, the city of Bursa fell to the Ottomans, which became the new capital of the burgeoning state. By the mid-14th century, much of the Balkans, modern-day Greece, and parts of Bulgaria became the Ottomans' prey. Mehmed II and the Fall of Constantinople In 1453, the momentous conquest of Constantinople by Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II marked the definitive end of the Byzantine Empire. This victory had a far-reaching impact on world history, as the Ottomans transformed the ancient city into their new capital, Istanbul. Not only did the fall of Constantinople expand the empire's sphere of influence into the heart of Europe, but it also sowed the seeds for further aggression, as seen with Mehmed II's subjugation of Serbia, Bosnia, and the Morea. The Expansion of the Empire Under the reign of Selim I (1512-1520), the Ottomans ventured further afield, laying claim to vast areas of the Middle East. The 1514 Battle of Chaldiran saw the Ottomans defeat the Safavid Empire, bringing most of modern-day Iran under Ottoman control. By 1517, the empire captured Cairo and annexed the Mamluk Sultanate, expanding the empire's realms to include Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. The rule of Suleiman the Magnificent (1520-1566) saw a proliferation of military campaigns across Europe, Asia, and Africa. The capture of Belgrade in 1521 and Rhodes in 1522 demonstrated the empire's strength in its European conquests. However, Suleiman's most notable battle for Europe was the Sieges of Vienna (1529 and 1683), leading the Habsburg Empire to struggle to defend its territories in Hungary and Austria. Attempts at Conquering Mediterranean Islands The Ottomans were fixated on claiming the strategic islands in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas. After the acquisition of Rhodes in 1522, which weakened the Knights Hospitaller, Cyprus was taken from the Venetians in 1571. However, the Battle of Lepanto in the same year ended in a disastrous Ottoman defeat at the hands of the Holy League, a coalition of Catholic maritime states, albeit temporarily stalling the empire's expansion. Campaigns in Central Europe: The Long War The Long War, also known as the Thirteen Years' War, lasted from 1593 to 1606 between the Habsburg Empire and the Ottoman Empire. This conflict spanned across regions such as Hungary, Croatia, and Wallachia. Despite significant destructive campaigns, neither side was able to achieve lasting territorial gains. The war's conclusion saw the Treaty of Zsitvatorok, which ultimately maintained the territorial integrity of both empires. Conclusion The Ottomans' aggressive expansion through Europe, Asia, and Africa was driven by masterful military prowess, a sophisticated structure of governance, and a sustained desire for conquest. In the centuries leading up to July 1686, the empire achieved significant milestones, including the conquest of Constantinople, the annexation of the Mamluk Sultanate, and countless other campaigns. These conquests set the stage for the Ottoman Empire's continued struggle with Europe's greatest powers throughout the 17th and 18th centuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Asked if the Real Madrid star's challenge had been late, O'Shea, who will now miss Tuesday's friendly against Iceland, said: \\"Maybe, but thankfully I'm walking away from it, which is no problem. \\"I can't remember how many stitches it was. The doctor had to stick some in deep and a few dissolvable ones on top. Hopefully it will heal quickly.\\" The Sunderland defender was caught high and late by Bale, who received a yellow card for the sliding challenge in the goalless draw at the Aviva Stadium. Wales boss Chris Coleman later launched a passionate defence of both Bale and Neil Taylor, who was sent off for his foul on Seamus Coleman, and O'Shea said he had \\"no problem\\" with physical challenges. He said: \\"When you're playing England, Scotland or Wales, the games are going to be like that. They are the games you want to be involved in. \\"As the opposition manager, you're going to protect your own players. In a derby game, you're going to expect some tasty tackles - but, as I said, within reason. \\"There's no problem getting a hard tackle - but if it's late, it's a different story.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device O'Shea was significantly more fortunate than Coleman, who faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines after undergoing surgery on Saturday. The Republic were disappointed not to have made their numerical advantage count during the final 20 minutes or so of the game as Serbia replaced them at the top of Group D on goal difference. However given that they had gone into it without Robbie Brady, Shane Duffy, Ciaran Clark, James McCarthy, Harry Arter, Wes Hoolahan and Daryl Murphy, there was no sense of despondency in the Republic ranks. \\"If you gave us this position at the start of the group, we'd have taken it,\\" added O'Shea, who won his 117th cap in Friday's game.","completion":"In a recent match between the Republic of Ireland and Wales, Republic captain Seamus Coleman suffered a double leg fracture. John O'Shea, another player and the Sunderland defender, also had a close shave in the same match, requiring stitches for a shin wound. The physical intensity of the game led to concerns about player safety, but O'Shea stated that he had no problem with hard tackles, as they are to be expected in derby games. However, he did emphasize that late tackles carried a different set of issues. Despite the injuries sustained and the match's goalless draw, Republic players expressed no despondency, as they maintain their competitive position in the group."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: If you have a chance to go to Taiwan, there's one place you should not miss-- the Taipei Palace Museum. The museum has around 650,000 pieces of ancient Chinese treasures. These treasures were originally in the Palace Museum in Beijing. But how did they get to Taiwan? In 1931, the Japanese invaded the northeast part of China. To protect the national treasures from the Japanese, the government of the Republic of China decided to move some important pieces to Nanjing. However, they did not stay long in Nanjing. In 1949, the people's Liberation Army won in the Liberation War. The Guomindang government went from Nanjing to Taiwan. Along with them they took the art pieces. The Taipei Palace Museum was set up in 1965 to hold the national treasures. Taiwan people are very proud of the Taipei Palace Museum. Some of the collections are world famous. One of the most visited art pieces in the museum is the \\"Jade Cabbage\\". It is made from a single piece of jade . If you take a close look, you can see two grasshoppers on the leaves, a large one and a small one, which were the symbol of many children in a family. If you are interested in the treasures, you could take a look at a TV programme called Taipei Palace Museum. It gives a picture of the treasures of the Taipei Palace Museum. There are also interviews with over a hundred experts about the stories behind some of the pieces. Question: The treasures stayed in Nanjing for about _ years. Options: A: 10 B: 16 C: 18 D: 34","completion":"To answer the question, let's focus on the information provided in the article about the timeline of when the treasures were moved. The article mentions that the treasures were moved to Nanjing in 1931 to protect them from the Japanese invaders. Then it states that in 1949, they were moved again from Nanjing to Taiwan. To calculate the duration the treasures stayed in Nanjing, we can subtract 1931 from 1949. 1949 - 1931 = 18 So the treasures stayed in Nanjing for about 18 years.

Especially he is interested in treating children. One day he saw two children, child M and child N, and found child M is infected with Acute Hepatitis B while child N is infected with Chronic Hepatitis B. Next day he saw two other children, child O and child P. Child O was younger, but child P was older. Did child N had long term illness or short term illness? Hint: Hepatitis B is a contagious virus that affects the liver, infection can last from a few weeks to a serious lifelong illness. Two different types of infection exist for this disease, \\"acute\\" and \\"chronic.\\" Acute Hepatitis B is a short term illness that occurs within 6 months of exposure, Chronic Hepatitis B is long term and happens when the virus remains in the body. The younger the child is, the greater their chance of developing a chronic infection and this risk goes down as the child gets older. Approximately 90% of infected infants will develop a chronic infection.[3] A:","completion":"Child N had a long-term illness. The reasoning behind this answer is based on the information provided in the hint. As stated, Hepatitis B is a contagious virus that affects the liver. It can manifest as either an acute or chronic infection, with the acute infection lasting only a short period, specifically within six months of exposure. On the other hand, the chronic infection persists for a longer duration as the virus remains in the individual's body. Child N was found to be infected with Chronic Hepatitis B. As the hint indicates, the younger a child is when infected, the greater the chance they have of developing a chronic infection. In fact, approximately 90% of infected infants end up with a chronic infection. Given that Child N was already identified as having Chronic Hepatitis B, we can deduce that this child has a long-term illness, since chronic infections are generally prolonged in nature as opposed to their acute counterparts, which are considered short-term illnesses. Though it is not directly relevant to answering the original question, it is worth noting that Child M had Acute Hepatitis B, which makes their illness a short-term one, contrasting with Child N's chronic, long-term infection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the video that has the Tops of the Pops performance from the band that was featured on the Hype! documentary? , can you please find it? \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\").

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.

If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign.

Article: When Andrea Peterson landed her first teaching job, she faced the task of creating a music program with almost no money for equipment or supplies in a climate where standards-based learning was the focus and music just provided a break for students and teachers. For her drive and creativity in overcoming those challenges, she's been name national teacher of the year. Principal Waynes Kettler said he's worked with many outstanding teachers in his 22 years as an educator, but Peterson is \\"just that one step above anybody I've ever worked with before.\\" Kettler and others at Monte Cristo Elementary School talk about the ways she has introduced the learning from other classrooms into her music program and her creativity in working around things such as the lack of money for new music. When students were reading S.E. Hinton's novel in their regular classroom, Peterson helped them write a 30-minute play with scenes from the book. Then they chose three Broadway tunes that focused on race, equality and social justice, the themes of the book. Peterson composed two other sons herself after classroom discussions about the play and the book. The honor means a lot to residents of Granie Falls. It's inspiring to know that people from small towns can even win national honors. As national teacher of the year, Peterson will spend the next year outside classroom, as a national and international spokeswoman for education. Not surprisingly, she is a big believer in the value of arts education. She said it's essential for schools to offer classes such as art or music and physical education because for some kids one of those subjects is the only thing that motivates them to come back to school day after day.

Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"What does sunlight do for a plant?\\" and the following answer choices: - during the day - Kills it - it can be seen - Helps it survive - Helps it drink water - It gets heated up - adding heat - Makes the color darker Now knowing that aplant requires food for survival and all plants require sunlight to make their food, choose the best answer. The answer is:","completion":"Helps it survive To provide a detailed explanation, sunlight is essential for the process of photosynthesis in plants. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert sunlight into chemical energy to fuel their growth and development. During photosynthesis, plants absorb light energy using a pigment called chlorophyll, which is found in their leaves. This light energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and water (H2O) from the soil into glucose (a simple sugar) and oxygen (O2). The glucose is either used immediately for the plant's energy needs or stored in the form of starch for later use. Oxygen, a byproduct of photosynthesis, gets released into the atmosphere, which is essential for sustaining life on Earth. Without photosynthesis, plants would be unable to produce food to sustain themselves and provide oxygen for other organisms, including humans. None of the other answer choices capture the importance of sunlight in a plant's life as accurately as \\"Helps it survive\\". Some of the choices, such as \\"Kills it\\" and \\"Makes the color darker,\\" are not accurate descriptions of the positive effects sunlight has on plants. Other options, like \\"it can be seen\\" or \\"It gets heated up,\\" only describe incidental effects of sunlight and do not capture its essential role in the plant's survival and growth. In summary, sunlight plays a crucial role in a plant's life by facilitating the process of photosynthesis, which helps plants to produce food and release oxygen into the atmosphere. Therefore, out of all the answer choices provided, \\"Helps it survive\\" is the best answer that accurately describes the importance of sunlight for a plant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

US First Lady: On Thursday, Mrs Obama appealed for parents to do more to help fight childhood obesity. The SNA, which represents 55,000 school food service professionals, released its 2015 Position Paper last week as lawmakers continue to prepare to reauthorize the widely-criticized scheme. In the recent batch of photos, one female student tweeted a photo of a slice of moldy salami and another piece of meat in a wrap, with the caption: 'Had a yummy lunch today guys! Salami and mold.' Meanwhile, another student, Cole Sahr, posted an image of what appear to be two thin wraps filled with meat, with a small side portion of carrots. In his caption, he deemed the meal 'pathetic'.

In his accompanying caption, he deemed the meal 'pathetic' Another let down: The SNA, which represents 55,000 school food service professionals, released its 2015 Position Paper last week as lawmakers continue to prepare to reauthorize the widely-criticized scheme. 'USDA data shows that since the new rules were implemented, 1.4 million fewer children choose school lunch each day,' according to the release, obtained by EAG.org. 'Declining student participation reduces meal program revenue for schools already stressed by higher food and labor costs under the new regulations.' In the release, the SNA suggests several fixes to the scheme. These include increasing the per-meal reimbursement for school lunches by 35 per cent, according to the site. They also include maintaining Target 1 sodium level reduction and suspending the implementation of further targets, and ensuring at least half of grains offered are whole grain rich, The Hill reported. Other suggestions include permitting school food managers to decide if students should take a fruit or vegetable as part of a reimbursable meal, and easing restrictions on a la carte food items. 'Cold bread roll': Mariah Dilbeck also uploaded a picture of her school lunch (pictured), comprising apricot slices, a piece of toast, a carton of juice, a smidgen of butter and a bread roll that was apparently 'cold'. Mrs Obama made herself a national emblem of healthier eating in 2010 with a legislative push for more fruit, vegetables and whole grains in school meals, along with less sodium, sugar and fat. School nutritionists and food service workers, and their unions, hailed the law's passage but have since turned on Mrs Obama, saying her caloric inflexibility has sparked a downturn in lunch sales. Many school districts, they say, are now losing money on food instead of turning a profit that pays for books, computers and football-field scoreboards. In a news release, SNA CEO Patricia Montague said: 'Some of USDA’s regulations under the law have unnecessarily increased costs and waste for school meal programs and caused many students to swap healthy school meals for junk food fare' Last year, Mrs Obama vowed to fight for the current school meal restrictions 'until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have.'. According to Fox News, she said: 'The last thing that we can afford to do right now is play politics with our kids' health, especially when we're finally starting to see some progress on this issue.' And on Thursday, she appealed for parents to do more to help during a visit to New York. She told members of the public to 'dive into' the fight against childhood obesity - and listed a number of specific ways in which parents can help in that battle, NEWSOK reported. In March, around 1,000 school nutrition professionals from across America will descend on Capitol Hill as part of the 43rd annual Legislative Action Conference's 'Charge the Hill' campaign.

But when we asked our readers whether they would clone (, )their beloved animals, the responses were split almost down the middle. Of the 228 readers who answered it, 108 would clone, 111 would not and nine weighed each side without offering an opinion. Clearly, from readers' response, this is an issue that reaches deeply into both the joy and _ . It speaks, as well, to people's widely differing expectations over the developing scientific procedure. Most of the respondents who favored the idea strongly believed it would produce at least a close copy of the original; many felt the process would actually return an exact copy. Those on the other side, however, held little hope a clone could never truly recreate a pet, many simply didn't wish to go against the natural law of life and death. Both sides expressed equal love for their animals. More than a few respondents owned \\"the best dog/cat in the world\\". They thought of their pets as their \\"best friend\\", \\"a member of the family,\\"\\"the light of my life.\\" They told moving stories of pets' heroism, intelligence and selfless devotion. Then the loss is so disturbing---and the cloning so attractive. \\"People become very close to their animals, and the loss can be just as hard to bear as when a friend or family member dies,\\" says Gary Kowalski, author of Goodbye, Friend: Healing Wisdom for Anyone Who Has Ever Lost a Pet. \\"For me, cloning feels like an attempt to turn death away...It's understandable.

Premise: The rule also appears subject to section 205 of the Act, relating to consideration of regulatory alternatives. Hypothesis: The consideration of regulatory alternatives, which is a part of section 205 of the Act, also has an impact on the rule. Step 2: Understand the key terms and their relationships. Key terms: - Rule: the regulation in question - Section 205 of the Act: a section in the legislation that deals with the consideration of regulatory alternatives - Regulatory alternatives: different options or choices that can be used to achieve a regulatory goal Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. According to the premise, the rule is subject to section 205 of the Act, which relates to the consideration of regulatory alternatives. This means that the rule has to be in compliance with section 205, and the section has some influence on the rule. The hypothesis states that the consideration of regulatory alternatives, part of section 205 of the Act, has an impact on the rule. This suggests that the rule is influenced by the process of considering and evaluating various regulatory alternatives as outlined in section 205. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Since the premise states that the rule is subject to section 205 and the hypothesis states that section 205 has an impact on the rule, we can conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise establishes a relationship between the rule and section 205, and the hypothesis specifically states the nature of this relationship (the consideration of regulatory alternatives has an impact on the rule). Therefore, based on the given premise, it is reasonable to conclude that the consideration of regulatory alternatives, which is a part of section 205 of the Act, also has an impact on the rule."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are possible answers to this question: - ripe - greenweed - yellow - processed - cloy I believe the correct choice is \\"processed\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"processed,\\" and the reason behind this selection has to do with the primary goal of the individual attempting to eat more green, along with the differences between the types of food options presented. Eating more \\"green\\" typically refers to consuming a diet that is rich in plant-based, fresh, whole, and unprocessed foods. These natural and simple ingredients promote overall health and well-being and are often nutrient-dense, providing essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. This dietary approach also focuses on sustainability and environmental conservation, as it reduces our carbon footprint and supports local farming practices. Now let's analyze the other options to provide a clearer understanding of why \\"processed\\" is the most appropriate choice: 1. Ripe: This term usually refers to the optimal maturity of fruits and vegetables, which indicates that they are ready for consumption. Although eating ripe produce is definitely encouraged, the term does not specifically highlight the concept of focusing on unprocessed, green foods. 2. Greenweed: This term is somewhat ambiguous, but it could potentially refer to a specific plant, such as Genista tinctoria (also known as Dyer's greenweed). While it is true that consuming a variety of plant-based foods is essential for a 'green' diet, this answer does not fully encapsulate the broader idea of preferring simple and unprocessed ingredients. 3. Yellow: This option likely refers to the color of particular fruits and vegetables. Although a colorful and diverse diet is crucial for maintaining good health, the color yellow does not directly correlate to the goal of consuming simple and unprocessed ingredients. 4. Cloy: This term is generally used to describe a sickly-sweet flavor or an overindulgence in rich foods. It does not pertain to the concept of eating green, simple ingredients, nor does it offer any further context to the individual's nutritional goals. In conclusion, the best choice to represent the individual's attempt to eat more green, simple ingredients is \\"processed,\\" as it emphasizes the importance of avoiding heavily processed and nutrient-depleted foods in favor of whole, unprocessed, and sustainable options. This approach is not only beneficial for personal health but also actively contributes to a healthier planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Robert was more of a loner than Brett because Robert hated to talk to people. Throughout his life, he had always found solace in his own company; it was easier, and he didn't have to worry about the pressures of social interactions. He would spend hours lost in his thoughts, exploring the depths of his imagination and pondering life's mysteries. Step 1: Establish the contrast between Robert and Brett's personalities. Brett, on the other hand, was quite outgoing and loved meeting new people. He could strike up a conversation with almost anyone and make friends within minutes. It was a talent that Robert secretly admired, but it was something that he knew he could never do. Step 2: Describe how their contrasting personalities affect their friendship. Despite their contrasting personalities, the two of them had been friends for years. Being an extrovert, Brett would often try to get Robert to join him at parties or social gatherings, but most of the time, Robert would decline, preferring to stay home and read a book or watch a movie. However, they enjoyed each other's company when it was just the two of them hanging out, having deep, meaningful conversations that lasted for hours. Step 3: Introduce a challenge or conflict for the characters to overcome together. One day, Brett received an invitation to attend a prestigious art gallery opening. Knowing how much Robert loved art, Brett thought this would be the perfect opportunity for his introverted friend to get out and mingle among like-minded individuals. Step 4: Describe Robert's initial hesitation and Brett's encouragement. At first, Robert was hesitant to attend the event, fearing the social awkwardness that would inevitably ensue. But with Brett's encouragement and reassurance that he would be by his side the entire time, Robert reluctantly agreed to go. Step 5: Outline the turning point or resolution of the story. The art gallery opening turned out to be a transformative experience for Robert. Surrounded by stunning artwork and passionate discussions, he found himself opening up to strangers and engaging in conversations about his favorite artists and their work. With Brett's support, Robert slowly started to conquer his fear of social interactions. He realized that connecting with others could be just as meaningful and enriching as exploring his own thoughts. Step 6: Conclude the story by showing the character growth and the strengthened bond between Robert and Brett. From that night on, Robert became more willing to step outside of his comfort zone. While he would never be as outgoing as Brett, he had learned the value of connecting with others. As for Brett, he remained a loyal and supportive friend, always pushing Robert to challenge himself in their lasting and fulfilling friendship."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve -85*f + 1546 + 944 = -2*f for f.","completion":"To solve for 'f' in the equation -85f + 1546 + 944 = -2f, you will need to take the following steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. You can start by combining like terms on the left side of the equation, which are the constant terms 1546 and 944. Doing this gives you: -85f + 2490 = -2f Step 2: Isolate the variable terms. Next, you want to get all the terms involving 'f' on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. You can do this by adding 85f to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -85f on the left side. This results in: -85f + 85f + 2490 = -2f + 85f 2490 = 83f Step 3: Solve for 'f'. Finally, you can solve for 'f' by dividing both sides of the equation by 83: 2490 / 83 = 30 = f So, the solution to the equation -85f + 1546 + 944 = -2f is f = 30. Remember our primary goal was to isolate 'f', which we were able to do by first combining like terms and then using the properties of equality to get 'f' by itself.

Question 1: How much weight can one gain per month? Question 2: Is it possible to gain 6-7 kg weight in one month with just the gym and extra food? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer these questions, let's address them step by step. Question 1: How much weight can one gain per month? Step 1: Understand the factors affecting weight gain - Caloric intake (how much food one is consuming) - Exercise habits (how much one is burning off) - Genetics and metabolism - General health status Step 2: Calculate a general estimate of weight gain - On average, a person can gain about 0.5-1 kg (1-2 pounds) per week in a healthy manner. - There are around 4 weeks in a month, so theoretically one can gain about 2-4 kg (4-8 pounds) per month. Question 2: Is it possible to gain 6-7 kg weight in one month with just the gym and extra food? Step 1: Determine if the target weight gain is within safe limits - 6-7 kg in one month is more than the average healthy weight gain of 2-4 kg per month. Step 2: Consider the challenges of such rapid weight gain - Putting on that much weight in one month may be challenging in terms of consuming enough calories without compromising the quality of the diet. - Additionally, it may not be sustainable or healthy for the body. Step 3: Assess the role of exercise - Intense strength training and resistance exercises can promote muscle growth, which contributes to weight gain. - However, it takes time for muscles to grow, and gaining 6-7 kg of muscle mass in one month might not be attainable at a healthy pace. In conclusion, the answer to these two questions is not the same. While it is possible to gain weight, gaining 6-7 kg in one month may not be considered healthy or feasible. Instead, a more gradual approach that focuses on a healthy diet, exercise, and sustainable habits would be a better approach to weight gain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The U.S. government is being asked to update its 16-year-old cell phone radiation standard to bring it in line with current research and the way people use smartphones. A new Government Accountability Office report on Wednesday asked the Federal Communications Commission to consider updating the standard, which limits the amount of radiation a phone emits. The report recommended following an international standard, which would allow U.S. cell phones to emit up to 20% more radiation than currently allowed. The GAO also asked the FCC to consider updating its cell phone testing procedures to account for phones being used while next to the body -- such as in a pocket or held in your hand -- rather than only testing how phones emit radiation when held up to your ear. \\"By testing mobile phones only when at a distance from the body,","completion":"the FCC may not be identifying the maximum exposure, since many people carry their phones in their pockets or hold them in their hands,\\" the story says. So, to end this story, the U.S. government is thinking about changing some rules about cell phone radiation to make sure they are safe and up-to-date with how people use their phones today. This may include letting phones have a little more radiation (but still safe), and testing phones when they are in different places, like in a pocket or being held in a hand, instead of just when they are being used next to the ear. This will help make sure that everyone stays healthy and safe while using their cell phones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write a title for this article: TRENTON IN AN effort to get a handle on the growing problem of trying to find some way to balance his first state budget, Governor Kean is preparing to create an Office of Management and Budget similar to the one run for President Reagan by David T. Stockman. Since it embodies his philosophy and emphasizes those programs he deems worthwhile, the budget is the Governor's political document. However, Mr. Kean is having a difficult time finding enough money to keep the basic machinery of the state's government running efficiently, much less institute any new programs designed to effect the types of changes he believes in. Current estimates of the shortfall that the Governor faces range up to 400 million. This is a considerable sum, especially in light of his pledge not to raise taxes and of the sudden cutbacks in Federal largesse. Mr. Kean originally was scheduled to deliver his budget message to the state's lawmakers on Feb. 15. However, this was moved back to March 15 by the Democratic-controlled Legislature to give the new Republican administration more time to find those economies in government that everybody talks about during campaigns. Last week, the Democrats offered to delay the budget message deadline by another month. But this seemingly generous offer by State Senator Laurence S. Weiss, Democrat of Perth Amboy, and Assemblyman Robert C. Janiszewski, Democrat of Jersey City, chairman and vice chairman of the Joint Appropriations Committee, was designed to increase, not diminish, the political pressure on Mr. Kean. The two lawmakers said they wanted the new Governor to have all the time he needed to get the job done, and added: ''This is Tom Kean's budget, not Brendan Byrne's.'' In other words, the Democrats wanted to foreclose the time-honored apologia allowed all new Governors -that their first budget is really a hand-me-down from the prior administration and one over which they have little control. And the Democrats further disclosed their real motives by including a partial transcript of the remarks Mr. Kean made during a campaign debate with the Democratic candidate for Governor, Representative James J. Florio of Runnemede. In the transcript, Mr. Kean was asked how he would cope with a large deficit, given his promise to cut business taxes and, if possible, the state sales tax. ''I really don't think that in a 6 billion budget I'm going to have that much trouble finding the money,'' Mr. Kean said. At the time, he was talking of a 100 million shortfall. Actually, the last Byrne budget, which ends June 30, is expected to have a 100 million surplus. The budget-balancing problems have been created, at least in part, by Governor Kean's promises and President Reagan's projected Federalaid cutbacks and shifts of responsibility. Mr. Kean has said that he would not drop minimum school aid for affluent districts, something Mr. Byrne did to balance his last budget. This 65 million item was restored by the Legislature for political reasons in an election year and, although the sum is not large, it becomes part of a larger problem. The Byrne administration also used 83 million in gambling-casino revenue funds to finance exisitng programs for the elderly, thereby relieving that amount of pressure on the general state budget. Again, Mr. Kean said that he would not do that again, and that adds 83 million to the problem. President Reagan, in addition to proposing a 700 million reduction in Federal aid to New Jersey next year, also wants to take back some 40 million in funds promised for the current year. Add that to the list of growing problems - along with state employees' salary increases and the usual litany of items affected by inflation (which means almost everything but state tax revenue) - and the size of the task begins to become apparent. It is impossible to get anyone in the Kean administration to talk about hard figures. There is a lid on any mention of money and programs, and since preoccupation with the budget is consuming everyone's attention, there is very little visible activity around the State House these days. Mr. Kean's choice to play the David Stockman role in his special budget office is Alfred F. Fasola Jr., who helped run his successful recount of the votes cast in the Nov. 3 general election and was a member of his transition team. It will be Mr. Fasola's task to examine the budget - department by department and line by line - to look for the fat everyone says is there, and to pump some long-range economies into the system, which is going to be on short rations for a long time to come.","completion":"Title: \\"Governor Kean's Struggle to Balance New Jersey's Budget Amid Funding Shortfalls and Political Pressure\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Choices: - sulfide - carbonate - fermite - halide A: A:","completion":"When saltwater evaporates, the type of minerals that primarily form are known as halide minerals. Halide minerals belong to a broader group of minerals that consist of chemical elements to which a halogen atom, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, has been bonded. The most commonly formed halide mineral related to the evaporation of saltwater is halite, which is also known as rock salt or common table salt. The chemical formula for halite is NaCl, composed of one sodium atom (Na) and one chlorine atom (Cl). Saltwater consists of various dissolved salts, with sodium chloride being the most prevalent. These salts present in natural sources of water like seawater or salt lakes have accumulated over time due to the constant cycle of evaporation and precipitation. As water evaporates, the concentrations of these dissolved salts increase because they do not evaporate along with the water molecules. When the concentration of these dissolved salts reaches a certain saturation point, the minerals start to precipitate and form solid crystalline structures. Other halide minerals that can form due to the evaporation of saltwater include sylvite (KCl), bischofite (MgCl2•6H2O), and carnallite (KMgCl3•6H2O). However, these are less common compared to halite. To summarize, when saltwater evaporates, the primary minerals formed are halide minerals, with halite being the most common among them. Halide minerals consist of chemical elements that bond with halogen atoms, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine.

Options: (A) F: Wait me for a second. I'll grab my books and take the night class with you. (B) F: You can review quickly as the final exam is easier than the easy midterm. (C) F: I am afraid I did not quite catch what you were saying. Please repeat it. (D) F: Wow, really? I hope you will find a satisfying job on the Internet this evening. In the conversation, both people are discussing the difficulty of an upcoming exam. From the options given: Option A - This seems to be the most reasonable as it suggests that F will join M in studying, which fits the context of the conversation. Option B - This doesn't fit the conversation, as it states the final exam is easier, while M mentioned it will be harder than the mid-term exam. Option C - This also doesn't fit the conversation, as F appeared to understand what M said and didn't ask for repetition. Option D - This option is unrelated to the conversation topic, which is about studying for an exam, not finding a job online.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: They simply are! Here is a hypothesis: They are. Here are the options: pick from the following. [-] yes [-] it is not possible to tell [-] no Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"If the premise is \\"They simply are!\\", it implies a definitive assertion about the existence or state of something. Likewise, the hypothesis \\"They are.\\" is also a positive assertion about the same existence or state. Given the three options - yes, it is not possible to tell, and no, let's explore whether it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Option 1: Yes There are some correlations between the premise and the hypothesis as both make positive assertions about the existence or state of something. If we assume the subject matter is the same in both the premise and the hypothesis, then we can say that if the premise is true (They simply are!), it makes sense to assume that the hypothesis (They are.) is also true. Thus, one could argue that if the premise is indeed true, so might be the hypothesis. Option 2: It is not possible to tell While there is a correlation between the premise and the hypothesis' positive assertion, there is still some level of ambiguity due to the lack of context and specifics regarding the subject matter. Without knowing the context, we might not be able to accurately determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Therefore, it may be argued that it is not possible to tell with absolute certainty if the hypothesis is true when the premise is true. Option 3: No One can also argue against the conclusion that if the premise is true then so is the hypothesis. This argument would be based on the lack of context and specifics in both the premise and the hypothesis. As we have not been provided with the subject matter or any information regarding it, we cannot infer a direct relationship between the premise and the hypothesis that ensures the truth of one guarantees the truth of the other. Considering the three options, it can be argued that the most reasonable answer would be \\"It is not possible to tell\\" whether the hypothesis is true when the premise is true. This is mainly due to the lack of context and specific information regarding the subject matter. While there is a correlation in terms of the assertions, without a clear understanding of the context, we cannot reach a confident conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: She supported the dazed girl. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Both sentences convey that support is being provided to the girl, who is described as dazed or disoriented. In the first sentence, the context is clearly stated - \\"She seemed to be supporting the girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself.\\" The sentence suggests that the girl is receiving assistance, and her condition is depicted as extremely disoriented, as she is described as looking \\"utterly dazed and unlike herself\\". This level of detail provides a vivid image of the situation and helps the reader to better understand the girl's emotional or mental state. The second sentence - \\"She supported the dazed girl.\\" - essentially conveys the same key message. The main difference between the two sentences is the level of detail. The first sentence provides more context and description, making the situation seem more specific and real. In comparison, the second sentence is more concise, but it still maintains the core meaning, that the girl is supported by someone else while being in a dazed state. In conclusion, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence is true as well. Both sentences depict a scenario in which \\"she\\" is providing support to a girl who is disoriented and struggling. The main difference lies in the richness of the description, with the first sentence being more detailed and evocative, while the second sentence communicates the main point in a more simplified and straightforward manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It can influence our choice of purchase when we go shopping and can also affect the way we look and feel. A person can be naturally attracted to one particular color1 while finding another color1 repulsive. The influence of color1 on human emotions and feelings is very powerful and designers, advertisers, artists and even doctors use _ in their professions for different purposes. Every day, without even thinking about it, we use color1 to communicate our feelings. For example, the color1 we choose to wear is one way of expressing ourselves. It says something about the person, how he or she feels, and how he or she wants others to feel about the wearer. In other words, color1 talks. A person who wants to appear stylish and mature will usually wear dark color1s or black. A person who wishes to appear youngish, pure and innocent dresses in white, like the choice of a bride's wedding gown. Also clothed in white are doctors, dentists, nurses and hospital in-patients as the color1 expresses comfort, cleanliness and professionalism. Brown, blue or grey clothes are the usual color1s worn by office workers so as not to draw unnecessary attention to them. They are, in a way, conveying the message that they want to be noticed for their work, not their appearance. People who wear bright, strong color1s like to be attractive and these color1s are particularly popular with actresses, singers and party goers. In the past, common people were not allowed to wear certain color1s. In Thailand, for example, only kings, queens and members of the royal family could wear purple while in ancient China, yellow was the color1 reserved for the emperor and the empress. Nowadays, people can wear whatever color1 they like or as they think appropriate. Question: Brides wear white because it is a color1 for _ .

Choices: - cylindrical - tissue - atrophied - striated A: A:","completion":"Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated. In the given paragraph, the question asks what similarity cardiac muscle shares with skeletal muscle. To provide a detailed answer, let's first understand the characteristics of each option mentioned. 1. Cylindrical: Both skeletal and cardiac muscles have a cylindrical shape. However, this option would not be the best choice because it does not address the specific type or function of the muscle tissue. 2. Tissue: Although both skeletal and cardiac muscles are specialized types of body tissues, this answer choice is too vague, as it would encompass many other types of muscle tissue and not address the specific similarities between skeletal and cardiac muscles. 3. Atrophied: \\"Atrophy\\" refers to the decrease in size and strength of a muscle, usually due to disuse or lack of exercise. It could occur in multiple types of muscles, but it is not a shared defining characteristic of skeletal and cardiac muscles. 4. Striated: The correct answer is striated. Striated muscles have a unique structure formed by alternating light and dark bands, visible under a microscope. Both skeletal and cardiac muscles are striated, which accounts for their similar appearance and their ability to contract in a coordinated manner. In summary, like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated because both types of muscles possess a similar structural appearance and contractile function. This specific characteristic distinguishes them from other types of muscle tissue, such as smooth muscle, found in the walls of blood vessels and internal organs, which does not have a striated appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The people of Bali were happy and had a peaceful life. They were not allowed to fight. At one time there had been terrible wars on Bali. Then the people decided it was wrong to fight or have wars. They made rules to keep apart those people who wanted to fight. Bali was divided into seven small kingdoms. The land around each kingdom was kept empty, and no one lived there. Since the kingdoms did not share the same borders , the people could not fight about them. On Bali, even children were not allowed to fight. If two children started a fight over a toy, someone separated them. When two boys argued, they would agree not to speak to each other. Sometimes they did not talk together for months; this gave the boys a chance to forget their anger. Families who were angry with each other also promised not to speak.

In the FA Cup, Southampton had an excellent run reaching the semi-final against Arsenal. The semi-final was played at Stamford Bridge on 26 March 1927; after the Saints had an early penalty appeal turned down by the referee, Arsenal mounted a prolonged pressure on the Southampton goal, resulting in the opening score, when a cross-shot from Joe Hulme was deflected by Hough past Tommy Allen into the Saints' goal. Arsenal went on to win the match 2–1 to reach the final, where they lost 1–0 to Cardiff City.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What was offered to the city of Reykjavík as a gift?, using the article: The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job.

Context:After we finished work on the deck we drove around different places selling watermelons out of the back of Norm 's truck . We got about 150 for 100 and sold them 1 for 3 or 2 for 5 . We figured it 'd be an evening of easy money . Only we only sold about 20 so we did n't even make back our investment . Question Where did the watermelons come from ? Answer:","completion":"The origins of the watermelons in this situation are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the context, we can infer some possibilities about where the watermelons might have come from. One potential source of the watermelons could be a local farm or a wholesale market. Since Norm and the narrator managed to purchase around 150 watermelons for 100, it suggests they might have gotten a bulk or wholesale price for them. Farmers often sell their produce in bulk to people looking to resell them in smaller quantities, like in this case, or to grocery stores, restaurants, and other businesses. It's also possible that they went to a wholesale market, where various sellers would convene with their produce, and they could purchase the watermelons in one mass lot. Another possibility is that the watermelons were sourced from a farmer's market or roadside stand, which often sell fresh produce directly to customers. Although this option might not always offer as competitive a price as a wholesale market or a direct-buy from a farm, it could still present opportunities for reselling the produce at a profit. Finally, the watermelons may have been grown by a friend or acquaintance of Norm or the narrator who was looking to offload their excess harvest. This kind of arrangement would be relatively informal and could provide them with a favorable price, as well as a supply of fresh, locally-grown watermelons to sell. In summary, the exact source of the watermelons is not specified in the context provided. However, it's likely that the watermelons were sourced through a bulk purchase either from a local farm, a wholesale market, a farmer's market, a roadside stand, or through a personal connection. Regardless of their origin, the goal was to resell the watermelons in smaller quantities and make a profit, which unfortunately did not transpire as they didn't manage to sell enough to recover their initial investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The reading for both August and July is the best seen since the survey began in August 1997. It is the highest reading since the index was created in August 1997.","completion":"To determine the similarity between the two sentences, we have to look at their semantic and syntactic aspects: 1) Syntactic comparison: This looks at the structure of sentences. The two sentences are quite different in structure, with the first one having more detailed context (mentioning August and July specifically). 2) Semantic comparison: This considers the meaning of the sentences. Both sentences essentially provide the same information - that a reading/index is at its highest since August 1997. Steps: 1) Identify key points in both sentences: both sentences refer to a reading/index being at its best/highest since August 1997. 2) Compare the details in the sentences: The first sentence is more specific, mentioning 'both August and July’ while the second sentence is more general. 3) Analyze the differences and similarities based on these key points and details. Justification: Based on the syntactic comparison, the sentences are quite different (rating 2 out of 5). However, the semantic comparison shows that the sentences are very similar, expressing the same core idea (rating 5 out of 5). Given equal weight to both metrics, I would average the scores.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Imagine you are standing in a farm field in central Illinois. The land is so flat you can see for miles and miles. On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Why do you think this is? What could have caused these features? There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Where did glaciers go? Where can you see them today? Glaciers are masses of flowing ice. Question: \\"What features did the glaciers cause in Illinois?\\" Answer: \\"Flat land\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, that's partially correct. The glaciers, especially the last ice age, helped to flatten the land in central Illinois. But it's also important to mention that the glaciers are responsible for the rolling hills in southern Illinois. As the glaciers moved and eventually melted, they left behind different land features such as flat areas and rolling hills. So, the glaciers caused both flat land in central Illinois and rolling hills in southern Illinois."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:The pair obtained huge amounts of information about the browsing habits of three million German citizens from companies that gather \\"clickstreams\\". These are detailed records of everywhere that people go online. The researchers argue such data - which some firms scoop up and use to target ads - should be protected. The data is supposed to be anonymised, but analysis showed it could easily be tied to individuals. People's browsing history is often used to tailor marketing campaigns. The results of the research by Svea Eckert and Andreas Dewes were revealed at the Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas this weekend. The pair found that 95% of the data they obtained came from 10 popular browser extensions. \\"What these companies are doing is illegal in Europe but they do not care,\\" said Ms Eckert, adding that the research had kicked off a debate in Germany about how to curb the data gathering habits of the firms. Before the data is used to customise the range of adverts which people see, any information that could be used to identify exactly who generated the clicks is supposed to be removed. However, said Mr Dewes, it was \\"trivial\\" - meaning easy - to tie the information directly to people and reveal exactly where they went online, the terms they searched for and the things they bought. Cyber-hacks season: The data analysed by the pair connected a list of sites and links visited to a customer identifier. However, he said, by drawing on public information that people share about their browsing habits, it became possible to connect that entry on a list to an individual. \\"With only a few domains you can quickly drill down into the data to just a few users,\\" he said. The public information included links people shared via Twitter, YouTube videos they reported watching, news articles they passed on via social media or when they posted online photos of items they bought or places they visited. In many cases, he said, it was even easier to de-anonymise because the clickstreams contained links to people's personal social media admin pages which directly revealed their identity. \\"The public information available about users is growing so it's getting easier to find the information to do the de-anonymisation,\\" he said. \\"It's very, very difficult to de-anonymise it even if you have the intention to do so.\\" The information revealed an intimate portrait of the browsing habits of people, said Ms Eckert. \\"This could be so creepy to abuse,\\" she said \\"You could have an address book and just look up people by their names and see everything they did.\\" In many cases the browsing habits did not expose anything illegal but might prove difficult for public figures to explain or justify, she said. In some cases it could leave them open to blackmail. \\"After the research project we deleted the data because we did not want to have it close to our hands any more,\\" she said. \\"We were scared that we would be hacked.\\" When asked about UK plans to make ISPs gather clickstreams on every Briton for security purposes, Ms Eckert urged the government to restrict for how long the information could be kept. \\"If you are strong on data protection then you should not be allowed to do it,\\" she said, \\"But for security purposes then perhaps you can hold on to it for a while.\\" Limiting how long it could be held would lessen the damage if the clickstreams were leaked or hacked, she said. \\"You have to be very careful,\\" she said \\"It's so, so dangerous.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Two researchers found out a lot about what three million people in Germany like to do on the internet.

This information is supposed to be secret, but the researchers found out it was easy to find out who it belonged to.

Homer refers to the \\"Hellenes\\" (/ˈhɛliːnz/) as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia, with its warriors under the command of Achilleus. The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Γραικοί). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an area in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, the location of the great deluge of Deucalion, a land occupied by the Selloi and the \\"Greeks\\" who later came to be known as \\"Hellenes\\". Selloi were the priests of Dodonian Zeus and the word probably means \\"sacrificers\\" (compare Gothic saljan, \\"present, sacrifice\\"). There is currently no satisfactory etymology of the name Hellenes. Some scholars assert that the name Selloi changed to Sellanes and then to Hellanes-Hellenes. However this etymology connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain. The name Hellenes seems to be older and it was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League. This was an ancient association of Greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of Apollo in Delphi (Phocis) and of Demeter near Thermopylae (Locris). According to the legend it was founded after the Trojan War by the eponymous Amphictyon, brother of Hellen. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): From what mystical lineage does this name benefactor ascend from ?","completion":"The name Hellenes, as mentioned earlier, comes from Hellen, who was a prominent figure in Greek mythology. The benefactor of this name ascends from a mystical lineage associated with the legendary figures Pyrrha and Deucalion. Hellen was the son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, making him the progenitor of the Hellenes, or the Greek people. To understand this mystical lineage, it is vital to delve into the story of Pyrrha and Deucalion. According to Greek mythology, Deucalion was the son of Prometheus, the Titan known for creating humans from clay and stealing fire from the gods to benefit humanity. Pyrrha, on the other hand, was the daughter of Pandora (the first human woman created by the gods) and Epimetheus (Prometheus' brother). Together, Deucalion and Pyrrha formed an important link in the genealogy between the Titans and human beings. In the myth, Zeus decided to punish humanity for its wickedness by sending a great flood, known as the Deluge. With the advice of his father, Prometheus, Deucalion built an ark to ensure their survival. When the waters receded, Deucalion and Pyrrha found themselves to be the only survivors. They went on to repopulate the Earth by following the instruction of the oracle of Themis to throw the \\"bones of their mother\\" (interpreted as stones) over their shoulders. These stones transformed into new humans, symbolizing the rebirth of humankind. The mystical lineage of the name Hellenes can be traced back to this legendary flood narrative and the figures of Deucalion and Pyrrha. As their son, Hellen was regarded as the patriarch of the Greeks, giving rise to the new name for their people, connecting their origins to a divine and mythical past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - junk drawer - desk - jar - purse - water fountain The rationale to choose \\"desk\\" as the answer is that:","completion":"Choosing \\"desk\\" as the answer for where to put coins after getting home is based on the following rationale: 1. Accessibility and Organization: Keeping your coins on a desk allows for easy access whenever you need them. You can simply reach out and grab the exact change you require. Moreover, a desk usually has compartments, drawers, or sections where you could designate a specific spot for coins. This can help you keep your house organized and prevent them from getting mixed up with other items. 2. Safety and Security: Coins, especially in larger quantities, may have significant value. Placing them in a desk implies storing them in a secure and stable location, shielding them from accidental damage or loss. Many desks come with lockable compartments, which can protect your coins from exposure or potential theft. 3. Aesthetic Appeal: When coins are stored on a desk, they can be neatly arranged, sorted, or even displayed, adding an artistic touch to your space. While placing coins on a desk might not display them as openly as a jar, doing so can still lend a charming or unique vibe to the area where you work or study. 4. Familiarity and Routine: As many individuals spend a considerable amount of time at their desks, returning home and placing coins there could become a routine activity. This makes it easier to remember where your coins are stored, reducing the likelihood of misplacing them or forgetting their location. 5. Convenience for Future Use: Storing coins on a desk means they will be readily available when needed for future purchases or transactions. For example, if you have to pay for items that need exact change or want to distribute coins to your children for their allowances, having your coins right on your desk can save time and effort. Although the other choices provided have their own merits, choosing the \\"desk\\" option for storing coins after returning home takes into account organization, security, aesthetics, familiarity, and convenience. A desk provides an accessible, safe, and visually pleasing location, while also promoting a practical routine for your day-to-day life. So, placing coins on a desk is a highly feasible and logical option to consider."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home.

This behaviour is characteristic of Red Giants, stars in a phase of stellar evolution where they have exhausted the hydrogen at their core and have begun to burn helium and other elements. - Moreover, the steps following the first involve the mass decreasing, fusion ceasing, and outer layers breaking away, further indicating that the process starts from the Red Giant stage. So, we can fairly conclude that the first step should be related to the star expanding and becoming a Red Giant. This is a natural process where a star exhausts its primary nuclear fuel, hydrogen, and starts burning helium and other elements, resulting in an increase in size and brightness. This step is a prerequisite for the subsequent changes in the star's mass, core temperature, and eventual shedding of outer layers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He proposes; she accepts (\\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\\"), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates. Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating \\"Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?\\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty. She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. If there is a chance that you might run into a snake, take care to be very observant. If you are going on a hike or camping, you should be conscious of your surroundings. Be aware of where snakes are most likely to appear. When you are hiking, stay on the trail as much as possible. You might still encounter a snake, but it is less likely than if you wander off of the trail. Avoid tall grass. These areas are very appealing to many types of snakes. Snakes like to hide under rocks and logs. Be careful when walking near these areas. Keep your eyes open and be on the lookout for snakes. You should also use caution when rock climbing. Snakes like to hide in nooks and crannies. Look before placing your hand somewhere on the rock. Ideally, being mindful of your environment will help you to stay away from snakes. However, that is not always possible. If you do encounter a snake, there are several things you can do to remain safe. Try not to panic. Staying calm can help you make the right decisions and help you to stay safe. Don't make any sudden movements in the direction of the snake. Just remain calm, and try not to startle the animal. Remember that the snake was not out looking for you. It likely was just trying to find a place to get warm. One of the most effective ways to survive an encounter with a snake is to not engage. If you come across a snake in your path, walk away. If you can't turn and go the other direction, make sure to give the snake a wide berth as you circle around it. Remember that most snakes have no desire to be around people. That is why you rarely see them. If you see a snake in your yard or garden, just stay away from it. It is likely that the snake will flee when it sees you. Sometimes you might encounter an aggressive snake or one that is cornered. The same advice applies. Do not try to capture the snake. Just head the other direction. Loud sounds can help you to drive a snake from your path. Snakes don't have ears, but they are very sensitive to vibrations. Loud sounds are likely to make a snake flee to a more quiet place. Raise your voice. Try shouting, \\"Go away, snake!\\" or simply just yelling. Stomp your feet loudly. You can also try banging some sticks together. If you have a snake visiting your yard or garden, noise should help you get rid of him. Turn on the lawn mower nearby as a way to make some noise. Summary:","completion":"If you might see a snake, be very careful and watch where you are going. Stay on paths and avoid tall grass, rocks, and logs where snakes like to hide. If you see a snake, don't panic and don't go near it. Just walk away and maybe make loud noises to scare it away.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Having trouble thinking of a good Gamertag? Your actual name is a great place to start. Try making a play on your first or last name. If you have a nickname, you can use it as well. Another idea is to make a pun or a reference to a character with a similar name from fiction. Examples: Someone named John Smith might try XxSmithxX, JSmith95, JohnnyBoy1234, or AgentSmith4589. Don't include your full, real name in your Gamertag. Keep in mind that anyone you play on Xbox Live will be able to see your name. For security reasons, it's a wise idea to keep your real-world identity to yourself. If there's a specific game you love, consider referring to it in your name. It doesn't matter whether you play this game any more than the others. You might try naming yourself after a character from this game. You can also try something less on-the-nose like a place, weapon, or event. Examples: If you love the Halo series, you might try MasterChief3000, MrNeedler, CortanaLover99, CovenenantSquad01, or EliteHammer. Video games aren't the only things in the world that interest you, so they don't have to be the only things in your name. Draw on your wide range of skills, hobbies, and interests to think of an idea. You might reference an animal you like, a band you're a fan of, your dream car, or something else entirely. It's all up to you! Examples: If you're a musician, you might try names with music terminology like TrebleKill333, BassicInstinct, Bad2theTrombone, BFlattened, and so on. Intent on completely wrecking your competition online? Let other players know that you mean business with a name that calls attention to your lethal skill with a controller. Go for a name that sounds scary, deadly, or diabolical. Keep in mind, though, that hate speech and offensive content are banned under the XBox Live terms of service. Examples: 7Obliter8r9, MsJennyDeath, Noobs Beware, KillerJoe, etc. Another way to give your competition the jitters is not to outright say that you plan to destroy them. Instead, suggest it. Names that imply some sort of mysterious or suspicious quality are quite popular as Gamertags. Sometimes, it's all about what you don't tell your enemy. Examples: OnlyInTheShadows, Ninjitsu765, UnseenDoom, BehindYou! Your Gamertag doesn't have to be grim or serious. In fact, having a more light-hearted one can make you seem more approachable to other players. This can be good when you're working with teammates toward a shared objective. Names that make someone laugh at first sight are always a good bet. Since you're working with a limited number of characters, quick puns are often easiest. Examples: ChrisPBacon, CubaBaddingJR, TheOtherGuy, HeyYou (so that when people talk to you in-game, it's confusing.) You may want to try using an online tool like the Pun Generator (available here) if you're having trouble thinking of ideas. All you need is a few words of a non-English language to give yourself a Gamertag that's unique in English-language games. You have a few options here. One is to translate a cool-sounding name that's already taken into another language. You can also try using the language's equivalent of your real name. You can even just find a word that you like the look of — it's up to you! Examples: If you're a fan of bears, you might try Urso (\\"Urso\\" is \\"bear\\" in Portuguese) or Ayi (\\"Ayi\\" is \\"bear\\" in Turkish) Online translators like Google Translate and Freetranslation.com can help with these sorts of names. There's no rule that your name has to make sense. In fact, the more random your name, the less likely that it's already taken. Try combining two words that have no connection or using a random adjective to describe a word you happen to like. The more creative, the better! Examples: GrandioseFox, OceanPillar, PantHill, Seven8Six, etc. You can even use a nonsense word or phrase — something that means nothing at all.","completion":"This article suggests creating a unique Gamertag by using your name, hobbies, favorite games, puns, mysterious or funny names, foreign languages, and random or nonsense words, but avoid sharing your full real name for security reasons."},{"prompt":"Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was in ever-present danger of relapse on drugs? is inside the article: Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs written for the album such as \\"By the Way,\\" \\"I Could Die for You,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" \\"Warm Tape\\" and non-album tracks \\"Someone\\" and \\"Body of Water\\" all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like \\"This Is the Place\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in \\"This Is the Place\\" and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: \\"On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean.\\" \\"Venice Queen\\" was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach. It mourned her death as a painful loss: \\"We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen.\\" By the Way diverged from the band's previous styles, containing few funk-driven songs. \\"Can't Stop\\" and the title track were the only songs which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses. \\"Throw Away Your Television,\\" while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk-oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus. Other \\"experimental\\" tracks include the melodica-based \\"On Mercury.\\" \\"Cabron,\\" the only track to be played entirely on acoustic guitar, has distinctive Latin influences. \\"Tear\\" and \\"Warm Tape\\" were keyboard based more so than guitar or bass, the latter being completely written on the instrument.

Is this review positive or negative? OPTIONS: -negative -positive Answer:","completion":"The review can be classified as negative. Despite the customer acknowledging that the Starbucks drinks were fine and they usually experience friendly staff service, they've predominantly focused on the unpleasant experience they had this time. The reviewer mentions that the young man who was making the beverages exhibited a grumpy attitude towards them and another staff member - this point shows customer dissatisfaction and a negative encounter. Because the reviewer's focus is on the negative aspects of their experience, we can infer that the review is not meant to praise or promote the services at Starbucks but to highlight an issue and express dissatisfaction. On another note, it's also worthwhile mentioning that in the review there is no mention of the staff's performance affecting the quality of the beverage - it signifies that the customer is distinguishing between the product and the service. The critique is primarily aimed at the behavior of the staff member, not the drinks themselves. This is a classic example of how a single negative interaction can color an overall customer experience negatively and lead to a poor review, despite the quality of the product being up to par. The fact that this unusual negative experience prompted the customer to write a review indicates a significant impact on their perception of Starbucks during that visit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pakistan faces a renewed threat of rising Islamic extremism, vigilantism, attacks on minorities and a reluctance to face up to how these threats are internally rather than externally inspired. Also missing is the lack of a comprehensive narrative against extremism, articulated unanimously by all bodies of the state and civil society. The result of the failure to push forward a clear counter-terrorism and counter-extremism narrative that embraces the entire public domain is that some extremist groups continue to be tolerated by elements of the state. Just over two years ago, on 16 December 2014, an attack on an army-run school in Peshawar which killed 150 people - the majority of them children - galvanised the civilian government, opposition parties and the military to articulate the need for a comprehensive counter-terrorism plan. For the first time there emerged a 20-point National Action Plan - a list of pointers of what needed to be done, endorsed by the military and all political parties. However the 20 points were never turned into a comprehensive winning strategy or a common narrative and the fight against extremism has diminished ever since. The army's Operation Zarb-e-Azb, launched six months earlier, had cleared out North Waziristan, a key staging area for dozens of militant groups - many of them foreigners. Other military operations also took place, dramatically reducing terrorist bombings nationwide. But they were always going to be tactical operations, which still needed to be backed by a strategic plan carried through by the government. It was the task of the civilian government to carry out educational reforms, job creation, co-ordination among intelligence agencies, galvanising the legal system, a ban on hate speech and a clear strategy of de-radicalisation of the nation's youth. All these aspects of a strategy to be carried out by the government, as opposed to tactical military operations, have been missing, as the government has slipped into inertia and paralysis. At the same time the state gave a pass to those extremist groups who were supportive of Islamabad's foreign policy towards India and Afghanistan. The lack of a strategy and the state support offered to some groups has led to a growing mood of defiance among extremist organisations. In the past few weeks five bloggers have disappeared (three, including liberal activist Salman Haider, have now returned home), some threatened journalists and civil society activists have fled abroad, non-governmental organisations have been accused of being unpatriotic, the Ahmedi community has been ferociously attacked and minority Shia Muslims have been massacred. Hate speech has become a growing phenomenon in some media outlets, especially television, while increasingly journalists and others are threatened with being charged with blasphemy, against which there is little legal defence. Innocent lives are at risk as public incitement and witch hunts continue. Earlier this week, Hafiz Saeed, the cleric blamed by the US and India for masterminding the Mumbai attacks, was placed under house arrest. The move is being seen as a response to suggestions by US officials that the Trump administration may ban his Jamaat-ud-Dawa charity, seen by the US as a front for terrorists. However a military official said it was \\"a policy decision\\" and had nothing to do with any foreign pressure. A key aspect of the growing defiance of extremists is the insistence that Pakistan's neighbours are to blame for acts of terrorism rather than recognising that it is a home-grown problem. When former army chief Gen Raheel Sharif took over the army three years ago, he repeatedly said that the country must look into itself to counter extremism and not blame foreign powers. That was music to the ears of most Pakistanis, who hoped that the state would tackle the very real threats at home rather than blame outsiders. Yet over the past year the state has been insisting that all major acts of terrorism have been perpetrated by India or Afghanistan, rather than domestic terrorists. Meanwhile, the civilian government has been indecisive and hesitant as to who to blame, while in its home base of Punjab it has clearly been allowing extremist groups to flourish. The conflict between civil and military agencies has left the public bewildered, giving further space for extremist ideas to flourish. This confusion has clouded out the need for a common and united narrative as to how to deal with extremism. So far, the new army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa has not categorically restated that terrorism is a domestic rather than a foreign creation. Meanwhile, relations with India and Afghanistan have worsened and other neighbours have distanced themselves from Pakistan, leading to what many experts have claimed is the country's growing isolation in the region. If Pakistan is to defeat extremism, a comprehensive strategy and common narrative, jointly agreed upon by the military and the politicians, needs to be implemented. Both need to ensure that all parts of the state are fully carrying out their responsibilities. Most importantly, the narrative that government agencies build up must be consistent and carry forward badly-needed social reforms that will promote de-radicalisation of young people. Pakistan needs a single, inspired, pragmatic and inclusive narrative that is strictly adhered to and can raise the public's morale instead of adding to their confusion.

Context: The Titans won their first game of the year, and Vince Young earned his first NFL win in a game against the Washington Redskins at FedExField. The Titans got on the board first as K Rob Bironas connected on a 32-yard field goal five minutes into the game. The Skins responded with a 10-yard touchdown run by RB Clinton Portis. On the first play of the second quarter, Skins QB Mark Brunell hit TE Chris Cooley with a 24-yard touchdown pass. Titans K Bironas converted a 26-yard field goal, and Young hit WR Brandon Jones with a 3-yard touchdown near the end of the first half, to pull the Titans to within one going into halftime. Titans RB Travis Henry rushed for a career-high 178 yards and scored on a 2-yard run in the third quarter. On the Skins next possession, Titans FB Casey Cramer blocked a Derrick Frost punt out of the end zone for a safety. Skins RB Portis ran for his second touchdown early in the fourth quarter, and Brunell hit WR Santana Moss for the two-point conversion to tie the game at 22. Titans K Bironas kicked a field goal from 30 yards out with 5 minutes left to give them a 25-22 lead. The Skins had one last chance but Brunell threw an interception to S Lamont Thompson to seal the deal for the Titans. With the win, the Titans went into their bye week at 1-5.

In response, the Redskins scored a touchdown with a 10-yard run by RB Clinton Portis, but this play took place after the first quarter had ended. Therefore, the Titans scored more points in the first quarter with 3 points compared to the Redskins' zero points during that period."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The world number one came through 2-6 6-1 7-6 (7-0) 6-1 against the Japanese eighth seed at Roland Garros. The 30-year-old goes on to face Swiss third seed Stan Wawrinka, who beat Marin Cilic 6-3 6-3 6-1. It is a repeat of last year's semi-final, which Murray won in four sets before going on to lose in the final. \\"Stan has played fantastic this tournament so far,\\" said the Scot, who was beaten by Novak Djokovic in last year's showpiece. \\"Last year when we met he was playing very well and I had to play one of my best matches on clay to beat him. \\"It's not always been easy for me here but the last few years have been great.\\" Nine-time champion Rafael Nadal will take on Dominic Thiem in the second semi-final, after the Austrian knocked out defending champion Djokovic. After impressive wins in the previous two rounds, Murray claimed another fine result, albeit in less clinical fashion. The pair shared 12 breaks of serve on another blustery Paris day, with Nishikori starting superbly but fading as Murray reeled him in. Nishikori, 27, broke serve twice to take the first set as his groundstrokes had Murray constantly on the defensive. Murray's mood was not improved by an early time violation from umpire Carlos Ramos, but it took another in the second set to fire up the top seed. The Briton remonstrated with the official before returning to the action, fired by injustice, roaring \\"Let's go!\\" as he clinched the game. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide. The first streak of Nishikori brilliance was over and the Japanese player double-faulted to drop serve at 3-1, and then woefully misjudged leaving a ball that landed well inside the baseline to fall 5-1 down. Nishikori twice fell a break behind with poor service games in the third set only to hit straight back each time, infuriating Murray, who served for the set at 6-5. It might have been expected to shift the momentum in Nishikori's favour, but he played a desperate tie-break and Murray reeled off all seven points. A brilliant piece of trademark Murray scrambling helped secure the decisive break midway through the fourth set and Nishikori's challenge was as good as over. \\"Come on!\\" screamed Murray as he broke again for a 5-1 lead before closing out the match with one of his easier service games of the afternoon. The momentum of the match switched sharply after umpire Carlos Ramos penalised Murray the loss of a serve for a time violation. Murray later said any delay was down to him missing a ball toss. \\"Obviously for a couple of points after that I was fired up, because I was frustrated at that moment,\\" he said. \\"It felt to me like it was a strange decision. I have never seen anyone get a warning after they have missed the ball toss. I have never seen that. \\"So I was frustrated about it, but I don't know how much impact that had.\\" Swiss third seed Wawrinka set up another Paris semi-final with Murray after breezing past seventh seed Cilic in the last eight. The three-time Grand Slam champion, 32, cruised to a 6-3 6-3 6-1 win against the Croatian in an hour and 40 minutes. Wawrinka, who won the Roland Garros title in 2015, has still not dropped a set in Paris this year. He is the oldest man to make the last four since Jimmy Connors in 1985. \\"It was perfect today, I'm very satisfied,\\" Wawrinka said after his 12th win in 14 meetings with Cilic. Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent In terms of performance, this was a backward step, but Murray still managed to beat the eighth seed with relative comfort to reach yet another Grand Slam semi-final. Murray was far from his best but, after an excellent first set, Nishikori was very poor. His contribution to the all-important third set tie-break was to make three forehand unforced errors, three backhand unforced errors and serve a double fault. Murray's display will not give Wawrinka any sleepless nights, but he will remember how outstandingly well the world number one played to beat him in four sets in last year's semi-final.

Translate to English English:","completion":"For every worker and company adversely affected by import competition, there is one or more workers and companies that expect to benefit from access to foreign markets. In other words, while some workers and businesses may face challenges due to global trade and increased competition from imported goods, others are likely to see new opportunities and growth as a result of engaging in international markets. The effects of import competition on workers and firms are not universally negative or positive; instead, they differ depending on the industry and the overall context of the economy. When access to foreign markets is expanded, some companies can benefit greatly by exporting their products or services, which can lead to new revenue streams and the potential for increased sales and profits. These exporting companies might have increased demand for their products or services, which can also lead to job creation for workers who might have been negatively impacted by import competition in other industries. However, when import competition rises, it is often the case that domestic firms that produce similar goods or services may face greater challenges in maintaining their market share and profitability. This competition can lead to price pressures and erode profit margins, which might result in job losses or business closures in some cases. The impact of import competition on firms and the labor market will, therefore, vary depending on the specific industries involved and the competitive environment within which they operate. Measures that can help mitigate the negative impact of import competition on domestic industries and workers include retraining and education programs for workers, government support for businesses to innovate and adapt, and smart trade policies that take into account the needs and interests of all stakeholders."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph: Nucleic Acids The nucleic acids differ in their type of pentose sugar. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is nucleotide that stores genetic information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus one phosphate group and one nitrogen-containing base. The “choices” of base for DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic code as protein. RNA contains ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the “choices” of base for RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. The nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines. A purine is a nitrogen-containing molecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine (found in DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. A pyramidine is a nitrogen-containing base with a single ring structure Bonds formed by dehydration synthesis between the pentose sugar of one nucleic acid monomer and the phosphate group of another form a “backbone,” from which the components’ nitrogen-containing bases protrude. In DNA, two such backbones attach at their protruding bases via hydrogen bonds. These twist to form a shape known as a double helix (Figure 2.29). The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that act as a molecular code instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000 genes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which lose their nuclei during development). These genes carry the genetic code to build one’s body, and are unique for each individual except identical twins. Q: Deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) is nucleotide that stores what type of information? A: Answer:","completion":"Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a nucleotide that stores genetic information.

Another asteroid, called 2015 TB145, is set to pass within 310,000 miles of Earth on Halloween. Back in August, in response to a viral conspiracy theory, NASA released a statement denying that Earth would be struck by a large asteroid a few weeks hence, causing widespread destruction. It turns out that the space agency was right. But what about the one headed our way on Halloween? An asteroid is anticipated to come within 310,000 miles of Earth – about a third longer than the average distance to the moon – its nearest approach is estimated at 11:14 a.m. Eastern on October 31, according to NASA. Called 2015 TB145, the asteroid was spotted by astronomers on October 10 using the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) at the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy. NASA estimates the space rock measures between 984 and 1,542 feet in diameter and is traveling \\"unusually fast,\\" according to the space agency, at about 78,000 miles per hour. \\"The flyby presents a truly outstanding scientific opportunity to study the physical properties of this object,\\" NASA said in a statement. NASA's Near-Earth Object Project has been detecting so-called Near-Earth objects since 1998, coordinating efforts worldwide with hundreds of other programs and astronomers to locate, track, and research potentially dangerous asteroids and comets that could come close to Earth. According to NASA, no known object poses an imminent threat, but a more grassroots approach sprung up in 2013 to help catalogue those space rocks that have yet to be identified. Called the Grand Challenge, the NASA program asks amateur astronomers around the world to help NASA \\"track all asteroid threats to human populations, and to know what to do about them,\\" Jason Kessler, the director of the program said in an interview with CNN. \\"We have discovered about 95% of the one kilometer or larger asteroids, that's roughly the size of the one that is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs upon impact,\\" Mr. Kessler said. \\"Unfortunately we only know about roughly 1% of those asteroids that get down to the 30 meter size, so there's a tremendous amount out there that we have yet to discover.\\" He added that, although the data sounds menacing, \\"Nothing we know of is threatening Earth right now.\\" As of October 16, 13,256 Near-Earth objects (NEOs) have been identified; of those, 1,635 have been classified as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) due to their size. ||||| Learn more about asteroids: A strikingly spooky asteroid is expected to whiz curiously close to Earth on Halloween, NASA has announced.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the march that Kevin Maguire calls, \\"a heroic failure\\"? from the following article ? Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group... A:","completion":"The full name of the march that Kevin Maguire calls \\"a heroic failure\\" can be inferred as the \\"Jarrow Crusade\\" or \\"Jarrow March\\" based on the mentioned article. The Jarrow March took place in 1936 when around 200 unemployed workers from Jarrow, a town in the northeast of England, marched over 300 miles to London in protest against mass unemployment and extreme poverty in their town. The march was organized to bring attention to the dire situation in Jarrow and to urge the government to provide proper relief measures. Although the Jarrow Crusade was supposed to be a powerful statement about the plight of the unemployed and the need for government intervention, the march did not yield immediate results in terms of employment opportunities or more support for the affected population. However, as the quoted historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart argue, the march played an important role in shaping post-Second World War perceptions of the 1930s and likely contributed to the eventual social reforms and improvements in working conditions. In the years since, the Jarrow March has become a symbol of the fight against poverty and unemployment. Consequently, political figures from the Labour Party have often referenced the event as a testament to the importance of addressing these issues head-on."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, what is your weight in newtons? An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force. Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon?

The option '+ no' is incorrect. According to the given paragraph, the force of gravity does change when you move from one celestial body to another, because the force of gravity is dependent on the mass of the celestial body. In this example, because the Moon's mass is less than the Earth's, the force of gravity is weaker on the Moon.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Fact 1: Being burried under soil and mud changes vegetation into peat through extreme heat and pressure in a swamp over a long period of time. Fact 2: Bogs are characterized by cushion-like vegetation and an accumulation of peat. Given the two facts above, what has its soil and mud changed by extreme heat over long periods of time? A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it can be concluded that peat is the substance formed as a result of the soil and mud being subjected to extreme heat and pressure over long periods of time. Fact 1 states that, in a swamp environment, extreme heat and pressure cause vegetation to transform into peat when it is buried under soil and mud. This process occurs over an extended period, which implies that it is a gradual and ongoing transformation influenced by the environmental conditions of the swamp. Fact 2 highlights that bogs contain cushion-like vegetation and an accumulation of peat. This implies that bogs are an ideal environment for the formation and preservation of peat due to their unique ecological characteristics. Bogs, like swamps, often have waterlogged conditions, providing an ideal setting for the breakdown of organic material, which then leads to the formation of peat. The two facts together suggest that peat is a crucial component of both swamp and bog ecosystems, formed by the prolonged exposure of vegetation to heat and pressure in waterlogged conditions. As a result, it can be deduced that the soil and mud in these ecosystems are changed by extreme heat over long periods of time, resulting in the formation of peat. This peat then plays a critical role in the overall functionality of swamp and bog habitats, serving as a carbon sink, providing insulation for plants, and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Answer the following question: As a boy, Sanders was much influenced by books about the sea, but by the age of fifteen he had decided to become a doctor rather than a sailor. His father was a doctor. So he was often with the doctors and got along very well with them. When he was fourteen, he was already hanging around the hospital where he was supposed to be helping to clean the medicine bottles, but was actually trying to listen to the doctors' conversations with patients in the next room. During the war Sanders served in the army as a surgeon . \\"That was the happiest time of my life. I was dealing with real sufferers and on the whole making a success of my job.\\" In Rhodes he taught the country people simple facts about medicine. He saw himself as a life-saver. He had proved his skill to himself and had a firm belief that he could serve those who lived simply, and were dependent upon him. Thus, while in a position to tell them what to do he could feel he was serving them. After the war, he married and set up a practice deep in the countryside, working under an old doctor who hated the sight of blood. This gave the younger man plenty of opportunities to go on working as a life-saver. When the war was over, he _ . A) had the happiest time of his life B) started to hate the sight of blood while working C) served the countrymen under an old doctor D) had few chances to be a \\"life-saver\\" because he was younger Answer:","completion":"C) served the countrymen under an old doctor After the war, Sanders married and started a new chapter of his life. He set up his medical practice deep in the countryside, where he had the opportunity to work closely with an older doctor who had a strong aversion to the sight of blood. This arrangement worked in Sanders' favor, as it provided him with numerous opportunities to continue working as a life-saver and utilizing his skills as a doctor. Throughout his life, Sanders was driven by a passion for helping others and making a difference in people's lives. His early fascination with books about the sea had initially led him to consider a career as a sailor; however, his exposure to the medical profession through his father, who was a doctor, ultimately inspired him to become a doctor himself. As a teenager, Sanders would hang around the hospital, seeking every opportunity to learn from experienced doctors and immerse himself in the world of medicine. During the war, Sanders served as a surgeon in the army, which he considered the happiest time of his life. He relished the opportunity to work with real sufferers and, by and large, felt that he was successful in his role. While stationed in Rhodes, he took it upon himself to teach the local population about basic medical knowledge, cementing his self-image as a life-saver. Once the war was over, Sanders' decision to set up his practice in a remote area of the countryside allowed him to continue his mission of serving others by providing medical care to those who depended on him. Working under an older doctor who disliked the sight of blood, Sanders was given the chance to take on more responsibilities and prove his life-saving abilities time and time again. This experience further reinforced his conviction that he could make a difference in the lives of those he served, as long as he was in a position to guide them and offer them the necessary care. In summary, after the war, Sanders chose to serve the countrymen under an old doctor, which allowed him to continue making a meaningful impact on the lives of his patients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: What is the most common non-contagious disease in the world?","completion":"The most common non-contagious disease in the world is dental caries, also known as tooth decay or cavities. Dental caries is a chronic, non-communicable disease that affects a significant portion of the global population, regardless of age, ethnicity, or socio-economic status. Dental caries occurs when the bacteria in the mouth produce acid that erodes tooth enamel and dentin, leading to the formation of cavities. The process begins with the buildup of plaque – a sticky film of bacteria that accumulates on the teeth, especially in areas where brushing and flossing may be less effective or challenging to reach. When carbohydrates, such as sugar and starches, are consumed, the bacteria within the plaque produce acid as they break down these carbohydrates. This acid attacks the tooth enamel, causing it to lose minerals and weaken over time. If the process continues without intervention, the enamel and underlying dentin can decay, and cavities develop. There are several factors that contribute to an individual's risk for developing dental caries. Some of the prominent factors include: 1. Poor oral hygiene: Inadequate brushing and flossing habits can result in the buildup of plaque on the teeth, increasing the risk of cavities. 2. Diet: Consuming foods high in sugar and starches contributes to the production of acid by oral bacteria, and frequent snacking can lead to prolonged acid attacks on tooth enamel. 3. Fluoride exposure: Fluoride is a mineral that helps to strengthen tooth enamel and protect against demineralization. Access to fluoridated water or using fluoride toothpaste can reduce the risk of dental caries. 4. Dental anatomy: Teeth with deep grooves and fissures may be more prone to decay, as food particles and bacteria can become trapped and harder to clean effectively. 5. Medical conditions: Conditions like dry mouth (xerostomia) due to the lack of saliva can increase the risk for caries, as saliva helps to neutralize acid, wash away food particles, and remineralize tooth enamel. Additionally, medical conditions like diabetes can impair the immune system, making it more challenging for the body to fight off oral bacterial overgrowth. 6. Genetics: Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to dental caries, including factors like enhanced enamel solubility, weaker tooth enamel, or a more significant susceptibility to oral bacteria. It's essential to maintain a good oral hygiene routine to prevent dental caries, which includes brushing for two minutes twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, flossing daily, and visiting a dentist for regular check-ups and cleanings. Limiting the consumption of sugary and acidic foods and beverages is also important, as well as considering dental sealants for teeth with deep grooves and fissures. Utilizing supplemental sources of fluoride, such as mouth rinses and professionally applied varnish, can help to further strengthen the enamel and lower the risk of cavities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Domnule președinte, consider că dezbaterea pe care tocmai am ascultat-o denotă faptul că avem multe de învățat din această criză a produselor lactate. Translate to English","completion":"Dear Mr. President, I believe that the debate we have just listened to indicates that we have much to learn from this dairy crisis. The dairy crisis that we are currently experiencing is a complex and multifaceted issue, pointing to a larger systemic problem in our agricultural and food industry. Several factors have contributed to this crisis, including fluctuations in global demand, changes in agricultural policies, and environmental concerns. As we listen to the various perspectives presented in the debate, it becomes evident that we need to analyze and learn from this situation to avoid future challenges and ensure a sustainable and prosperous dairy industry. One of the most prominent factors driving the dairy crisis is the volatility of the global demand for dairy products. As the world's population grows and increasingly adopts a more diversified diet, the demand for dairy has changed. Additionally, trade policies and shifts in regional production have disrupted traditional trade patterns, further complicating the dairy market. To better understand and cope with these issues, we must develop a long-term strategy for managing market risks and ensuring price stability. Another important factor is the changes in agricultural policies that have led to imbalances in the dairy market. Overproduction has resulted in a surplus of dairy products, which has put tremendous pressure on farmers to compete in a saturated market, often at the cost of environmental sustainability and animal welfare. Learning from this crisis, we must re-examine our agricultural policies to ensure they support sustainable practices while providing fair incentives to producers. Environmental concerns are also at the heart of the dairy crisis. Climate change, water scarcity, and soil degradation have all impacted dairy production, with potentially devastating consequences for the long-term viability of the sector. The debate should serve as a wake-up call, prompting us to prioritize environmental stewardship and support initiatives aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change on the dairy sector. Moreover, we must not overlook the importance of innovation, research, and development in addressing the dairy crisis. By investing in new technologies and practices, we can improve the efficiency of dairy production and reduce its environmental footprint. Meanwhile, encouraging stronger collaboration between industry stakeholders can help to identify best practices for increasing sustainability and profitability in the dairy sector. Lastly, as the dairy crisis affects not only producers but also consumers, it is crucial that we address the issue of food waste and promote responsible consumption habits. Educating consumers about the environmental and social impacts of our food choices and encouraging them to support local producers can help build a more resilient and sustainable food system. In conclusion, the dairy crisis presents us with a valuable opportunity to learn from the challenges faced by the industry and rethink our approach to agricultural and food policies. By adopting a more systemic perspective, prioritizing sustainability, and investing in innovation, we can help ensure the future prosperity of the dairy sector and the wellbeing of both producers and consumers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn?, using the article: John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest. A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas., what would be the answer ?

On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

His recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and potential immigration reform, along with his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, have temporarily improved his approval rating.

Question: Q: What term is used to describe changes to an organism’s dna and are an important driver of diversity in populations? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Mutation Mutations are changes to an organism’s DNA and are an important driver of diversity in populations. Species evolve because of the accumulation of mutations that occur over time. The appearance of new mutations is the most common way to introduce novel genotypic and phenotypic variance. Some mutations are unfavorable or harmful and are quickly eliminated from the population by natural selection. Others are beneficial and will spread through the population. Whether or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is determined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and reproduce. Some mutations do not do anything and can linger, unaffected by natural selection, in the genome. Some can have a dramatic effect on a gene and the resulting phenotype.

The lab works on spiders and has even managed to create new species of spiders through genetic manipulation and combination. While Peter is taking photographs of Mary Jane for the school newspaper, one of these new spiders lands on his hand and bites him. Peter comes home feeling ill and immediately goes to bed. At the genetic level, the venom injected by the spider bite begins to work strange magic on Peter.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales.

The capital is Guatemala City, which also serves as the national capital. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - El Salvador, officially the Republic of El Salvador (literally \\"Republic of The Savior\\"), is the smallest and the most densely populated country in Central America. El Salvador's capital and largest city is San Salvador. , the country had a population of approximately 6.38 million, consisting largely of Mestizos of European and Indigenous American descent. - Honduras, officially the Republic of Honduras, is a republic in Central America. It has at times been referred to as Spanish Honduras to differentiate it from British Honduras, which became modern-day Belize.

The gap begins in Yaviza, Panama and ends in Turbo, Colombia, stretching between 100 km and 160 km (60100 miles) long. Roadbuilding through this area is expensive, and the environmental cost is high. Political consensus in favor of road construction has not emerged. Consequently there is no road connection through the Darién Gap connecting North America with South America and it is the missing link of the Pan-American Highway. - A road is a thoroughfare, route, or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of conveyance, including a motor vehicle, cart, bicycle, or horse. - The Pan-American Highway is a network of roads measuring about in total length.

Article:","completion":"Title: Exploring a New Kind of Base in Math Hey little buddy! Today, we're going to learn about a new and exciting idea in the big world of math. It's called a \\"different type of base.\\" You know how our fingers and toes are a group of ten? That's because we usually count using tens. But, guess what? We can actually count in other ways too, like for example, using an entirely brand new base. So, let's start with understanding what a \\"base\\" is in math. Imagine you have a group of toys, like five cars and five action figures. When you put them together, they make a group of ten toys. That's because, our normal counting system is based on tens (like our fingers and toes). This counting system is called Base-10, which is also known as the decimal system. Every time we reach ten, we start over and just add another number to the next place. Now, imagine if we used a different number to count. Maybe, we decide to use eight as our special number. This would be called Base-8 or the octal system. So, when we reach eight, we start over just like we did with ten. The same idea applies to any other special number, no matter if it's big or small. A different type of base can be really cool for solving some tricky math problems or even for giving secret codes to our best friends. Some people, like super smart computer scientists, even use a base called binary (Base-2) for talking to computers. They only use two numbers, one and zero, to create an entire language. Isn't that amazing? So, next time you're playing with your toys or counting your candies, try to imagine what it would be like to use a completely new number as your base. Who knows? You might discover an exciting new way to count or even create a special code that only you and your friends can understand.

You are presented with the question \\"what has a positive impact on an animal 's ability to be a carrier for life?\\" and the following answer choices: - four limbs - staying frosty - staying isolated - prolactin release - staying warm - staying mad - coded genes - organic molecules Now knowing that staying warm has a positive impact on an animal 's survival and animals that survive develop an immunity, but are also carriers for life, choose the best answer. The answer to this question is:","completion":"staying warm. Now let's provide a detailed and long answer to explain why staying warm is the best choice among the given options: Temperature plays a defining role in an animal's ability to survive, reproduce, and function. In the context of an animal's ability to be a carrier for life, staying warm is crucial as it directly contributes to an animal's survival, metabolism, and immune response. When an animal is exposed to cold temperatures, its metabolism slows down, and the immune system's efficacy may be compromised, making it more challenging to fight off pathogens effectively and less likely to survive in general. Maintaining a stable body temperature ensures the optimal functioning of the animal's immune system. An intact immune system is more capable of encountering pathogens and developing a resistance or immunity to them. This immunity allows the animal to serve as a potential carrier for life without actually suffering the consequences of the infections they may host. Temperature can influence this phenomenon in different ways. 1. Metabolic rate: Warm-blooded animals, such as mammals and birds, have the ability to maintain a stable body temperature regardless of external environmental conditions. This thermoregulation aids in metabolism processes and ensures the animal can efficiently function and generate the energy required to keep its immune system active. 2. Immune response: The immune system works optimally when an animal's internal temperature is kept within a specific range. Low body temperatures can impair the immune system's function and hinder the body's ability to produce essential cytokines and antibodies. Staying warm thus helps an animal maintain its innate and adaptive immune responses that can combat pathogens and contribute to the carrier status. 3. Protection against pathogens: Warmth acts as a natural defense mechanism against certain pathogens. Many bacteria, viruses, and parasites struggle to survive in warm and stable environments. Thus, staying warm can help an animal prevent or fight infections more effectively. It's essential to note that while staying warm is undoubtedly beneficial to an animal's survival, it's not the only factor that determines its ability to be a carrier for life. Other factors include genetics, exposure to pathogens, and overall health status. However, among the options listed, staying warm stands out as the best choice due to its direct impact on an animal's survival and immune system, which in turn can lead to an increased likelihood of carrying pathogens without exhibiting symptoms or suffering from the illness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The legislature voted in 1810 to relocate the capital again, and moved the seat of government to Harrisburg in October 1812 onto the land originally given by Harris a decade earlier. An additional 10 acres (4 ha) was also purchased from United States Senator William Maclay. The legislature met in the old Dauphin County courthouse for the next decade until a new capitol was constructed. A competition was held to determine the design of the capitol starting in 1816, which \\"was the first formal contest for [designing] an American statehouse\\". The designs submitted, including one from William Strickland, were rejected as being too expensive. Another contest was started in January 1819. Of the seventeen designs submitted, two were selected as semifinalists. One was from Harrisburg architect Stephen Hills and the other was from the designer of the Washington Monument, Robert Mills; Hills' design was selected. Hills had designed a \\"red-brick, Federal-style\\" capitol to \\"architecturally represent the function of democratic government.\\" Construction began on the Hills Capitol in 1819 and it was completed in 1822. The capitol's construction and subsequent furnishing was estimated to have cost 244,500. The Hills Capitol was visited by famous people, including the Marquis de Lafayette in 1825 and Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, (later King Edward VII) in 1860. Abraham Lincoln visited the capitol in 1861 as president-elect, and then his body lay in state there after his 1865 assassination.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the aria Puccini considered eliminating because it held up the action?, using the article: In the second act of Tosca, according to Newman, Puccini rises to his greatest height as a master of the musical macabre. The act begins quietly, with Scarpia musing on the forthcoming downfall of Angelotti and Cavaradossi, while in the background a gavotte is played in a distant quarter of the Farnese Palace. For this music Puccini adapted a fifteen-year-old student exercise by his late brother, Michele, stating that in this way his brother could live again through him. In the dialogue with Spoletta, the \\"torture\\" motif—an \\"ideogram of suffering\\", according to Budden—is heard for the first time as a foretaste of what is to come. As Cavaradossi is brought in for interrogation, Tosca's voice is heard with the offstage chorus singing a cantata, \\"[its] suave strains contrast[ing] dramatically with the increasing tension and ever-darkening colour of the stage action\\". The cantata is most likely the Cantata a Giove, in the literature referred to as a lost work of Puccini's from 1897.Osborne describes the scenes that follow—Cavaradossi's interrogation, his torture, Scarpia's sadistic tormenting of Tosca—as Puccini's musical equivalent of grand guignol to which Cavaradossi's brief \\"Vittoria! Vittoria!\\" on the news of Napoleon's victory gives only partial relief. Scarpia's aria \\"Già, mi dicon venal\\" (\\"Yes, they say I am venal\\") is closely followed by Tosca's \\"Vissi d'arte\\". A lyrical andante based on Tosca's act 1 motif, this is perhaps the opera's best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake; he considered eliminating it since it held up the action. Fisher calls it \\"a Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing a woman who has lived unselfishly and righteously\\". In the act's finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil which follows Tosca's stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. After Tosca's contemptuous \\"E avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!\\" (\\"All Rome trembled before him\\"), sung on a middle C♯ monotone (sometimes spoken), the music gradually..., what would be the answer ?

To provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, let's elaborate further on Li Zicheng's background and his role in history: Li Zicheng (1606 – 1645) was a Chinese rebel leader who contributed significantly to the fall of the Ming Dynasty that ruled China for nearly three centuries. Born into a peasant family, Li Zicheng started his life as a shepherd and later turned to a life of banditry. His life changed significantly after he was recruited into the Ming military under the command of a military official named Gao Yingxiang. The Ming Dynasty was plagued by economic hardship, social unrest, and rampant corruption; the military proved to be no exception. In the early 1630s, Gao Yingxiang's forces switched their allegiance and became rebels against the Ming government. Li Zicheng followed suit and rapidly rose through the ranks due to his strong leadership abilities and strategic mind. By 1635, Gao Yingxiang had been captured and executed by the Ming forces, making Li Zicheng the de facto leader of the rebellion. The rebel forces grew under Li Zicheng's leadership, making significant strides in their fight against the Ming Dynasty. In April 1644, the capital at Beijing was sacked by a coalition of rebel forces led by Li Zicheng. At this critical juncture, Li declared himself the Emperor of a newly established, short-lived Shun Dynasty. It is important to note that Li Zicheng's ascension to the throne was short-lived as the Ming Dynasty itself was soon replaced by the Qing Dynasty. The Qing Dynasty, founded by Manchu leaders, had been expanding their territory and saw the weakened state of the Ming Dynasty as an opportunity to consolidate power. In July 1644, the Qing forces led by Manchu Prince Dorgon defeated Li Zicheng's forces in the Battle of Shanhai Pass, forcing Li to flee and effectively ending the Shun Dynasty. Li Zicheng continued to lead his rebel forces after the fall of the Shun Dynasty, albeit with diminishing success. Unable to regain power, Li ultimately died in 1645 either by suicide or by being killed by a group of peasants, depending on the historical account. In conclusion, Li Zicheng was a rebel leader who contributed to the fall of the Ming Dynasty and the establishment of the short-lived Shun Dynasty. He started as a peasant and became a key military figure leading a coalition of rebel forces in China. His role in history was significant, and the statement provided, while accurate, can be expanded upon to better understand his background and the context of his actions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It might involve the use of specific rat-killing techniques or products to control the rat issue. In essence, the first is about prevention and the second is about elimination.

Designed by Hüseyin Bütüner and Hilmi Güner, this imposing monument pays homage to the Ottoman Army soldiers who tragically lost their lives during the fierce fighting of the Battle of Baku. Constructed from an elegant combination of red granite and white marble, the Baku Turkish Martyrs' Memorial stands both as a symbol of remembrance for the fallen and tribute to the resilience of human courage in extraordinarily difficult times. The stark contrast between the white marble and red granite becomes a poignant visual representation of the heartbreaking loss of life, adding an evocative emotional depth to the structure. The battle which precipitated the creation of this memorial was part of the larger context of World War I and the Caucasus Campaign. Ottoman forces and their allies clashed with British, Armenian, and Russian armies in a series of conflicts over the critical city of Baku. The casualties from these battles were significant, and many of the fallen Ottoman soldiers are honored here at this memorial. Thus, the Baku Turkish Martyrs' Memorial serves as an enduring reminder of the cost of conflict and the sacrifice made by many in the name of duty. The memorial acts as a poignant place of reflection and respect, allowing visitors to appreciate the deep historical connections between Azerbaijan and Turkey, and understand the shared historical experiences that have shaped their respective national identities. The monument allows for the past to become a living part of the city's landscape, educating future generations about the critical historical events that have forged the city, and, indeed, the nation's identity. The combination of the memorial's somber purpose, its striking architectural design, and the historical context that incited its creation make the Baku Turkish Martyrs' Memorial an important and symbolic structure in the rich tapestry of Azerbaijan's historical and cultural landscape, representing the intertwined history and enduring brotherhood between Azerbaijan and Turkey. Every element, from its design to its location, contributes to the narrative of remembrance, making it a deeply significant monument in the heart of Azerbaijan's capital, Baku."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Coming off their hard-fought win over the Ravens, the Broncos traveled to Arrowhead Stadium for an AFC West duel with the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday Night Football. There was no scoring in the first quarter, which included cornerback David Bruton forcing a fumble off Chiefs' running back Jamaal Charles at the Broncos' 6-yard line. The Chiefs grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with Charles rushing for a 34-yard touchdown, then added to their lead, when cornerback Marcus Peters returned an interception off Broncos' quarterback Peyton Manning 55 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos responded with two touchdown passes by Manning &#8212; a 16-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders followed by a 1-yard juggling touchdown catch by tight end Virgil Green just before halftime. The latter scoring play came after Chiefs' quarterback Alex Smith was intercepted by cornerback Aqib Talib deep in Chiefs' territory. That was Talib's 2nd pick in as many weeks. The two teams exchanged field goals in the third quarter &#8212; a 35-yarder by Chiefs' placekicker Cairo Santos and a 54-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Brandon McManus. Following an exchange of punts, the Chiefs were attempting to re-claim the lead midway through the fourth quarter, when Smith was intercepted by cornerback Chris Harris, Jr. at the Broncos' 10-yard line with 6:40 remaining. However, the Broncos went three-and-out, and were forced to punt. The Chiefs took a 24-17 lead six plays later, with running back Knile Davis rushing for an 8-yard touchdown with 2:27 left in the game.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Drinking wine in moderation improves the IQ and may boost mental agility in old people,according to Japanese researchers. A study of the effects of alcohol on the middle aged and elderly found the average IQ of men who drink wine (whether made from grapes or rice) was 3.3 points higher than that of men who do not imbibe. Similarly,the IQ of women drinkers showed an improvement of 2.5 points over their teetotal sisters.The findings are part of an ongoing study by Japan's National Institute for Longevity into the links between human intelligence and what we eat and drink. The tests measured general knowledge,powers of judgment and concentration in drinkers and non-drinkers over 40,all living in Aichi prefecture,central Japan,and sharing the same income level-roughlyPS50 000 a year--and educational background.All were university graduates. But while wine-drinkers appeared to be brighter,the same was not true of those who drank deer,shochu (a local gin) and whisky. \\"The benefits of wine and sake (rice wine) in raising IQ could be due to substances they contain,such as polyphenol,which are believed to slow the ageing process,\\" Hiroshi Shimokata,head of epidemiology research,said. It was premature to conclude,he added,that drinking wine or sake slowed the deterioration of brain functions in the elderly,or warded off senility.The research does,however,suggest that this is one way to stay mentally alert longer. But there is a sobering caveat:drinking too much may make you dimmer.\\"People who drink more than 540 milli-litres (a little over a pint) of sake or wine a day had lower intelligence quotients than those who did not drink at all,\\"Hiroshi Shimokata said.\\"Moderation is very important.\\" Question: According to the passage,which of the following is NOT wrong?

C: Drinking beer and whisky cannot improve one's IQ. D: Drinking wine can only do good to the IQ of rich old people. The answer is:","completion":"C: Drinking beer and whisky cannot improve one's IQ. Let's justify the answer step-by-step: A: The passage states that the average IQ of men who drink wine is 3.3 points higher than that of men who don't drink. It doesn't say that every wine drinker's IQ is higher, so this statement is wrong. B: The passage says that the IQ of women drinkers is 2.5 points higher than that of non-drinking women, not lower. So this statement is wrong. C: The passage doesn't mention any benefits for those who drank beer, shochu, or whisky. It only focuses on the benefits of wine and sake. Therefore, it's not wrong to infer that drinking beer and whisky cannot improve one's IQ. D: The passage states that the test subjects were all living in Aichi prefecture, sharing the same income level and educational background. However, there's no specific mention that wine only benefits the IQ of rich old people. So, this statement is wrong.

With enough time, flowing water can dissolve it. Moving water also has the ability to move small pieces of rock and soil. How can water move a rock? Doesnt it need energy? Of course, water gets its energy because it is moving. Moving water has kinetic energy. Things that have more energy can do more work. When water stops moving it will have no energy. It will no longer be able to move the rock and soil. When this happens the rock and soil will settle to the bottom of the calm water. Scientists call this process deposition.

The paragraph does not mention anything about flowing water causing a stream to boil. According to the paragraph, flowing water can cause sediment such as rocks and soil to move.

Furthermore, the paragraph mentions that water can also dissolve rocks over lots of time due to its mineral content, basically engaging in the process of chemical weathering. The kinetic energy possessed by moving water drives these processes, demonstrating the impressive power and persistence of nature's elements. When water stops moving, its energy diminishes, causing the sediments it was carrying to settle at the bottom.

The premise provides information about a man wearing a black shirt who is holding a short-haired woman. We can assume that there is a scene with two people involved.

Record keepers were on hand inside the apartment to witness the event and a doctor was in place in case of a medical emergency. \\"Around the second day we started having minor hallucinations we started seeing writing on the screen that wasn't there,\\" said Fragoso. He began Friday morning and wrapped up Tuesday around 6 a.m. Even the slightest look away from the screen will get you disqualified. You're allowed a five minute break every hour to eat, use the restroom or just close your eyes. \\"When you're not in that designated rest time you had to be staring at the TV.\\" Fragoso started off with two friends but in the end he was the last one standing. One friend dropped out early on but Fragoso feels guilty about the second friend, Molly Ennis, who was disqualified during one of Fragoso's five minute breaks. \\"She actually dropped because my phone alarm went off when I was taking a power nap and she just glanced away to push the phone toward me, trying to help me out,\\" Fragoso said. Fragoso said he started to get a little stir crazy. \\"You forget there's an outside world at that point you're trapped in this tiny room.\\" Ninty-four hours was enough to break the Guinness World Record. The previous record, 92 hours, was set in March by a group of Austrians. \\"We chose a list of shows prior. We watched Battlestar Galactica, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Game of Thrones,\\" said Fragoso. \\"On the final day there were a few hours I forgot. The doctor said that's micro naps the body is forcing us to take.\\" When asked if he would try to break his own record, Fragoso admitted \\"I would not do it again I would not recommend it but it's a really cool story.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short explanation of something bigger.

Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table below ). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb. Phyllis and Meredith have the exact same diet and are both going to see a dietician for suggestions about what they should eat. Phyllis is currently five months pregnant and wants to see if she should do anything differently in regards to her food consumption. Meredith is not pregnant, but still wants to go to see if her diet is acceptable. Which woman's diet will most likely include more red meat? A:","completion":"Phyllis Step 1: Identify the purpose of the question. The question asks which woman's diet will most likely include more red meat based on their different needs for iron intake. Step 2: Determine the iron needs for both individuals. Phyllis is five months pregnant and needs 27 mg of iron daily, while Meredith is not pregnant and her age is not specified so we assume that she is an adult, which means she would need iron intake in line with adult women's recommended daily allowance (approximately 18 mg for non-pregnant women). Step 3: Compare their iron needs. Phyllis requires a significantly higher amount of daily iron (27 mg) compared to Meredith (approximately 18 mg). Step 4: Determine which diet will have more red meat based on the iron needs. Red meat, such as beef, is a good source of iron. Since Phyllis' iron needs are higher in her current pregnant state, it is reasonable to conclude that her diet will most likely include more red meat compared to Meredith's. Answer: Phyllis"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the sentiment of the following review?

Let's solve the equation step by step like we are talking to a five-year-old. We have this equation: -61 * r - 2,862,306 = -2,857,975 Our task is to find the value of r. To do that, we first need to get rid of the big number on the left side of the equation (-2,862,306). So, we will add 2,862,306 to both sides of the equation. -61 * r - 2,862,306 + 2,862,306 = -2,857,975 + 2,862,306 The big number on the left side (-2,862,306) and the one we added to it (2,862,306) cancel each other, and we get: -61 * r = 4,331 Now, we only have to deal with \\"-61 * r\\". To find the value of r, we have to break that multiplication by dividing both sides of the equation by -61: (-61 * r) / -61 = 4,331 / -61 The -61 on the left side cancels each other: r = -71 So, the solution to the equation is r = -71."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No; Based on the provided premise, it appears that the hypothesis \\"The technology installation for NOX and mercury control can be plugged in by the owner without any prior knowledge or resources.\\" is not true. Since Chapters 3 and 4 review the resource requirements of installing NOX and mercury control technology, respectively, we can infer that there must be some complexities and significant resources needed for the proper installation and functioning of these control technologies. The need to review resource requirements in separate chapters implies that the process may involve a variety of factors and considerations to be taken into account. This could include technical expertise, financial investments, physical and infrastructural requirements, and compliance with relevant regulations and standards in the industry. Furthermore, the proper functioning of NOX and mercury control technologies may include nuances and intricacies that demand a certain level of understanding and experience on the part of the installer. For instance, the operation may require adherence to strict safety measures for the handling of hazardous materials and gases, the acquisition and installation of specialized components, and the involvement of skilled technicians to ensure the optimal functioning of the control technology. In light of the premise provided, it's evident that the hypothesis underestimates the complexity of the installation process for NOX and mercury control technologies. The implementation of such technologies may pose significant challenges to individuals without prior knowledge or resources, and as a result, it is not accurate to claim that an owner can merely plug in this technology without the need for intricate considerations and preparations. Ultimately, the hypothesis is not true, based on the premise's clear indication that resource requirements for installing NOX and mercury control technology are substantial enough to warrant separate chapters reviewing their complexities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies.

Change up your subjects.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Maximizing Your Learning Experience: A Comprehensive Guide to Effective Reading Strategies Introduction In today's fast-paced world, where numerous new information and ideas are continually added to the wealth of knowledge that already exists, it is imperative that individuals develop effective reading strategies to retain and understand information quicker. One such method to maximize the learning experience is by employing an active reading approach that involves digesting information systematically. This article outlines various techniques and strategies for becoming an active reader, including skimming chapter content before a thorough study, taking detailed notes, restating key concepts in one's own words, immediately reviewing the material, and incorporating subject diversity. 1. Skim Each Chapter Before Reading Before diving into a chapter's main content, it is essential to scan for vital parts such as headings, subheadings, and any highlighted text. This quick skim will provide an overall framework for the upcoming material and aid in better understanding the chapter's purpose and organization. Consequently, it will prepare the reader's mind, facilitating comprehension and recall of critical points. 2. Read the Chapter Closely and Take Notes Active reading is the key to assimilation and retention. Engaging with the content closely and critically helps delve deeper into the subject and comprehend the author's intended message. Additionally, taking notes while reading serves several purposes. Firstly, it keeps the reader's mind focused on the material, promoting better understanding, and secondly, it creates a concise summary of essential points, which can be utilized during revisions. 3. Be an Active Reader While reading, continuously search for connections between the material and previously acquired knowledge. Drawing parallels between new and existing information helps enhance understanding and retention. Furthermore, stay engaged by asking questions that stimulate your curiosity about the topic, visualizing the information, annotating the text by writing brief summaries or highlighting essential sentences, and outlining the chapter to document important ideas and their respective relationships. 4. Restate Key Concepts in Your Own Words Another beneficial active reading strategy is paraphrasing critical concepts in your own words. This technique encourages the mind to grasp the material and promotes deep-level processing. This self-translation of information, from the author's words to the reader's understanding, ensures that the extracted meaning is distilled and consolidated, thus being easier to remember. 5. Review Everything You've Read as Soon as You Finish the Chapter The human mind tends to forget the details quite rapidly. Therefore, a quick review of the chapter is crucial immediately after completing the reading. This process reinforces the mental connections initially formed, enhances retention, and helps commit the information to long-term memory. Revisiting the notes taken during the reading process aids in consolidating and organizing the material in the mind. 6. Don't Try to Do It All at Once It is essential to avoid overwhelming the mind with information by tackling large chunks of content in one sitting. Instead, breaking down the reading material into smaller, more manageable sections will facilitate a better understanding and retention. Taking regular breaks, practicing effective time management and being mindful of one's attention span can significantly enhance the learning experience. 7. Change Up Your Subjects Studying a variety of subjects helps retain interest and engagement while reading. Furthermore, this approach stimulates the mind and prevents monotony, which may lead to exhaustion and poor comprehension. Continuously varying the topics of study not only sparks curiosity and motivation but also contributes to the development of a well-rounded knowledge base. Conclusion In this era of information overload, investing time and effort into developing effective reading strategies is essential for anyone striving for academic or professional success. By becoming an active reader and implementing the techniques described, including skimming chapter content, taking detailed notes, restating key concepts in one's own words, reviewing the material immediately, and incorporating subject diversity, it is possible to maximize the learning experience and acquire the required knowledge efficiently and effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The complaint should also include statements about the jurisdiction and venue of the court, a request for service upon the defendants, and a prayer for relief, asking the court to compel the parties to interplead. 3. Attach Required Documentation: Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be required to attach specific documents to the complaint, such as a sworn affidavit or a copy of the disputed property or funds. Consult the local rules and procedures to ensure compliance with these requirements. 4. Pay the Filing Fee: File your complaint and other required documents with the appropriate court, along with the required filing fee. The fees vary by jurisdiction, so contact the court clerk's office to determine the amount. 5. Serve the Defendants: After filing the complaint, you must serve copies of the complaint and any other required documents on each defendant. Service of process rules vary by jurisdiction, so consult the local rules to determine the acceptable methods, such as service by mail or personal service by a sheriff or process server. 6. Await Response from Defendants: Once service is complete, the defendants have a specified amount of time, usually 20-30 days, to respond to the complaint by either filing an answer, in which they admit or deny the allegations and present any defenses, or by filing a dispositive motion, such as a motion to dismiss. 7. Participate in Court Proceedings: If the case proceeds, the parties will engage in the discovery process to exchange information and evidence. The court may schedule hearings, conferences, or settlement negotiations, which you must attend and participate in as required. 8. Attend Trial, If Necessary: If the parties cannot reach a settlement agreement, the case may proceed to trial. At the trial, you will present evidence and arguments to persuade the court to resolve the dispute in your favor. 9. Comply with the Court's Judgment: After the court issues its judgment, you must comply with the terms. This may include distributing any disputed property or funds to the determined rightful claimant(s) and paying any associated costs or fees. In conclusion, an interpleader does not begin with a video, as mentioned earlier, but rather with a complaint and subsequent steps to initiate a legal action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. My daughter was away at college preparing for her final exams and nursing boards. I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred. I thanked her for the 14 years she had been one of my daughter’s closest companions and I held her as she took her last breath. I was afraid my daughter was going to be angry with me when I told her that i made the decision with out giving her time to say goodbye.

As someone who enjoys authentic Italian cuisine and has been lucky enough to travel to Italy, I always appreciate when a restaurant can transport me back to those wonderful times, and \\"La Dolce Vita\\" did just that! Upon entering the restaurant, I was immediately impressed by the warm and welcoming atmosphere. The interior was beautifully designed, with tasteful art pieces and well-executed lighting that created a truly inviting dining environment. The attention to detail was impeccable, from the crisp table linens to the elegantly arranged table settings, not to mention the cozy seating arrangement that made the place feel intimate and inviting. The service at \\"La Dolce Vita\\" was outstanding. Our friendly and attentive server, Maria, greeted us with a genuine smile and provided helpful recommendations based on our preferences. Throughout the meal, she was quickly available to refill our wine glasses, answer our questions about the menu, and made sure everything was to our liking. The service team worked seamlessly together, ensuring that our experience was flawless from start to finish. Now, let's talk about the food – truly the star of the evening. We started with a delightful antipasto platter that featured a variety of high-quality cured meats, cheeses, olives, and crusty bread. The flavors and textures blended beautifully, creating an excellent start to what would be an unforgettable meal. For our main courses, I ordered the homemade fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken, while my partner chose the seafood risotto. The fettuccine was cooked to perfection, with a delicate, creamy sauce that was neither too heavy nor too light. The grilled chicken was tender and flavorful, providing just the right touch of contrast to the pasta. The seafood risotto was equally impressive, packed with succulent shrimp, scallops, and clams – truly a seafood lover's dream. The rice was cooked perfectly, with a creamy consistency and just the right amount of seasoning. To cap off our meal, we shared a delectable tiramisu, which was hands-down the best I've ever tasted. The layers of espresso-soaked ladyfingers, rich mascarpone cream, and cocoa powder came together in perfect harmony, creating a dessert that was both indulgent and light, the perfect end to our meal. Overall, \\"La Dolce Vita\\" provided an exceptional dining experience that I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a high-quality Italian meal.

If \\"A man wearing a dark colored shirt is holding a swaddled baby who is yawning.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The man is holding a baby.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"The man is holding a baby.\\" This is due to the following step-by-step reasoning: 1. The initial statement describes: \\"A man wearing a dark colored shirt is holding a swaddled baby who is yawning.\\" This gives us valuable information about a certain scene or situation. 2. In this sentence, the primary subject is “a man wearing a dark colored shirt.” What is he doing? We understand from the phrase that follows, \\"is holding a swaddled baby,” that the man is holding a baby. 3. The baby being \\"swaddled\\" and \\"yawning\\" are merely adjunct details; they elaborate on the situation but do not change the core fact that the man is holding a baby. 4. Thus, from the initial statement we can logically extract the secondary statement: \\"The man is holding a baby.\\" This secondary statement is a simplification of the initial statement, maintaining the vital detail related to the man’s action without discarding its validity.

First, eliminate the options that do not make sense in the context of the question. \\"Pay debts\\" is not a place and therefore cannot be the answer. 2. Next, consider the remaining options: \\"fort,\\" \\"pirate ship,\\" \\"battle,\\" and \\"war museum.\\" 3. Evaluate the correctness of each remaining option: a. \\"Fort\\" - Cannons were historically used in forts to defend against enemy attacks and protect the territory. This option makes sense in the context of the question. b. \\"Pirate ship\\" - Although cannons were used onboard pirate ships, the question specifically asks about \\"on land.\\" Pirate ships aren't usually found on land, so this option is less likely. c. \\"Battle\\" - Cannons were definitely used in battles, but this answer is more of a scenario rather than a specific location. Based on the context of the question, this is not the best option. d. \\"War museum\\" - Cannons can indeed be found in war museums as exhibits to showcase their history and use in battles. This option should be considered as a valid answer. 4. Compare the valid options: \\"fort\\" and \\"war museum.\\" Both options are places where you could likely find a cannon, but since forts were designed specifically for their use and defense, \\"fort\\" is the more likely choice. Therefore, the correct choice is \\"fort\\" because cannons were historically used as a means of defense and attack in forts, making it the most appropriate and likely place to find one on land."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This does not address the given question in terms of any quantity or count of camera phones. A more detailed and accurate answer would involve discussing the number of camera phone models present in the market, which is constantly increasing due to the technological advancements and the growth of the mobile industry. To provide a thorough answer, we could look at various aspects, such as the history of camera phones, how they have evolved over time, and what factors contribute to the continuing growth of their popularity. In the early 2000s, when camera phones were first introduced, the number of models available was limited. Since then, the number of camera phones in the market has increased dramatically, as mobile phone companies continue to release new models with better capabilities. This growth is driven by multiple factors, including consumer demand for better image quality and the role that social media has played in popularizing the sharing of photos and videos. Today, there are thousands of camera phone models available, ranging from budget-friendly options to flagship devices with sophisticated multi-lens systems and advanced features. Each year, major mobile brands such as Apple, Samsung, and Huawei release new camera phone models, continuously improving the image quality and adding innovative features.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What do Arkham's inhabitants do to the warlock? In 1765, the inhabitants of Arkham, Massachusetts, are suspicious of the strange phenomena surrounding the grand \\"palace\\" that overlooks the town. They suspect the palace's owner, Joseph Curwen, is a warlock. A young girl wanders up to the palace in a trance-like state. She is led by Curwen and his mistress, Hester, down into the dungeons. The girl is subjected to a strange ritual, in which an unseen creature rises up from a covered pit. The townspeople observe the girl wandering off, and they storm the palace to confront its owner. Though the girl appears unharmed, the townspeople surmise that she has been bewitched to forget what happened to her. They drag Curwen out to a tree where they intend to burn him. The mob leader, Ezra Weeden, insists that they do not harm Hester (to whom he had been previously engaged to marry). Before being burned alive, Curwen puts a curse on Arkham and its inhabitants and their descendants, promising to rise from the grave to take his revenge. In 1875, 110 years later, Curwen's great-great-grandson, Charles Dexter Ward, and his wife Anne arrive in Arkham after inheriting the palace. They find the townsfolk hostile towards them and are disturbed by the horrific deformities that afflict many of Arkham's inhabitants. Charles is surprised by how well he seems to know the palace and struck by his strong resemblance to a portrait of Curwen. He and Anne meet Simon, the palace caretaker, who persuades them to stay at the palace and to forget the townspeoples' hostility. Charles becomes more and more obsessed with the portrait of Curwen, and at times seems to change in his personality.

The film stars Wallace Reid, Anita King, Tully Marshall, Guy Oliver, Walter Long and Mrs. Lewis McCord. The film was released on January 25, 1917, by Paramount Pictures. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Reid became famous after The Golden Fetter .","completion":"After the release of The Golden Fetter on January 25, 1917, Wallace Reid's career did receive a boost, though it is essential to analyze his entire career to understand the factors that contributed to his fame. Wallace Reid was already an established actor before The Golden Fetter, having started his acting career in the early 1910s and working with various directors and production companies. Reid's association with Paramount Pictures had begun with the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, which eventually became a part of the Paramount Studios. Through the course of his career, he worked on numerous films, each adding to his growing popularity. However, The Golden Fetter indeed played a role in cementing Reid's status as a leading man in the motion picture industry. It was around this time that Reid began to appear in more romantic films, showcasing both his acting skills and his on-screen charisma. In this 1917 release, Wallace Reid convincingly portrayed the male lead, with the storyline revolving around romance, adventure, and action. The film was well-supported by a talented cast, including Anita King, Tully Marshall, Guy Oliver, Walter Long, and Mrs. Lewis McCord, all contributing to positive reviews and commercial success. While it cannot be said that Reid had suddenly become famous after The Golden Fetter, it is clear that the film was integral in shaping the trajectory of his career. His subsequent film roles were greatly influenced by his performance in The Golden Fetter, with producers and directors often offering him romantic hero parts. As Reid continued to work on more successful films in the following years, his popularity grew further, turning him into one of the biggest stars of the silent film era. In conclusion, it would not be entirely accurate to say that Wallace Reid became famous solely because of The Golden Fetter, considering his previous work and accomplishments. Nevertheless, the film was undoubtedly a significant milestone in his career, showcasing his range as an actor and opening doors for him to play more romantic lead roles. As Reid's work garnered praise and admiration from both critics and fans, his fame continued to grow, eventually solidifying him as a major Hollywood star of the silent film era."},{"prompt":"Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that began composing Little Galop?, using the article: Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

On his last day, he realizes that none of his colleagues care enough about him to say good-bye to him, instead leaving him a cake with an insult made out of icing. Driving out west in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster, Stone swerves to miss a cow on the highway and crashes uncontrollably into the fence of a local resident in the rural hamlet of Grady, South Carolina. The resident is local Judge Evans, who sentences him to community service at the nearby hospital as punishment rather than allow Stone pay for the fence with cash. Defeated and stranded due to the damage to his car, Ben reports to the local clinic, where Nurse Packer further humbles him by recording his community service hours by clocking him in and out, like a factory worker. Though upset, Ben makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson, who is also the owner of the town's cafe, and Melvin, the local mechanic tasked with repairing his car. Ben soon finds the clinic work is more laid-back than the emergency room to which he is used with simple cases, such as spots before the eyes of an elderly patient not cleaning her glasses, fishing hook impaling and even reading mail for a young illiterate couple, Kyle and Mary Owens, whose baby he later delivers.

It ends with an informal game of football between staff and pupils and a long hand-held shot of an empty classroom. The camera never leaves the school. The film is set in the staff room, the playground, the dining room, the principal's office, a conference room, and the classroom where FranÃ§ois Marin (FranÃ§ois BÃ©gaudeau) teaches French (i.e., language arts) to a mixed group of 13- and 14-year-olds. The film centers around Marin and the various experiences he has with students in his French literature class. The class is difficult, as Marin is unable to relate to his students due to his ethnicity and class status . Marin makes various attempts to try and garner trust and respect from his students but fails miserably . At the students protest of their dislike of the required reading material Anne Frank due to lack of cultural relevance, Marin tries to gain insight into the lives of his pupils. He assigns them to write self-portraits which describe their aspirations, hobbies and dislikes. These are eventually collated by Marin who creates an end-of-year book with them. Most of his students respond positively to this assignment including Soulemayne, a student from Mali whom Marin allows to complete a photographic autobiography . However all this new found trust and respect that Marin gets from his students quickly dissipates after a faculty meeting in which two of his students are allowed to attend as class representatives . Marin would go on to make disparaging comments about one of his students in this meeting and even more disparaging remarks about the class representatives who would serve to be whistle blowers later on in the film .

We (and the band themselves) should accept the fact that Metallica are washed up.They sound like a broken down basement band devoid of creative fire and state of the art chops especially compared to new hungry outfits like Lamb of God for instance. That's not to say that a band of Metallica's stature should nessacarily be stacked up against other more recent bands who have youth and the benefit of building on the metal legacy Metallica themselves spearheaded but even on their own terms there is no excuse for putting out boring ill concieved and poorly executed material. Beyond a big let down more like the last straw.

He is arguably the most famous astronaut since Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin after performing David Bowie’s Space Oddity on his guitar while he was more than 200 miles above the Earth. To date, Commander Chris Hadfield’s video – shot in the International Space Station (ISS) – has had 25 million viewings on YouTube and even has the backing of the rock star himself, who declared it the most ‘poignant’ version of his hit. But as if that wasn’t enough, the ISS commander’s fan base has gone stratospheric after he used his free time on board the floating laboratory to snap a series of stunning photographs of planet Earth and upload them to the world via a NASA link after taking personal requests from people around the globe. The astronaut said: ‘ OPTIONS: - Buzz Aldrin said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - Canadian said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - Chris Hadfield said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - David Bowie said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - Earth said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - Edinburgh said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - Glasgow said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - Hadfield said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - ISS said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - International Space Station said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - Macmillan said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - NASA said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - Neil Armstrong said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - Space Oddity said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - The World In 92 Minutes said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - YouTube said it was the most poignant cover of his song. - planet Earth said it was the most poignant cover of his song.","completion":"Correct Answer: - David Bowie said it was the most poignant cover of his song.

Therefore, the correct answer would be: \\"David Bowie said it was the most poignant cover of his song.\\" Why Other Options are Wrong: - Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Chris Hadfield are astronauts, not singers or songwriters. They did not comment on the song cover. - 'Canadian', 'Earth', 'Edinburgh', 'Glasgow', 'International Space Station (ISS)', 'Macmillan', 'NASA', 'Space Oddity', 'The World In 92 Minutes', 'YouTube', 'planet Earth' are not people or entities associated with writing or performing the song. - The given context does not provide any information about any comments by these entities. - 'Hadfield' could seem a correct answer because Chris Hadfield performed the song.

Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can impact tumor growth and progression. The inhibitory CD200 receptor (CD200R) suppresses the activation of myeloid cells and lack of this pathway results in a reduction of tumor growth, conversely a tumorigenic effect of CD200R triggering was also described. Here we investigated the role of CD200R activation in syngeneic mouse tumor models. We showed that agonistic CD200R antibody reached tumors, but had no significant impact on tumor growth and minor effect on infiltration of immune myeloid cells. These effects were reproduced using two different anti-CD200R clones. In contrast, we showed that CD200-deficiency did decrease melanoma tumor burden. The presence of either endogenous or tumor-expressed CD200 restored the growth of metastatic melanoma foci. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that blockade of the endogenous ligand CD200 prevented the tumorigenic effect of CD200R-expressing myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment, whereas agonistic anti-CD200R has no effect on tumor development.","completion":"\\"Investigating the Role of CD200R Activation and Blockade in Tumor Growth and Immune Myeloid Cell Infiltration in Syngeneic Mouse Models\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Why is not tipping unfair in US? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"To answer these questions, let me clarify the context of each question: 1. Why is tipping considered unfair? This question asks about the reasons why some people view the practice of tipping as unfair in general, not necessarily only in the US context. To answer this question, I will consider various perspectives: - In some countries, tipping can be seen as unfair because it puts the burden of paying a fair wage on customers instead of employers. If wages were sufficient, tipping wouldn't be necessary. - Tipping can lead to arbitrary income differences between employees based on factors such as appearance, charisma, or luck, rather than work quality or experience. - Tipping culture might contribute to income inequality and perpetuate stereotypes. For example, in the US, tipping has been historically linked to racial dynamics and power structures. - Tipping can also create inconsistent income for workers, making it difficult for them to budget and plan for the future. 2. Why is not tipping unfair in the US? This question specifically addresses the reasons why not tipping is considered unfair in the United States. To answer this question, I will focus on factors related to the US labor market and tipping culture: - In the US, many service workers rely on tips to supplement their income due to low minimum wage laws for tipped workers. In some states, the minimum wage for tipped workers is lower than the regular minimum wage. - Tipping is ingrained in American culture, and consumers are generally expected to tip for services. It is seen as a way to reward or encourage good service, and not tipping can be perceived as a signal that the service was unsatisfactory. - Employees in the service industry might be paid significantly less by their employers with the expectation that they will earn tips. As a result, not tipping may contribute to financial insecurity for these workers. To answer the third question - Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? These two questions are related but not the same. The first question addresses more general arguments about why tipping is considered unfair, while the second question focuses on the specific US context and why not tipping is considered unfair in that context. The answers to these questions provide different perspectives on tipping culture and its implications for fairness and equity."},{"prompt":"Question: - Energy builds up in the crust of the earth - The energy causes the fault lines give way - The earth&#x27;s plates move - The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions What might be the last step of the process?

White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. According to the above context, answer the following question. Where will Trump send the National Guard to protect the US from drug smuggling? OPT: (1). the border of Canada and USA; (2). the border of Hawaii; (3). not enough information; (4).

Answer the following question: Why might I have never been ticketed while driving the Grand Marquis ?","completion":"To answer why you might have never been ticketed while driving the Grand Marquis, we can analyze the possible reasons step-by-step: Step 1: Examine the factors that contribute to being ticketed Common reasons people get ticketed include speeding, reckless driving, running red lights or stop signs, parking violations, or expired registrations. Step 2: Analyze the car's features The Grand Marquis is a large, comfortable sedan known for its smooth ride and unassuming appearance. It is not a sports car and might not tempt drivers to engage in high-speed or reckless driving. Step 3: Consider the car's appearance As you mentioned, the car seems to be \\"nigh invisible to The Authorities,\\" which could indicate that its appearance does not attract unnecessary attention. The Grand Marquis is not a flashy or eye-catching car; its design is simple and inconspicuous, which might make it less likely to be noticed by police officers monitoring traffic. Step 4: Evaluate your driving behavior You might be a cautious and responsible driver who follows traffic rules, which reduces your chances of being pulled over or ticketed. Based on these steps, it appears that a combination of factors might have contributed to your lack of tickets while driving the Grand Marquis.

Directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by George Lucas, the film introduced the world to the iconic character of Indiana Jones, a professor of archaeology who often finds himself embroiled in thrilling adventures and dangerous quests for priceless artifacts. The film's story revolves around Indiana Jones, played by Harrison Ford, who is hired by the US government to locate the Ark of the Covenant before a group of Nazis does. The Ark is believed to hold powerful supernatural powers that could aid the Nazis in their quest for world domination. Jones' journey takes him across multiple continents as he uncovers clues, navigates treacherous terrain, and faces numerous challenges in order to recover the Ark and ensure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" was a massive commercial and critical success, earning multiple awards, and cementing Indiana Jones as a beloved fictional hero for generations to come.

It is important to note that Washington sea otters faced near-extinction in 1910 due to hunting, and their resurgence only began in the late 1960s when some otters were relocated to the state from Alaska. With this case, the aquarium is raising awareness about the potential impacts of wildfires and other environmental factors on the health of marine animals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: California's governor has been asked to make the final decision on whether a former Charles Manson follower will be released on parole after serving more than 40 years in prison. The state's Board of Parole Hearings submitted to Gov. Jerry Brown its recommendation that Bruce Davis is suitable for parole. The documents were submitted Friday, one day ahead of the deadline, according to California Department of Corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton. The board's attorneys were required to review the findings of a two-member panel which ruled he was suitable for parole. They confirmed there were no errors of fact or law in the submission. The governor has up to 30 days to make a decision. His options are to affirm, decline, modify or decline to review, which would allow the parole to take effect, Thornton said. Davis, now 70, was convicted with cult leader Manson and another man in the killings of a musician and a stuntman. He was not involved in the infamous Sharon Tate murders. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger rejected a previous parole recommendation for Davis. Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey sent a letter to the board last week opposing Davis' release. Davis was 30 when he was sentenced to life in prison in 1972, in a case that was a postscript to Manson's notorious reign as leader of the murderous communal cult known as the Manson family. Davis long maintained that he was a bystander in the killings of the two men, but in recent years, he has acknowledged his shared responsibility. A recent photo released by CDCR shows a gray-haired, wrinkled man smiling for the camera. If he is freed, Davis will go to transitional housing associated with religious groups in Los Angeles County. Davis became a born-again Christian in prison and ministered to other inmates, married a woman he met through the prison ministry, and has a grown daughter. The couple recently divorced. Davis also earned a master's degree and a doctorate in philosophy of religion. Manson and three of his followers, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles \\"Tex\\" Watson, remain in prison for life in the Tate killings. Their co-defendant, Susan Atkins, died of cancer behind bars in 2009. ||||| Los Angeles & SoCal News Los Angeles & SoCal News More>> 7-Year-Old Girl Given A New Prosthetic Hand Made By A 3D Printer 7-Year-Old Girl Given A New Prosthetic Hand Made By A 3D Printer Build It Workspace is a storefront in Los Alamitos, where hobbyists and amateur engineer types can build all kinds of crafts and gadgets by using consumer friendly 3D printers.

Back in 1969, Manson led the group known as the Manson Family, which murdered eight people, including film director Roman Polanski's pregnant wife Sharon Tate. An attorney for one of the members of Charles Manson's violent cult said decades ago the group's leader committed more murders, according to a report. MyFoxLA.com reports Bill Boyd, who represented Manson family member and convicted murderer Charles \\"Tex\\" Watson, said Watson told him Manson had committed other murders besides the 1969 killings of actress Sharon Tate and six others. \\"He told me about a bunch of other people Manson had killed,\\" Boyd said of Watson. Boyd reportedly made the comments in an interview with an author about the murders, and MyFoxLA.com recently received an audiotape of the interview. Boyd also says on the tape Watson did not implicate himself, saying the murders Watson allegedly spoke of were unrelated to the ones Watson was involved in. Boyd, who died in 2009, said he had over 20 hours of recordings of interviews with Watson. MyFoxLA.com reports the LAPD is now seeking to get the tapes, which are tied up in Texas bankruptcy court. The news comes as California's governor has been asked to make the final decision on whether a former Manson follower will be released on parole after serving more than 40 years in prison. The state's Board of Parole Hearings submitted to Gov. Jerry Brown its recommendation that Bruce Davis is suitable for parole.

Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. Katie hires psychic Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie. He advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact demonologist Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously. The camera manages to capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and doors moving on their own. On the thirteenth night they were awoken at the sound of a screeching demon downstairs. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day. One day Micah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the planchette to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During the seventeenth night, Micah sprinkles baby powder in the hallway and bedroom. The couple are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic, where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie, previously thought to have been destroyed in an unexplained house fire. Katie finally calls the demonologist, Dr. Averies, but he is occupied. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is overwhelmed by the demonic energy upon entering.

Movie title: The Killing Movie plot: Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a veteran criminal planning one last heist before settling down and marrying Fay (Coleen Gray). He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying. Johnny, on his way to the apartment, sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong. He buys the biggest suitcase he can find to put the money in (and struggles to lock it properly). At the airport Johnny and Fay aren't allowed to take the suitcase along as hand luggage because of its size, and instead must check it in as regular luggage. Johnny reluctantly complies. While waiting to board their plane they watch as the suitcase falls off a cart onto the runway, breaks open, and the loose banknotes are swept away by the backdraft from the plane's propellers. Fay and Johnny leave the airport but are unable to hail a cab before officers... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Killing,\\" the police kill the sharpshooter played by Timothy Carey.

Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili conceded his party's defeat Tuesday, setting the stage for the nation's first peaceful, democratic transition through election since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Victory in the parliamentary elections went to a coalition headed by billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili. Ivanishvili is set to become the next prime minister. Saakashvili will remain president until presidential elections next year. The result of Monday's election means Georgia will have a multi-party parliament, boosting democracy in the nation, observers said. The vote also is a reflection of how the people feel about Saakashvili. He took power in 2004 after the Rose Revolution, the name given to widespread protests over disputed parliamentary elections. The billionaire said he had sold all his","completion":"businesses in Russia to devote himself to politics in Georgia, placing his wealth in a trust, and focusing on enhancing democracy and fighting corruption. He vowed to improve the economic situation of the country by attracting foreign investments, creating jobs, and ensuring the welfare of the citizens. In the months following the election, the new coalition government under Ivanishvili's leadership embarked on a series of political and economic reforms. They sought to tackle corruption, improve the country's infrastructure, and prioritize social welfare issues such as healthcare, education, and income inequality. The coalition worked closely with civil society organizations and international partners to draft legislation aimed at strengthening democratic institutions, promoting transparency, and encouraging public participation in the political process. Furthermore, Ivanishvili prioritized improving Georgia's relationship with neighboring countries, particularly Russia. Although tensions remained high, the two countries began to engage in dialogue, aiming to resolve long-standing territorial disputes and establish trade agreements. Ivanishvili's diplomatic efforts led to an increase in foreign investments and tourism, bolstering the Georgian economy. During this time, Saakashvili focused on completing his presidential term while preparing for a peaceful transition of power. Though there were instances of political disagreements and public protests, the government managed to maintain stability and avoid any significant escalation of conflicts. By the time presidential elections were held the following year, the political landscape had evolved, with various parties contesting for the presidency. In the presidential elections, a candidate from Ivanishvili's coalition emerged victorious, solidifying the coalition's control over the government. Saakashvili handed over power peacefully, marking a significant milestone in Georgia's path towards a stable democracy. The country continued on its way to consolidating democratic institutions and adhering to the values of a free and open society. In the years that followed, Georgia witnessed substantial economic growth, owing to the pro-business policies implemented by the government and increased foreign investments. The new leadership's emphasis on addressing social welfare issues led to improved living conditions for many citizens, though challenges remained. Moreover, Georgia's progress in establishing a democratic foundation attracted the attention of Western countries, particularly the European Union (EU), which began considering the possibility of granting Georgia membership status. While the process of joining the EU was lengthy and required further reforms, Georgia continued to move forward, committed to its path as a democratic nation. In conclusion, the story ends with Georgia experiencing its first peaceful democratic transition, solidifying its political institutions, and fostering economic growth. The country's progress set the stage for stronger relations with the international community and potential inclusion in organizations such as the EU. Although challenges persisted, Georgia emerged as a symbol of hope and determination for other nations striving to embrace democracy and overcome their past."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is the final step of the following process: - Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose - The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process involves the delivery of oxygen to the cells and tissues of the body and the exchange of oxygen with carbon dioxide, which is then carried back to the lungs to be expelled from the body. Let me provide a more detailed explanation of this final step. 1. Capillary network and oxygen diffusion: After erythrocytes, which contain oxygen-bound hemoglobin, are pumped through the body by the heart, they enter an extensive network of capillaries. Capillaries are extremely narrow with walls only one cell thick, allowing for efficient exchange of oxygen and nutrients with the surrounding cells and tissues. The oxygen carried by hemoglobin in erythrocytes diffuses through the capillary walls and into the interstitial fluid, which surrounds the cells and tissues of the body. 2. Cellular uptake of oxygen: Once in the interstitial fluid, oxygen molecules move by passive diffusion from an area of high concentration (the interstitial fluid) to an area of low concentration (inside the cells) through permeable cell membranes. Oxygen is utilized by cells for various metabolic processes, particularly in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a crucial molecule for storing and transferring energy in living organisms. 3. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production: During cellular respiration, which primarily occurs in cell organelles called mitochondria, oxygen serves as an electron acceptor in the electron transport chain to help produce ATP. As a byproduct of this process, carbon dioxide (CO2) is generated. Consequently, CO2 concentration within the cells increases. 4. Carbon dioxide diffusion and transport: Similar to how oxygen passively diffuses into cells, carbon dioxide diffuses out of cells and into the interstitial fluid due to a concentration gradient (low concentration in interstitial fluid, high concentration in cells). From the interstitial fluid, CO2 enters capillaries, binds to hemoglobin, bicarbonate ions, and plasma, and is transported back to the heart. 5. Expulsion of carbon dioxide: Upon reaching the heart, deoxygenated blood containing CO2 is pumped to the lungs. Once in contact with the thin walls of alveoli, the tiny air sacs in the lungs, CO2 diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli. This process reverses the mechanisms by which oxygen enters the bloodstream at the beginning of the process. 6. Exhalation: Finally, the accumulated carbon dioxide in the alveoli is expelled from the body during exhalation. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, decreasing the volume of the thoracic cavity, thereby increasing the pressure and forcing the CO2-rich air out of the lungs. This marks the completion of the respiratory process, including the oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide exchange. This cycle of oxygen intake, cellular utilization, and carbon dioxide removal is critical to sustaining life. The maintenance of this delicate balance ensures that cells receive the oxygen necessary to produce energy while simultaneously disposing of carbon dioxide, a waste product that can be toxic when accumulated in high concentrations within the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: italian central bank chief looking more isolated as pressure builds for resignation Text:","completion":"As tensions continue to mount, the Italian Central Bank Chief is finding himself increasingly isolated amidst intensifying demands for his resignation. At the heart of the matter, critics argue that the Chief's handling of recent financial crises has not instilled the public's confidence in the institution, leading to potential risks for the Italian economy. In recent times, there have been significant economic challenges faced by the Italian financial sector, including a slow recovery from the recession, high public debt, and long-standing issues with non-performing loans. The Central Bank Chief has been at the helm of these challenges, drawing attention to his leadership abilities. While some argue that the problems are structural, others suggest that the Chief's policies have failed to address the economy's weaknesses, placing the institution under increasing pressure. There have been calls from various stakeholders, including prominent political figures, economists and the general public, for the Central Bank Chief to step down from his position. The prevailing sentiment is that, in order for the Italian economy to regain both stability and consumer confidence, a change in leadership is necessary. This, in turn, has led to the Chief appearing more isolated in his position, as the criticism and pressure to resign grow louder. Furthermore, the international community has also raised concerns over the Italian Central Bank Chief's continued tenure. With Italy being a crucial member of the European Union and the Eurozone, the financial stability of the nation bears great importance on the overall health of the economic bloc. Despite the mounting pressure, the Central Bank Chief has yet to give any indication of his intentions regarding resignation. Instead, he has repeatedly defended his policies and track record, arguing that his decisions have been made solely for the benefit of the Italian economy. As the calls for his resignation grow louder, however, the isolation experienced by the Central Bank Chief serves as a testament to the precariousness of his position and the concerns surrounding his continued leadership."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The natives observe that the latter, if perfectly black, makes no good broth, nor is its flesh worth eating; but that a cormorant, which hath any white feathers or down, makes good broth, and the flesh of it is good food; and the broth is usually drunk by nurses to increase their milk. Similarly, Samuel Johnson noted that: At the tables where a stranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land so thinly inhabited, must have much wild-fowl; and I scarcely remember to have seen a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had.

Review: Some films are so bad that they're good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was about as true to the story as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. The acting was terrible, the direction was poor, and it travelled way too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home. Nor did Melissa Joan Hart ever strike me as a talented actress, but then every film she made was pretty low-budget anyway. Like most of her other films, she lets down her characters by hamming them up too much, talking too quickly as if speeding up her words is going to make her more dramatic. She really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and she's talking to a camera, when she should be engaging the viewer in her character. It pretty much lets down the whole film, and any leg that it may have had left to stand on, is ruined. Probably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end. But even that wasn't satisfying enough to subdue my loathing for such a bad film. Watch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast.

Although he was raised Jewish, Lehrer became an agnostic. He began studying classical piano at the age of seven, but was more interested in the popular music of the age. Eventually, his mother also sent him to a popular-music piano teacher. Context: In 1953, inspired by the success of his performances, Lehrer paid 15 for some studio time to record Songs by Tom Lehrer. The initial pressing was 400 copies. At the time, radio stations would not give Lehrer air time because of his controversial subjects. He sold his album on campus at Harvard for 3 (equivalent to 27.00 today), while \\"several stores near the Harvard campus sold it for 3.50, taking only a minimal markup as a kind of community service. Newsstands on campus sold it for the same price.\\" After one summer, he started to receive mail orders from all parts of the country (as far away as San Francisco, after The Chronicle wrote an article on the record). Interest in his recordings was spread by word of mouth; friends and supporters brought their records home and played them for their friends, who then also wanted a copy. Lehrer later recalled, \\"Lacking exposure in the media, my songs spread slowly. Like herpes, rather than ebola.\\" The album--which included the macabre \\"I Hold Your Hand in Mine\\", the mildly risque \\"Be Prepared\\", and \\"Lobachevsky\\" (regarding plagiarizing mathematicians)--became a cult success via word of mouth, despite being self-published and without promotion. Lehrer embarked on a series of concert tours and in 1959 recorded a second album, which was released in two versions: the songs were the same, but More of Tom Lehrer was studio-recorded while An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer was recorded live in concert. In 2013, Lehrer recalled the studio session for \\"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,\\" which referred to the practice of controlling pigeons in Boston with strychnine-treated corn: \\"The copyist arrived at the last minute with the parts and passed them out to the band... And there was no title on it, and there was no lyrics. And so they ran through it, 'what a pleasant little waltz'... And the engineer said, '\\"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,' take one,\\" and the piano player said, '\\"What?\\"' and literally fell off the stool.\\" Question: Did his music become popular? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Tom Lehrer's music did become popular despite the unconventional approach to promotion, distribution, and its controversial content. His debut album, Songs by Tom Lehrer, gained popularity through word of mouth, and he sold numerous copies on Harvard's campus and in nearby stores. The widespread interest in his music was also supported by mail orders from various parts of the country, indicating a growing fan base. Lehrer's unique brand of satire, mixed with music, struck a chord with many listeners who appreciated his wit, intelligence, and social commentary. This led to a series of concert tours, further enhancing his popularity. In 1959, he released a second album, More of Tom Lehrer, in two versions: a studio-recorded one and a live concert version called An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer. This demonstrated his growing fan base and the demand for his performances. Lehrer's music continued to gain popularity in the years that followed, thanks to his distinctive and clever blend of humor, societal critique, and unconventional subject matter. While his music may not have entered the mainstream to the same extent as other artists of the time, it certainly achieved a cult following. This popularity has endured to the present day, with Lehrer's work being regarded as an influential contribution to the genres of satire and musical comedy."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer the following question: Two climate experts studied different continent to observe climate changes. Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person observed a strong warming on the Antarctic Peninsula? Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The Seven and Five Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. Moore flirted with Surrealism, joining Paul Nash's modern art movement \\"Unit One\\", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the cave of Altamira (which he described as the \\"Royal Academy of Cave Painting\\"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings. In 1938, Moore met Kenneth Clark for the first time.

Process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Question: suppose there is more oxygen in the environment happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"C: no effect Despite an increased amount of oxygen in the environment, it will have no effect on a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. The reason for this is that the body has mechanisms in place to regulate the amount of oxygen it takes in and utilizes. The oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is primarily determined by the concentration of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that binds to oxygen. Hemoglobin has a natural affinity for oxygen, and under normal conditions, it will bind to oxygen molecules until it is about 98% saturated. This means that, regardless of the concentration of oxygen in the environment, your body will not significantly take up more oxygen than its usual capacity, as long as it is within the safe limits. However, it is worth noting that exposure to excessively high concentrations of oxygen can lead to oxygen toxicity, which can have harmful effects on the body, such as cell damage and organ failure. In these cases, the body may not be able to properly regulate the amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. But under typical conditions and assuming smaller amounts of oxygen are within safe, physiological limits, an increase in environmental oxygen will not affect the smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is I took the plunge and bought the DVD. That said everything previously mentioned about this film is true. For a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all. The list of problems with the film could drag on forever. Chief amongst them is the film is simply too long. It dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours. Nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly. Secondly, as many had pointed out from the \\"trailers\\", the special effects are anything but special. The tripods looked OK in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade-Z 1970's or 1980's quality. Probably the worst effects of all were the horses, which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved. The heat ray effects were laughable, as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles. Also pitiful was the Thunderchild sequence, in which the Thunderchild, described in the book as an ironclad ram, looked nothing of the sort. Instead it resembled a World War 1 era destroyer, complete with deck guns (which fired but had no visible crew), and torpedo tubes. The colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects. Most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out Mars to her in the sky. Well, the sky is black, but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight. There is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape, bathed in full sunlight, and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars. To detract even further, the color of the scenes made no sense. In some they are bathed in orange light. In others green light. In still others it's blue light. In some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue. The frame-rate and camera is very shaky, giving everything a stuttering look. Finally, the acting is overall sub-par. One man portrays two characters who's sole difference was one lacked a mustache. This led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were. The English accents, even to American ears, are outrageous. In summary, this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times. I have not seen Gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one, because of it's poor quality in every respect, must easily be worse then anything that mainstream Hollywood has put out.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that had their heir created in 1776? , can you please find it? In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish...

Question: what order was amended and superseded Executive Order 11246 Context: Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress. The answer is:","completion":"Executive Order 10925 was amended and superseded by Lyndon B.

You see, Kyle was a pescatarian, which means he chose to eat only fish, fruits, vegetables, and some other foods that came from plants. He would not eat any other type of meat, like chicken or beef. Kyle believed that fish was super healthy, so he included it in his normal diet. This made fish a really important part of his meals. On the other hand, Aaron was also a pescatarian, but his choice was a bit different than Kyle's. He would eat fish sometimes, but not as often as Kyle did. Aaron was more focused on eating lots of fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based foods. Fish wasn't a big part of Aaron's normal diet, even though he could eat it. So, when you compare their food habits, fish was a totally normal thing for Kyle to eat, but not really for Aaron. This is because both of them had different preferences and eating styles, even though they were both pescatarians.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: How can you tell if someone's lying? The answer is, they're probably not. Traditional economics says that people are rational beings who will lie if it's to their advantage. A recent university study has shown that, actually, we're pretty honest --especially when we're at home. Researchers in Germany phoned people at home and asked them to toss a coin. There was a strong financial incentive to fake the result: if the coin landed tails-up, the participants would receive money or a gift ticket, while if the coin landed heads-up, they would get nothing. Because they were on the phone, they knew there was no risk of getting caught if they lied. And yet people told the truth.Over hundreds of tosses, a coin will land tails-up roughly 50% of the time. In this study 0ver half the people asked (55.6%) said that the coin landed heads-up, which meant they would receive nothing. Previous studies had found that people were more dishonest. In those laboratory studies, 75% of people reported a winning coin and claimed a reward. So the research team thinks it's being in our own homes which makes us play fair, although it's not yet clear why. In fact both types of study show people are surprisingly reliable. Even in the laboratory, 25% of people turned down a reward by telling the truth. The researchers say this is because honesty is highly valued in human society.We care about our reputation and our sense of ourselves as respectable people. So lying has a psychological cost and it seems this cost is more important than the financialbenefits of lying . Options: A There was no risk of getting caught lying if people were on the phone.

The musketeers Answer:","completion":"Title: Shadows Of The Red Cloak Step 1: Introduce the main characters and the setting In 17th century France, the young and idealistic D'Artagnan seeks to become a member of the elite King's Musketeers, a group of skilled swordsmen sworn to protect the King and the Queen. He befriends three veteran Musketeers: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and together they form an inseparable bond. Step 2: Set the assassination scene Meanwhile, the power-hungry Cardinal Richelieu, who serves as the King's advisor, desires control over the throne. He secretly orchestrates an assassination attempt on the King, but it is foiled by the Musketeers' bravery and quick thinking. The King escapes unharmed, and D'Artagnan proves his worth to the Musketeers. Step 3: Introduce the Cardinal's blame The Cardinal, eager to save face and further consolidate power, places the blame for the attempted assassination on the Musketeers, accusing them of treason. He uses his influence over the King to convince him that the Musketeers are becoming a threat and must be disbanded. Step 4: The Musketeers' quest for proof Ignoring the King's order to disband, the Musketeers embark on a dangerous quest to prove their innocence. They encounter several obstacles, including soldiers loyal to the Cardinal, and uncover evidence that the Cardinal is in league with a foreign power, plotting to overthrow the French monarchy. Step 5: Fighting against the odds The Musketeers infiltrate the Cardinal's hidden lair, narrowly avoiding a series of deadly traps. They finally confront the Cardinal, who unveils his master plan: he and his foreign allies intend to assassinate the King and Queen to pave the way for his own rule, supported by a powerful army. Step 6: The final confrontation The Musketeers engage the Cardinal and his men in an epic sword battle. The odds are stacked against them as they face hordes of enemy soldiers. However, their skills, camaraderie, and determination ultimately win the day. They defeat the Cardinal and his men, saving the King and the Queen. Step 7: Clearing their names The Musketeers present the evidence of the Cardinal's treachery to the King. The King, grateful for their loyalty and heroics, formally pardons the Musketeers and reinstates them as his trusted protectors. The King also imprisons the Cardinal for his crimes against the crown. Step 8: Closing the story In the end, the Musketeers stand victorious, having overcome betrayal and great danger. D'Artagnan is officially welcomed into the ranks of the King's Musketeers, and together with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, they continue to serve the King and the Queen faithfully, living up to their motto: \\"All for one, and one for all.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choose your answer from: - no. - yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Bananas are healthy and nutritious fruits, but their impact on teeth whitening is a topic of debate. Question 1: How do bananas help to whiten teeth? Technically, bananas are not considered effective teeth whitening agents. However, some people believe bananas can contribute to whiter teeth due to the presence of certain minerals and nutrients. Bananas contain potassium, magnesium, and manganese, which could hypothetically contribute to strengthening the tooth enamel and maintaining the natural whiteness of teeth. Additionally, the act of chewing and swallowing bananas promotes saliva production, which is essential in washing away food particles and bacteria from the teeth. This, in turn, could contribute to the prevention of teeth staining. Question 2: Do banana peels really whiten teeth? Why or why not? The use of banana peels for teeth whitening is a popular home remedy, although scientific evidence to support its effectiveness is scarce. Advocates of this method claim that rubbing the inside of a banana peel on their teeth for a few minutes daily can lead to a gradually whiter smile. This is based on the belief that the high mineral content of potassium, magnesium, and manganese within the peel could contribute to teeth whitening by strengthening the enamel and removing surface stains. However, dental experts generally do not recommend using banana peels as a teeth-whitening method. The minerals found in banana peels may not be potent enough to cause any significant teeth whitening effect. Moreover, there is insufficient scientific evidence to back up the claims made by proponents of this method. It is important to note that most teeth stains occur beneath the enamel layer, and banana peels are unlikely to address this issue. For effective teeth whitening, it is more advisable to consult a dental professional and explore clinically proven methods such as dental bleaching treatments or over-the-counter whitening products. To answer your last question, the response to both questions is not a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no.\\" It is essential to emphasize that the impact of bananas and banana peels on teeth whitening is not scientifically proven to be effective. While there are some anecdotal accounts of people experiencing whiter teeth after using this home remedy, dental experts do not widely endorse this practice, as there is little to no scientific evidence backing its effectiveness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: WASHINGTON (AP)  Western officials are crediting a Saudi intelligence tip they received in early October, nearly three weeks before terrorists in managed to smuggle mail bombs onto airplanes, with heading off what could have been a series of catastrophic explosions on jets. The Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility Friday for sending the two bombs addressed to synagogues in the U.S. and intercepted in Dubai and Britain. The group also said it was responsible for the crash of a UPS cargo plane in Dubai in September and threatened even more attacks on passenger and cargo aircraft. Investigators say they believe the UPS crash was an accident, not a terror attack, but they're not discounting the al-Qaeda claim. \\"A terror act is an unlikely cause. But it doesn't mean we eliminate it,\\" said the head of the United Arab Emirates' civil aviation authority, Saif al-Suwaidi. \\"The investigation is ongoing. Of course we are investigating all possibilities.\\" The Saudi tip contained no mention of cargo planes, or any details of the plot carried out last week, said U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss classified matters. But they said it gave the U.S. and other Western officials enough of a warning to know what to look for when another Saudi tip arrived last week. A CIA spokesman Friday night cited several allies that have provided key intelligence about terrorist activities. \\"Over the past several months, we received intelligence — which was shared across our government — from our foreign partners about threats from AQAP and other terrorist groups,\\" said CIA spokesman George Little. \\"The United States receives this kind of information from other governments on a regular basis, as you would expect. Last week, we received specific intelligence that allowed the United States and our allies to disrupt the cargo plot. Our actions were swift and aggressive.\\" Another U.S. official said the Yemeni terror group's interest in plane attacks has been apparent since its failed Christmas Day attempt last year to bring down a Detroit-bound plane with explosives hidden in the underwear of a would-be suicide bomber. Both the Christmas attack and the mail bombs sent last week used a powerful industrial explosive, PETN, and the main bomb maker for AQAP is considered a top suspect in both attempts. But although the tip in October did raise alarms about a plane attack, it did not mention cargo planes, where the plot might originate or who the attackers might be, the official said. U.S. agencies had been monitoring steady intelligence on a possible attack since early September, one U.S. official has said. And in late September, authorities intercepted packages shipped to Chicago that are now seen as a likely test run by the terror group to gauge the logistics of shipping bombs by air to the U.S. On Friday, AQAP said it would continue to strike American and Western interests and specifically said it would target aviation. \\"We have struck three blows at your airplanes in a single year,\\" the group said in a message on a militant website. \\"And God willing, we will continue to strike our blows against American interests and the interests of America's allies.\\" The authenticity of Friday's claim could not be immediately verified. A U.S. intelligence official said authorities are not surprised to see this claim now. Authorities in the U.S. and the UAE have said the Sept. 3 crash of the UPS plane in Dubai shortly after takeoff was caused by an onboard fire, but investigators are taking another look at the incident. A security official in the UAE familiar with the investigations into the UPS crash in Dubai and the mail bombs plot told The Associated Press on Friday that there is no change in earlier findings and that the UPS crash in September was likely caused by an onboard fire. \\"There was no explosion,\\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under standing UAE rules on disclosing security-related information. A UPS spokesman, Norman Black, said his company had \\"no independent knowledge of this claim by al-Qaeda,\\" and noted that both UAE officials and U.S. National Transportation Safety Board officials have so far ruled out the possibility of a bomb as cause in the crash. In its statement, al-Qaeda's Yemeni offshoot said it \\"downed the UPS airplane but because the enemy's media did not attribute the act to us, we kept silent about the operation until we could return the ball once more. \\"We have done that, this time with two explosives, one of them sent via UPS, the other via FedEx.\\" It said its \\"advanced explosives\\" give it \\"the opportunity to detonate (planes) in the air or after they have reached their final target, and they are designed to bypass all detection devices.\\" Both mail bombs were hidden inside computer printers and wired to detonators that used cell-phone technology and packed powdered PETN. The message also directed a warning to Saudi Arabia, warning: \\"God's curse on the oppressors.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Depending on how many people you plan to invite, this may become physically exhausting. Handwritten invitations are immediately more personal than any typed font could be - it’s your own personal font! Agree on a format, split a stack of invitations with your partner and start writing. They will not all look the same, but that’s the point! Each invitation will be one of a kind. If writing the full invitations by hand is too time consuming, you can always type up the actual invitation and only write the name and address by hand. Envelopes can take many forms, both manufactured and homemade. The invitation itself can be folded into a type of envelope, but it’s recommended to place it inside of something else to avoid being damaged. But why use regular envelopes when you can make your very own personalized invitations! Create your own personalized envelope by vertically folding a standard sheet of paper into three equal sections. Unfold the paper then fold the two long edges in by an inch. Refold the bottom third onto the middle third and glue it in place on the edges. You now have a sealed pocket in which to place your invitation, then fold the remaining third down and seal it in place with tape or glue. If you are feeling more tech savvy and want to avoid the whole process of mailing invitations, create a website for your special day and share the link with those you want to invite. The website should contain details regarding time and locations of the ceremony and receptions. It should include further information for expected attire, parking, and a gift registry. You can include an option on the site to RSVP for themselves and whoever they are permitted to bring. Enabling guests to RSVP online is very useful as you have the further benefit of collating a database of guest's email addresses if you need to contact them with further details closer to the wedding. Many wedding websites have resources that can help you create your own site regardless of technical skill.","completion":"This article suggests creating personal handwritten invitations or using a website for your special day, including details like time, location, attire, parking, and gift registry, allowing guests to RSVP online for easy communication and planning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Combine facts and answer this: What helmet typically associated with the Prussian Army was replaced by a steel helmet during World War I?","completion":"The Pickelhaube helmet, typically associated with the Prussian Army, was replaced by the Stahlhelm (steel helmet) during World War I. The Pickelhaube was a spiked helmet made of leather, metal fittings, and a prominent spike on top. It was initially introduced by King Frederick William IV of Prussia in 1842, and eventually became a symbol of the German Empire's military forces. Although visually striking, the Pickelhaube offered limited protection in combat due to its lightweight materials and construction. With the outbreak of World War I, the limitations of the Pickelhaube became apparent as soldiers faced modern warfare with machine guns, artillery, and shrapnel. In response, the German Army introduced the Stahlhelm in 1916 to provide better protection for its troops. The Stahlhelm was made of steel, had a dome-shaped design, and featured a flared skirt to protect the wearer's neck and ears. This new helmet significantly improved the soldiers' survivability on the battlefield and eventually became an iconic symbol of the German military during both World Wars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It can be difficult to tell for sure whether or not a cat is feral or simply adventuring away from home. Both lost pet cats and feral cats may behave aggressively toward you or run off out of fear when you approach, so determining that a cat is feral may require subtle cues. Feral cats may appear to be better groomed than a lost pet cat that hasn’t gotten accustomed to living outdoors yet. If you start feeding the cat, pet cats will grow to trust you and behave like a pet whereas feral cats will remain skittish. Feral cats have existed around humans for thousands of years, and often don’t require any assistance from people to survive. These cats are not really homeless, they’re wild animals. Feral cats are not socialized to people, so they cannot be adopted as pets easily. Feral cats often live in social groups called colonies. If you see one, there are likely a number of other feral cats in the area. Feral cats probably do not need your help unless it appears sickly or weak. Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is a phrase used to describe a common population control method utilized with feral cats. TNR can improve a cat’s health, the health of its colony, and prevent an overpopulation of feral cats that could lead to some cats starving. After a feral cat has been vaccinated and neutered it can be adopted or returned to the area it was trapped. First, contact your local vet or animal shelter. They may offer TNR services for the community free of charge or for a reduced cost. They also may be able to offer assistance and traps. Next, you’ll need to safely Trap a Feral Cat. Negative behaviors associated with mating such as fighting and yowling stop after the cat has been neutered. After treatment the vet will help you determine if the cat should be re-released or put up for adoption. If a feral cat appears to be injured or sick, you may choose to help the cat regain its health. Remember that feral cats are wild animals, so the injury could make it aggressive. Also remember to keep your own health in mind when dealing with feral cats, especially ones that seem ill. Make sure to wash your hands after coming into contact with a feral cat. If the cat appears to simply be malnourished, do not attempt to bring it inside, but consider leaving food and water out for the cat to eat and drink when you aren’t around and it feels more comfortable. If the cat seems seriously ill or injured, do not approach it. Either entice the cat into a carrier or cage with food or place it there gently if it is not moving, then bring the cat to a local animal hospital for treatment. There are many shelters and animal hospitals that will care for stray cats at reduced or no cost. You can also call animal control in your town if you would rather not approach the animal yourself.","completion":"This article discusses distinguishing between feral and lost pet cats, noting that feral cats are not easily socialized, often live in colonies and may not need help, while providing guidance on using Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) for population control and offering advice on assisting injured or sick feral cats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

UPDATED:. 18:28 EST, 13 March 2013. The newly-announced Pope Francis is the first leader of the Catholic Church to hail from Latin America and his selection is being hailed as a triumph throughout the United States. President Barack Obama offered warm wishes to new Pope on Wednesday and said the choice of the Cardinal from Argentina to ascend to the papacy speaks to the vitality of increasingly important Latin America. Obama called the new pope 'a champion of the poor and the most vulnerable among us.' 'As the first pope from the Americas, his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world, and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans, those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day,' Obama said in a statement. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Balance of power: Newly elected Pope Francis I waves to the waiting crowd from the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica. Celebration: Faithful followers in St Peter's Square celebrated the historic pick. Though Pope Francis I hails from Argentina, he knows both Italian and German as well as Spanish. The new Pope's work in his native Argentina- where he is known as an austere Jesuit intellectual who modernized the country's conservative Catholic church- says a good deal about the future direction of the Church, as it is a clear signal of good faith towards heavily-Catholic Latin and South America. Represent: Catholics make up more than a fifth of the United States population. ‘For us to go into the Americas for. the very first time, and South America, is awesome,’ said church. assistant Catherine Sims who works at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church in. Libertyville, Illinois. ‘When he picks a name like that, it. tells you a lot about who he wants to emulate. Christ revealed himself. to St. Francis and said rebuild my church. If he’s taken a name like. that, and he’s from South America, we’re probably going in a new. direction with new leadership in the Vatican,’ she told The Chicago Tribune. The United States has a significant Catholic population, with Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate reporting that there were 66.3million Catholics in the country in 2012. That figure, originally reported by the Church itself, means that the faithful make up 21 per cent of the country's growing population of 313million. In New York, Monsignor Robert Ritchie of St. Patrick’s Cathedral seemed hopeful in an address to congregants. ‘I know God has chosen a holy father who will do exactly as he was told to do -- feed his sheep,’ he said on Wednesday. The decision is a landmark one for the traditionally Catholic countries of South America. 'For. the churches that are pilgrims in Latin America, it is the cause of. great joy,' said a statement from the Catholic bishops of Mexico. 'For the Mexican church, it is a clear sign of love for the churches that are pilgrims in these lands.' Grasping the news: Schoolchildren at St Paul Catholic School in Valpariso, Indiana watched as the smoke turned from black to white. People from both South and North America are thrilled about selection from the Western hemisphere. Rejoice: Teens at Lake Michigan Catholic High School in St Joseph, Michigan cheered at the selection. Groups of supporters waved Argentine. flags in St. Peter's Square as Francis, wearing simple white robes, made. his first public appearance as pope. 'Ladies. and Gentlemen, good evening,' he said before making a reference to his. roots in Latin America, which accounts for about 40 per cent of the. world's Roman Catholics. Cars. honked their horns as the news spread and television announcers. screamed with elation and surprise and Catholics began flooding toward. the cathedral, where Ana Maria Perez and a few dozen other women had. been waiting for the announcement. ‘He. is going to be the pope of the street,’ she said, referring to. Bergoglio's habit of taking the subways alongside working class. Argentines. Historic: Shelly Guadelupe was visiting New York City from Puerto Rico when the news was announced. Many followers are excited about the pick because he is the first Jesuit to be selected, and made his name by giving back to the needy. Momentous: Ms Guadelupe, from Puerto Rico, took in the fact that the new Pope is the first from Latin America. His people: The new Pope looked out at his following from the balcony of St Peter's Basilica. Known until Wednesday as Jorge. Bergoglio, the 76-year-old is said to be a humble man who denied himself. the luxuries that previous Buenos Aires cardinals enjoyed. New life: Known as Jorge Bergoglio until today, the 76-year-old is thought of as a humble man who denied himself the luxuries. Church-watchers are reading that as a. sign that the upper-echelon of Catholics understand that their global. image may need to be reworked in light of recent scandals- like the. widespread sex abuse cases throughout the United States, for example-. and need to focus on doing good. There was excitement as well elsewhere. Bergoglio. often rode the bus to work, cooked his own meals and regularly visited. the slums that ring Argentina's capital. He considers social outreach,. rather than doctrinal battles, to be the essential business of the. church. In Panama City, public relations executive Nelsa Aponte said with teary eyes, ‘This made me cry, I had to get out my handkerchief.’ ‘We have a new pastor, and for the first time, he is from Latin America.’ Armando Connell, 54, a doorman at a luxury hotel in Panama City, expressed hope that ‘the new pope will be closer to us, and will show more concern about the poverty many of us suffer.’ In Mexico City, pediatrician Victor De la Rosa, 64, said the decision ‘is going to allow Latin America to be more involved in the church's decisions, above all in modernizing the church.’ American politicians were quick with their congratulations, many of them taking to Twitter to announce their praise in 140 characters. Congratulations: President Obama released a lengthy statement through his press office which was then shortened for Twitter. Demographics: As the former Governor of Hispanic-heavy Florida, Jeb Bush brought up Pope Francis' Argentinean upbringing in his Twitter post. All faiths: The goodwill was not limited to Catholics as Jewish Senator Chuck Schumer shared his congratulations. Former Florida Governor, and possible. Republican presidential nominee, Jeb Bush made a point of bringing up. the historic geographic implications of the pick.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:You are given a new situation: Keith is a biotech scientist. He had developed a GMO crop that he labeled as crop A. To see how his GMO crop compare with another crop he selected crop B. Crop B was a non-GMO crop. Keith needed to find the pros and cons of both crops. and a hint : Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... Please answer this question : Would crop A more likely or less likely be virus resistant than crop B? A:","completion":"Considering the given information, it is more likely that crop A, the genetically modified organism (GMO) crop, would be more virus resistant than crop B, the non-GMO crop. The reason for crop A's probable increased virus resistance can be attributed to the genetic engineering techniques used in its development. Genetic engineering allows breeders to introduce specific genes into a crop's genome to enhance certain traits, such as increased durability, nutritional content, insect resistance, virus resistance, and herbicide tolerance. In the case of crop A, one such trait could be virus resistance, achieved by introducing genes that protect the plant from viral infections. The development of crop A might involve the utilization of transgenes from other species or specific gene editing techniques to augment its defense mechanisms against viruses. As a result, crop A is expected to have a better capability to resist viruses compared to crop B, which has not been genetically modified for enhanced virus resistance. However, it is important to note that natural resistance to viruses can still occur in conventional crops like crop B through traditional breeding methods, hybridization or cross-pollination. But these conventional methods usually require more time and effort compared to the precise gene manipulation techniques used in developing GMO crops. It should also be mentioned that there might be potential concerns and debates surrounding the use of GMOs, such as effects on the environment, food safety, and ethical considerations, which might affect the preference and acceptance of crop A or other GMO crops. In summary, based on the genetic engineering techniques used in the development of GMO crops, it is more likely that crop A would exhibit greater virus resistance than crop B, the non-GMO crop."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A young woman, Luda Mae Hewitt, finds the child while searching for food. She takes him back to the Hewitt residence, names him Thomas, and decides to raise him as her own. Thirty years later, Thomas works in the same factory in which his real mother died, working for the same man who left him in the dumpster. He is informed that the plant has been shut down by the health department, but refuses to leave until the boss forces his assistant to make him leave. Later, Tommy returns and brutally murders his boss. Before leaving, Tommy finds a chainsaw. Luda Mae's son, Charlie Hewitt, learns from the town's Sheriff what Tommy has done and accompanies him to arrest him. When they find Tommy, Charlie kills the Sheriff and assumes his identity. He takes his body back home and butchers him for stew meat. He informs the rest of the family that they'll never go hungry again. Two brothers, Eric and Dean, are driving across the country with their girlfriends, Chrissie and Bailey, to enlist in the Vietnam War.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities.

North Korea says South's propaganda broadcasts taking it to 'brink of war' A senior North Korea party official warned of war in a speech on Saturday as South Korea continued blasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda across the border in retaliation for the North’s fourth nuclear test. Related: Bang bang bang! The K-pop songs being blasted into North Korea Speaking to a massive crowd at Pyongyang’s Kim Il-sung Square, a top ruling party official said the broadcasts – along with talks between Washington and Seoul on the possibility of deploying nuclear bombers in the South – have pushed the Korean Peninsula “toward the brink of war”. Pyongyang’s rivals were “jealous” of the North’s claimed successful hydrogen bomb test, Workers’ party secretary Kim Ki Nam said in comments broadcast on state TV late Friday. North Korean propaganda is filled with warnings of war, and the country is sensitive to criticism of its authoritarian leadership, which Seoul resumed in its cross-border broadcasts on Friday for the first time in nearly five months. Pyongyang has previously said the broadcasts were tantamount to an act of war. When South Korea briefly resumed propaganda broadcasts in August after an 11-year break, Seoul said the two Koreas exchanged artillery fire. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported that frontline South Korean troops, near 11 sites around the loudspeakers, were on highest alert. Yonhap said Seoul had deployed missiles, artillery and other weapons systems near the border to swiftly deal with any possible North Korean provocation. South Korea’s defence ministry did not confirm the reports. While the South’s broadcasts also include news and pop music, much of the programming challenges North Korea’s government more directly. “We hope that our fellow Koreans in the North will be able to live in [a] society that doesn’t invade individual lives as soon as possible,” a female presenter said in parts of the broadcast that officials revealed to South Korean media. “Countries run by dictatorships even try to control human instincts.” The broadcasts came as world powers sought to find other ways to punish the North for conducting a nuclear test on Wednesday. US Secretary of State John Kerry urged China, the North’s only major ally and its biggest aid provider, to end “business as usual” with North Korea. Diplomats at a UN security council emergency session pledged to swiftly pursue new sanctions. For current sanctions and any new penalties to work, better cooperation and stronger implementation from China is seen as key. South Korean and US military leaders also have discussed the deployment of US “strategic assets”, Seoul’s defence ministry said. Officials refused to elaborate, but the assets are likely to be B-52 bombers, F-22 stealth fighters and nuclear-powered submarines. After North Korea’s third nuclear test in 2013, the US took the unusual step of sending its most powerful warplanes – B-2 stealth bombers, F-22 stealth fighters and B-52 bombers – to take part in drills with South Korea in a show of force. B-2 and B-52 bombers are capable of delivering nuclear weapons. It may take weeks or longer to confirm or refute the North’s claim that it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, which would mark a major and unanticipated advance for its still-limited nuclear arsenal. Outside experts are skeptical the blast was a hydrogen bomb, but even a test of an atomic bomb would push North Korea closer to building a nuclear warhead small enough to place on a long-range missile. Late Friday, the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety said a small amount of radioactive elements was found in air samples collected from the peninsula’s eastern seas after the blast but the measured amount was too small to determine whether the North had really detonated a nuclear device. The institute said the level of xenon-133 isotopes found in the samples was similar to levels normally detected at its two radioactive gas detectors on the eastern and western coasts. KINS official Lee Ki-hyeong also noted that other types of xenon isotopes used to confirm nuclear explosions weren’t detected. Lee said the institute would continue to collect and analyze more samples. The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, had asked South Korea to refrain from the propaganda broadcasts. But South Korea sees K-pop and propaganda as quick ways to show its displeasure – and a guaranteed irritant to the North’s sensitive and proud leadership. The broadcasts include Korean pop songs, world news and weather forecasts as well as criticism of the North’s nuclear test, its troubled economy and dire human rights conditions, according to Seoul’s defence ministry. Performers on Seoul’s propaganda playlist include a female K-pop band that rose to fame when its members fell multiple times on stage, a middle-aged singer who rose from obscurity in 2015 with a song about living for 100 years and songs by a young female singer, IU, whose sweet voice might be aimed at North Korean soldiers deployed near the border. North Koreans are prohibited from listening to K-pop, but defectors have said their countrymen enjoy music and other elements of South Korea popular culture that are smuggled into the country on USB sticks and DVDs.

Run steam pad over each area for about 30 seconds, move and peel paper (with gloves) (b). Rent a steamer, but use cold water to soften the glue between the wallpaper and the wall. If your wallpaper is vinyl, you will need to score the paper so the team can get behind it. Run wet pad over each area for about 30 seconds, move and peel paper (with gloves)","completion":"The better solution for removing wallpaper out of these two options is: (a). Rent a steamer, it uses boiling water to soften the glue between the wallpaper and the wall. If your wallpaper is vinyl, you will need to score the paper so the team can get behind it. Run steam pad over each area for about 30 seconds, move and peel paper (with gloves). Now, let's go into the details as to why this is the better solution: 1. Use of hot water/steam: The use of hot water or steam in a wallpaper steamer is essential to effectively soften the adhesive substance holding the wallpaper onto the wall. The higher temperature of boiling water or steam helps in breaking down the adhesive more efficiently as compared to cold water. This allows for a quicker and easier removal process with minimal damage to the wall's surface. In contrast, using cold water would not only be less effective in dissolving the adhesive but might also require more time, effort, and potential wall damage. 2. Steamer efficiency: A steamer is specifically designed to generate steam that can easily penetrate and reach the adhesive layer behind the wallpaper. Steamers have a more consistent and powerful distribution of heat compared to other methods like sponges or cloth with hot water. This ensures that sufficient heat is supplied to the adhesive, making the wallpaper easy to remove. 3. Scoring the vinyl wallpaper: As the problem suggests, if the wallpaper is made from vinyl or similar materials, it is essential to score it first in order to allow steam or water to penetrate behind the wallpaper effectively. This can be done using a scoring tool, which creates small perforations in the wallpaper without causing significant damage to the wall beneath. If done carefully and thoroughly, the steamer method in option (a) will help achieve an even, consistent removal process. 4. Safety considerations: While using a steamer with boiling water and steam, it is recommended to wear protective gloves to avoid any accidental burns or injuries. This safety measure is also mentioned in option (a), ensuring that the wallpaper removal process is carried out safely. Therefore, given these points, option (a) offers a more effective, efficient, and safe method for wallpaper removal as compared to the use of cold water in option (b). Using a wallpaper steamer with boiling water and following the appropriate instructions and safety measures will ensure that the process of removing wallpaper is carried out successfully, with minimal damage to the wall and maximum efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I can pay my own school fees .\\" Zhu Yu, a manager of Minsheng Bank, said that they knew lots of students who didn't know how to use their money. So they wanted them to know how to use it carefully. Parents worry that children don't know how to take care of the money by themselves. Shen qiangqiang's mother like the card very much. Shen was asking his mother for a computer for a long time, but his mother didn't buy it for him. She said, \\"We want him to use his card to save money for the computer. If we buy everything he asks for, he will think money comes too easily, and he won't work hard for it.\\" Today, there are many different kinds of bank cards. They are from different banks. People put their money in them. Then they can use their money at any time. People can do many things with bank cards. They can wash cars, go shopping, eat delicious food and travel to other places with the money in their bank cards. The most important thing is not \\"How much did you get?\\" It is necessary for everyone to learn how to save your money and use your money correctly.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"Two men with orange vest leaning over a railing.\\" if \\"A rain cloud taunts picnickers.\\"?","completion":"It would not be accurate to conclude that \\"Two men with orange vest leaning over a railing\\" if \\"A rain cloud taunts picnickers\\" as the two sentences depict unrelated scenarios, and there is no logical connection between them on which to base such a conclusion. The first sentence, \\"A rain cloud taunts picnickers,\\" is describing a situation where a rain cloud is threatening to spoil an outdoor picnic activity. The use of the word \\"taunts\\" personifies the rain cloud, attributing to it intentions of teasing or displeasing the picnickers. This sentence also casually suggests that the picnickers are aware of the potential for rain but might be hoping that it would not occur, which conveys a sense of suspense and unpredictability in the weather conditions. On the other hand, the second phrase, \\"Two men with orange vests leaning over a railing,\\" describes a different and separate scene. The presence of orange vests suggests that the men are wearing safety vests typically associated with construction or maintenance work and might be professionals working in such an environment or carrying out some task that requires them to lean over a railing. This could also imply some potential involvement in inspecting, monitoring, or repairing something. Since the two scenarios mentioned in the given sentences do not share any common elements or circumstances, it is not possible to conclude anything about the men with the orange vests based solely on the information provided about the picnickers and the rain cloud. There is no relevance or relationship between the two sentences, so it is misleading to draw connections between them. To make a logical conclusion based on the given information, there should be some contextual clues or linking factors that tie the two scenarios together. For example, if the two sentences were connected by mentioning that the men in orange vests were also part of the picnic or the rain affected their work, then it would be more reasonable to draw a conclusion. However, in the present case, there are no such connecting factors, rendering it impossible to draw any conclusion regarding the two men with orange vests from the given information about the picnickers and the rain cloud."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Preparations for joining the European Exchange Rate Mechanism II and the Eurozone continue in Bulgaria. The sentence above, translated into English, reveals that Bulgaria is currently undergoing preparations to join two significant European financial systems. Let us break these components down for a better understanding. 1. European Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II): ERM II is an exchange rate mechanism utilized by the European Union (EU) with the primary aim of reducing fluctuations in the exchange rate and ensuring stability within the entire Eurozone. It serves as a preparatory stage to join the Eurozone for countries that seek to adopt the Euro as their official currency. ERM II requires participating countries to maintain a stable exchange rate with the Euro, within an allowed fluctuation range. By joining ERM II, Bulgaria intends to demonstrate its currency's stability and economic preparedness for Eurozone membership. 2. Eurozone: The Eurozone, sometimes referred to as the Euro Area, comprises 19 of the 27 European Union countries that have adopted the Euro as their official currency. It aims to create economic and monetary stability by simplifying trade and transactions among member countries. Joining the Eurozone is a common goal among EU member countries, as it brings additional facilities, cooperation, and benefits to its participants. Bulgaria's preparations to join the Eurozone signal its intention to integrate its economy further into European systems and adopt the Euro as its national currency. This process involves meeting several convergence criteria, such as low inflation rates, stable long-term interest rates, sustainable public finances, and a stable exchange rate with Euro through the ERM II. In summary, Bulgaria is currently making preparations to join both the European Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II) and the Eurozone. This move will demonstrate the nation's commitment to achieving greater economic stability and cooperation with the other European countries and facilitating easier trade within the region. As a result, this endeavor will contribute to not only Bulgaria's economic growth but also to the overall integration and unity within the European Union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The fragrant aroma of the flavored shisha fills the space, creating an atmosphere of relaxation and comfort. Cushions and pillows are scattered across the lush woven rug, reflecting the rich hues of the lanterns that cast soft, warm glows against the walls adorned with various intricate tapestries.

Curiosity piqued, he reaches over and retrieves the notebook, flipping through the pages filled with inked sketches and scribbled thoughts. His interest in one particular passage seems to bring a furrow to his brow as he rereads the lines with an intensified focus. The hookah pipe now forgotten, he sets it down beside him, freeing both of his hands to cradle the notebook.

Article: Often, partners cling when they fear that the person they care about is about to leave. You may subtly be spending less time together, texting or calling less often, or not be sending the same reassurance that you had previously. The fear of abandonment can kick in. While it’s not your role to provide assurance, you can understand the behaviors and motivations behind clinging. If your partner starts to worry about you leaving, remind him or her while neither of you can predict the future, you are both happy now, and now is where the focus is best placed. Sometimes you choose people whom you share a great attraction, yet trigger your deepest insecurities. This can be true of your partner, too. Without you realizing it, you can trigger insecurities in your partner that have never been explored before. Realize that this may mean one person wants to pull closer or wants to pull away. While it’s tempting to run, it can also be worth it to stick with it and work through the issues. Perhaps you’ve had clingy people in your life before (like a younger sibling or an ex) and your current partner’s behavior is triggering those memories, causing you to want to run. Before you go blaming your partner, take a few moments to reflect on your own life. Have there been previous relationships when you’ve clung? What made you cling, and how did the other person respond to your behavior? What is it about the clinginess that upsets you, and how do you respond to it? Do you respond in anger, frustration, or distancing yourself? There’s a distinction between neediness and manipulation. Manipulation often involves you giving up something for the other person. A manipulator may use weaknesses against you, blame you for things, or suggest that only you can help him or her. Especially if you tend to be a genuinely helpful person, be careful not to be taken advantage of by your partner. Ask yourself whether your partner’s actions or needy or if they are manipulative. Manipulation can be punishing you when your partner doesn’t get his or her way (giving the silent treatment, not performing household chores), or as extreme as threatening to hurt the self if you don’t do what he or she wants. If you find yourself feeling punished when you don’t comply with your partner’s demands or neediness, it may be manipulation. If you feel like you are being manipulated, be careful in how you interact with your partner, especially when talking about offering help, money, or giving up something. For more information, check out How to Pick Up on Manipulative Behavior, How to Recognize a Manipulative or Controlling Relationship, and How to Deal With a Manipulative Person. Your partner can't necessarily help he or she feels clingy. Remind yourself of all the things that make your partner great and that make the relationship great. Be patient and empathetic toward your partner for why he or she feels this way. Perhaps your partner has felt abandoned in the past or there are things you don’t fully understand about him or her. When you feel angry or frustrated, remind yourself to be patient, loving, and gentle toward your partner and his or her emotions. If you tend to run away, imagine yourself in a secure, equally balanced relationship. If your partner tends to cling, have him or her imagine the self in an equally balanced relationship. Even imagining a safe, healthy relationship can be helpful, especially when under stress. Set aside some time with your partner for this exercise. Close your eyes and imagine what a healthy relationship looks like to you (and your partner). Imagine feeling calm, centered, and happy at the thought of this relationship. What does it feel like? What do the two of you do together, and not do together? Then, shift your attention and imagine that that is the relationship you have. When you are finished, open your eyes and discuss. Often there’s something about the relationship that’s beneficial to both people and not just one person. So, if you have a partner that you perceive as clingy, is it possible that somehow you benefit from or play into the clinginess? Some signs of codependent relationships include an inability to find happiness outside of one person, staying with someone even though your partner has some unhealthy or destructive behaviors (like drug abuse or alcoholism). Do you find yourself giving to your partner (emotionally, physically, financially) even at the cost of your own health or well-being? Ask yourself if you give up your own needs to fulfill the needs of your partner. This can lead to short-term and long-term consequences. Ask yourself whether you are genuinely happy with your partner or if you stay with him or her based on what you’d lose if you broke up. Remember there will be times that you will be needy and times when your partner will distance from you. This is the normal flow of relationships. When you care about someone, you choose to love and support him or her during the ebbs and flows, even when it influences your life. Remind yourself that circumstances and situations can always change, and that relationships are fluid. Is your partner being clingy because of a situation or life event? If so, you may need to give your partner a momentary break and focus on being supportive. There will be times you will need extra support, too.

Search crews will send a robotic. submarine deep into the Indian Ocean on Monday for the first time to try. to determine whether underwater signals detected by sound-locating. equipment are from the missing Malaysian plane's black boxes, the leader. of the search effort said. The. crew on board the Australian navy's Ocean Shield will launch the. unmanned underwater vehicle Monday evening, said Angus Houston, the head. of a joint agency coordinating the search off Australia's west coast. The Bluefin 21 autonomous sub can create a three-dimensional sonar map. of the area to chart any debris on the seafloor. The. move comes after crews picked up a series of underwater sounds over the. past two weeks that were consistent with an aircraft's black boxes. Scroll down for video. Subs: Rescuers are hoping the Artemis AUV submarine (pictured) will be able to help find the missing plane. Bluefin: The remote subs will search the ocean floor for any sign of the missing plane, which was last heard from more than a month ago. 'We haven't had a single detection in six days, so I guess it's time to go under water,' Houston said. Prime. Minister Tony Abbott raised hopes last week when he said authorities. were 'confident' the four underwater signals that have been detected are. coming from the black boxes on Flight 370, which vanished March 8. during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. But. Houston warned that while the signals are a promising lead, the public. needs to be realistic about the challenges facing search crews, who are. contending with an extremely remote, deep patch of ocean. 'The search area is new to man,' he said. 'I. would caution you against raising hopes that the deployment of the. autonomous underwater vehicle will result in the detection of the. aircraft wreckage - it may not. 'However, this is the. best lead we have, and it must be pursued vigorously. Again, I emphasize. that this will be a slow and painstaking process.' Officials released this map showing areas they plan to search for the missing jetliner. His assessment came after it emerged that Malaysian military investigators believe the missing plane was 'thrown around like a fighter jet' just after it lost contact with the authorities in a bid to dodge radar. Flight MH370 is thought to have climbed to heights of 45,000ft - 10,000ft above its normal altitude - before plummeting to just below 5,000ft. The. plane's two black boxes, which contain flight data and cockpit voice. recordings, have beacons that emit 'pings' so they can be more easily. found, but the beacons' batteries last only about a month, and it has. been more than a month since the plane vanished. The. Australian navy ship Ocean Shield has been dragging a U.S. Navy device. called a towed pinger locator through the water to listen for any sounds. from the beacons. Over the past 10 days, the equipment has picked up. four separate signals. The. Bluefin sub takes six times longer to cover the same area as the ping. locator, and the two devices can't be used at the same time. It will begin searching an area 5km by 8km and will be launched for a second search 24 hours later. Crews were. hoping to detect additional signals before sending down the sub, so they. could triangulate the source and zero in on where exactly the black. boxes may be. Search: A spotter aboard a Royal New Zealand Air Force plane looks for any debris that could be from the missing plane. Pilots: Zaharie Ahmad Shah (left), 53, and Fariq. Abdul Hamid, 27 (right) were in charge of the plane. But it has. been 38 days since the plane disappeared, and search crews haven't. picked up any new sounds since Tuesday, suggesting that the devices' batteries may now be dead. That is why officials will now being using. the Bluefin, Houston said. The. submarine will take 24 hours to complete each mission: two hours to. dive to the bottom, 16 hours to search the seafloor, two hours to return. to the surface, and four hours to download the data, Houston said. In. its first deployment, it will search a 40-square-kilometer. (15-square-mile) section of seafloor. The. black boxes could contain the key to unraveling the mystery of what. happened to Flight 370 after it disappeared with 239 people on board. Investigators believe the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean. based on a flight path calculated from its contacts with a satellite and. analysis of its speed and fuel capacity. But they still don't know why. Meanwhile,. officials were investigating an oil slick not far from the area where. the underwater sounds were detected, Houston said. Crews have collected a. sample of the oil and are sending it back to Australia for analysis, a. process that will take several days. Joint effort: A U.S. Navy P8 Poseidon waits to join the search for the missing Malaysian airliner. The 'pings' were possibly emitted by the Malaysia flight's black box, which puts a strict time limit on the search, as the black box only has about a month of battery power, and has been missing for a month already. Working alongside ships and aircraft from seven other nations, the two Royal Navy vessels face the same race against time to find the black box flight recorder. The. oil does not appear to be from any of the ships in the area, but. Houston cautioned against jumping to any conclusions about its source. A. visual search for debris on the ocean surface was continuing on Monday. over 47,600 square kilometers (18,400 square miles) of ocean about 2,200. kilometers (1,400 miles) northwest of the west coast city of Perth. A. total of 12 planes and 15 ships would join the two searches. But. Houston said that the visual search operation would be ending in the. next two to three days. Officials haven't found a single piece of debris. linked to the plane, and Houston said the chances that any would be. have 'greatly diminished.' 'We've. got no visual objects,' he said. 'The only thing we have left at this. stage is the four transmissions and an oil slick in the same vicinity,. so we will investigate those to their conclusion.' The ship is designed for long stays at sea, and could potentially continue its search for up to 60 days. Also aiding Australian vessel Ocean Shield in the search effort is the U.K nuclear submarine HMS Tireless. Complicating. matters further is the depth of the ocean in the search area. The. seafloor is about 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) below the surface, which is. the deepest the Bluefin can dive. Officials are looking for other. vehicles that could help to retrieve any wreckage, should the Bluefin. find any. Houston's gloomy outlook will be met with mixed emotions by relatives of the mostly Chinese passengers. Some. are still clinging to hope that the aircraft has not plunged into the. Ocean and sunk, but has crashed or landed somewhere on land, giving. those on board a chance of surviving. But other relatives have accepted that their loved ones are lost, but want closure with the discovery of the wreckage and recovery of bodies.

Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities.

Q: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Barend was: [+] handsom kid; [+] boring looking kid; [+] not enough information; [+] smart kid; The answer is:","completion":"[+] boring looking kid"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although actually born in what was then the semi-autonomous region known as The State of Franklin, whom did Fess Parker claim was born on a mountaintop in Tennessee????","completion":"Fess Parker claimed that Davy Crockett was born on a mountaintop in Tennessee. However, it is essential to note that Davy Crockett was actually born in what was then the semi-autonomous region known as the State of Franklin. The State of Franklin was an unrecognized territory located in what is now northeastern Tennessee between 1784 and 1789. The misconception regarding Crockett’s birthplace may have resulted from the popular 1950s TV show \\"Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier,\\" in which Fess Parker portrayed Davy Crockett, referring to him being born on a mountaintop in Tennessee. Davy Crockett, born on August 17, 1786, was an American folk hero, frontiersman, soldier, and politician. He is often referred to as \\"King of the Wild Frontier.\\" His life story has been widely fictionalized, and many legends surround his exploits. Nevertheless, he did have an impressive record of accomplishments. Growing up, he became skilled at hunting and had a deep appreciation for the wilderness. Crockett eventually entered politics and served as a member of the Tennessee State Legislature in the 1820s. He went on to serve three terms in the United States House of Representatives as a representative from Tennessee, where he was known for his strong opposition to President Andrew Jackson and his support of the rights of the settlers against Native American tribes living in the southeastern United States. In 1835, he joined the Texas Revolution, fighting for Texas independence from Mexico. During this rebellion, Crockett, alongside other American volunteers, perished in the legendary Battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836. The state of Tennessee still remembers Crockett as one of its most beloved sons. Fess Parker was a film and television actor who is best known for his portrayal of Davy Crockett in the 1954–1955 Disney miniseries \\"Davy Crockett.\\" The theme song from the show, \\"The Ballad of Davy Crockett,\\" became an instant hit and contributed to Crockett's resurgence in popularity. Parker's performance as Davy Crockett in the series played a significant role in creating the widely believed notion that Crockett was born on a mountaintop in Tennessee, which has been perpetuated through the years. In conclusion, Fess Parker claimed that Davy Crockett was born on a mountaintop in Tennessee; however, his actual birthplace was in the State of Franklin, a semi-autonomous region that existed at the time. The myth surrounding Crockett's birth on a mountaintop can be largely attributed to the popularization of his character in the TV series. Regardless of misconceptions about his birthplace, Davy Crockett remains a symbol of courage, determination, and the American spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: This article: At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo.

You have 6*u minus 9*u. Think of it like this: you have 6 apples and take away 9 apples, you end up with -3 apples. So, 6*u - 9*u becomes -3*u. Now, our equation is: -9 = -3*u Now, let's solve for u. Since we want to find 'u', we want to get rid of the -3 on the right side. To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by -3. When we divide -9 by -3, we get 3 (-9/-3 = 3).

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","completion":"Thanks to Alfred Hitchcock, I've been terrified of birds since the early 1980s when I caught his frightening piece of movie \\"magic\\" on television. Since the scaring incident, I've not... First, it is important to understand why Alfred Hitchcock's film \\"The Birds\\" could have such a profound impact on someone's life. Released in 1963, this classic horror-thriller film, which is based on Daphne du Maurier's short story, manages to evoke a deep sense of fear and terror in its audiences. The film's masterful use of suspense, psychological elements, and visual storytelling combined with its groundbreaking special effects, make it an enduring piece of Hollywood history. The main theme that the film deals with is humanity's fight for survival in the face of a mysterious and terrifying force, in the form of an unexplained and sudden attack by birds. Hitchcock does a masterful job of creating tension throughout the film, as the characters are continually faced with unexpected threats, building a sense of dread in the viewer. It is easy to understand why a young viewer who happened upon this film on television in the early 1980s could be scarred for life. At that time, the audience was saturated with the typical horror genre movies like slasher films which often depended on blood and gore. However, Hitchcock's \\"The Birds\\" stood out as a uniquely terrifying experience, with seemingly innocent animals morphing into lethal and inexplicable predators. One possible reason for developing a fear of birds after such a traumatic experience is that the film plays on our primal fears. Birds, being a common aspect of our daily lives, induce an overwhelming sense of helplessness and terror when they suddenly turn against humans. The unpredictability of the attacks by birds in the film leaves viewers with a feeling of perpetual vulnerability, creating a subconscious, irrational phobia that can persist for a long time. To overcome this fear, it is essential to recognize that the events in the movie are fictional and not a representation of reality. Birds in the real world are typically not harmful and certainly don't have a coordinated vendetta against people. By rationalizing the situation, you can begin to differentiate the movie's plot from your daily life. There are various ways to help overcome a fear of birds that has been ingrained by a movie like \\"The Birds.\\" For instance, gradually exposing oneself to birds in a safe and controlled environment can help break down the subconscious fear that has taken root. Professional help, such as visiting a therapist who specializes in treating phobias, can also be beneficial. Additionally, understanding the techniques that Hitchcock utilized to create such a powerful response in viewers can help neutralize the fear. By dissecting the movie and its impact from a more analytical perspective, you can begin to appreciate the skill behind the storytelling rather than simply reacting to the fear it evokes. Ultimately, overcoming the fear of birds that may have been instigated by watching Alfred Hitchcock's \\"The Birds\\" involves understanding the impact of the film, rationalizing the source of fear, and gradually acclimating oneself to the presence of birds in real life. It may be a slow and challenging process, but with the right approach, it is possible to conquer the fear."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing...","completion":"Derwent Wood assigned the pointing machine assignment to the man who would later use the Chac Mool as a motif (Henry Moore).

Nawaz Ali hails from Lahore in Pakistan and Ranvir Singh Grewal belongs to a village, Jakopur, in Punjab, India. About 20 years ago, both of them migrated to Sydney, Australia, in search of work, where they met and became the best of friends. Gradually, their hard work paid off. Ranvir opened an Indian restaurant, which became a runaway success. Nawaz Ali opened a shop opposite Ranvirâs restaurant. It did well and he could manage to lead a comfortable life but he was not as successful as Ranvir. Nawaz Ali was very grounded in his culture and values and this helped him to remain level-headed and not get carried away by the comforts of life in Australia. He never lost sight of what was morally and ethically right and stood by his Asian values. On the other hand, Ranvir got carried away by his success. He felt that he was superior to the other Indians and Asians who were not as successful. He found merit in all things associated with the white folks â their lifestyle, their values and culture, their behaviour and mannerisms â and looked down upon his Indian upbringing and values. He had no more use for ethics and morality. He became very conscious of his money, status and reputation. The difference in outlook and behaviour drive the two friends apart until they reach a point where Ranvir stops talking to Nawaz.

In both alpha and beta decay, the unstable atom loses particles from its nucleus to decrease instability and achieve a stable state. In the case of alpha decay, the loss of two protons and two neutrons results in the formation of a new element with a mass number reduced by 4 and an atomic number reduced by 2. In beta decay, a neutron changing into a proton and an electron (beta particle) results in an element with an atomic number increased by 1, and the mass number remains unchanged. This process continues until the unstable nucleus goes through successive radioactive decays, converting it into a stable nucleus of a different element or an isotope with a stable nucleon configuration. The sequence of these radioactive decays is called the decay chain, and the final product is a stable isotope, often leading to stable isotopes of lead (in the case of heavy elements)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

As the two rugby giants prepare to collide in Cardiff, Lock Alun Wyn Jones confesses that Wales will be cautious of a new-look French side stepping onto the field. With several changes to the French national squad, the Wales team must stay vigilant to continue their winning streak in the tournament. Step 1: Examine the Welsh perspective Veteran Lock Alun Wyn Jones, who has been an integral part of the Welsh squad for years, has expressed the need for Wales to be careful against a revamped French side. Despite recent successes in the Six Nations, Jones acknowledges the potential threat of a reformed French team, citing their unique playing style and innovative tactics. As a result, Wales will have to maintain discipline, adapt their game plan, and pay attention to details in order to emerge victorious over the talented French side. Step 2: Analyze the French factor With the French team embracing several new faces, there's an inevitable sense of unpredictability in their gameplay. This element of surprise will keep the Welsh side guessing, as France can bring forth new strategies that might not have been seen in previous encounters. Wales will have to rely on their experience, the guidance of their coaching staff, and their ability to read the game on the fly to counter the unknown elements that France may unleash. Step 3: Highlight the importance of the match This round three encounter is a significant battle for both teams, as it may determine their positions moving forward in the Six Nations Championship. For Wales, a win would keep them in the running for top honors, while a loss may derail their title ambitions.

For Wales, captain Alun Wyn Jones will be leading the charge, alongside stars like Leigh Halfpenny and Louis Rees-Zammit.

Ryan, who had one year remaining on his contract, was retained by owner Woody Johnson for next season after his job appeared in jeopardy.

Question: How many in percent from the census weren't African American? Answer:","completion":"To determine the percentage of people who weren't African American from the census data, we need to find the total population and the number of African Americans. Then we will subtract the number of African Americans from the total and divide the result by the total population to get the percentage. Step 1: Find total population Add the number of people from each racial category together: White: 37,460 Asian: 23,058 African American: 4,759 Native American: 426 Pacific Islander: 381 From other races: 2,463 From two or more races: 5,265 Total population: 37,460 + 23,058 + 4,759 + 426 + 381 + 2,463 + 5,265 = 73,812 Step 2: Subtract the number of African Americans from the total population 73,812 (total population) - 4,759 (African American population) = 69,053 Step 3: Divide the result by the total population and multiply by 100 to get the percentage (69,053 / 73,812) * 100 = 93.6 Answer: Approximately 93.6% of the population from the census weren't African American."},{"prompt":"Choose from: A). they will be sad B). quite elated C). be very happy I heard that Lee gave nobody a bonus at christmas time that year.

You must be running version 1.6 or later to access this option. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Only version 1.5 or later will allow you to download earlier versions of minecraft\\"?","completion":"No, the above paragraph states that only \\"version 1.6 or later\\" will allow you to download or load earlier versions of Minecraft, not \\"version 1.5 or later.\\" In other words, the capability to downgrade or to choose to play earlier versions of Minecraft was apparently only implemented from version 1.6 onwards, according to the information given. So, if you are currently using any version below 1.6 (e.g., 1.5), you would need to first upgrade to at least version 1.6 to be able to have the option to load the earlier versions of Minecraft. To clear things up, here's a step-by-step process of how you can downgrade Minecraft if you're already using version 1.6 or later: Step 1: Open the Minecraft Launcher, Step 2: Click ‘Installations’ on the launcher start page, Step 3: Check the box says ‘Historical Versions,’ Step 4: Click ‘New’ to open the versions menu, Step 5: Enter any name for your installation and choose the version you want from the dropdown box labeled ‘Version.’, Step 6: Click ‘Create,’ Step 7: Now, exit the installations screen, back on the start page of the launcher, click the dropdown box next to play, and select the version you just installed, Step 8: Click ‘Play’ to start the game with that version. Following these steps will downgrade your Minecraft to an earlier version, granted you are starting from version 1.6 or later. Always remember to backup your worlds before changing versions to avoid data loss. Minecraft does not support mixing versions with differing world formats, meaning that a world creating in one version might not work with another. If you have made significant progress in a particular world, ensure you have it backed up before moving between versions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - The Territory of Minnesota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 3, 1849, until May 11, 1858, when the eastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Minnesota. - Bloomington is the fourth largest city in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It is located in Hennepin County on the north bank of the Minnesota River, above its confluence with the Mississippi River. Bloomington lies south of downtown Minneapolis. The city's population is 86,435, according to the 2015 United States Census estimates. - The Minnesota Golden Gophers football program represents the University of Minnesota in college football at the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) level. Founded in 1882, the program is one of the oldest in college football. Minnesota has been a member of the Big Ten Conference since its inception in 1896 as the Western Conference. The Golden Gophers claim seven national championships: 1904, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1940, 1941, and 1960. Since 2009, the Gophers have played all their home games at TCF Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In January 2017, the Gophers fired head coach Tracy Claeys and hired former Western Michigan head coach PJ Fleck as the new head coach. - Target Field is a baseball park located in downtown Minneapolis. It is the home ballpark of the Minnesota Twins, the state's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. It is the franchise's sixth ballpark and third in Minnesota. The Twins moved to Target Field for the 2010 Major League Baseball season after 28 seasons at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. It is the first facility built specifically for the Twins since the team moved to the Twin Cities in 1961; Metropolitan Stadium was built for the Minneapolis Millers five years before the franchise's first season in Minnesota, and the Metrodome was built as a multipurpose stadium for the Twins, Minnesota Vikings, and the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers football team. The 2010 season was the first since 1936 in which the franchise (then known as the Washington Senators) did not share their home stadium with an NFL team. The Twins received the certificate of occupancy from Mortenson Construction on December 22, 2009. The Twins staff moved in on January 4, 2010. - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs. - The Minnesota Kicks were a professional soccer team that played at Metropolitan Stadium in the Minneapolis suburbs of Bloomington, Minnesota from 1976 to 1981. The team was a member of the now defunct North American Soccer League. The Minnesota Kicks were established in 1976 and quickly became one of the league's more popular teams, with an average attendance of 23,120 fans per game in 1976. The Kicks won their division four years in a row from 197679. The Kicks drew over 23,000 fans in each season from 197679, with attendance peaking at 32,775 in 1977. - Metropolitan Stadium (often referred to as \\"the Met\\", \\"the Ice Palace\\" when the Minnesota Vikings played, \\"Met Stadium\\", or now \\"the Old Met\\" to distinguish from the Metrodome) was a sports stadium that once stood in Bloomington, Minnesota, just outside Minneapolis. The Minneapolis Millers minor league baseball team played at Met Stadium from 1956 to 1960. The Minnesota Twins and the Minnesota Vikings then played at the \\"Met\\" from 1961 to 1981.

The team was founded in Washington , D.C. in 1901 as one of the eight original teams of the American League , named the Washington Senators or Washington Nationals . Although the Washington team endured long bouts of mediocrity ( immortalized in the 1955 Broadway musical Damn Yankees ) , they had a period of prolonged success in the 1920s and 1930s , led by Baseball Hall of Fame members Bucky Harris , Goose Goslin , Sam Rice , Heinie Manush , Joe Cronin , and above all Walter Johnson . Manager Clark Griffith joined the team in 1912 and became the team 's owner in 1920 . The franchise remained under Griffith family ownership until 1984 . In 1960 , Major League Baseball granted the city of Minneapolis an expansion team . Washington owner Calvin Griffith , Clark 's nephew and adopted son , requested that he be allowed to move his team to Minneapolis and instead give Washington the expansion team . Upon league approval , the team moved to Minnesota after the 1960 season , setting up shop in Metropolitan Stadium , while Washington fielded a brand new \`\` Washington Senators '' ( which later became the Texas Rangers prior to the 1972 season ) .

In the 19th century a different Minneapolis Millers were part of the Western League. The team played first in Athletic Park and later Nicollet Park. The name Minneapolis Millers has been associated with a variety of professional minor league teams. The original Millers date back to 1884 when the Northwestern League was formed. This league failed and the Western League replaced it, absorbing some of the old teams. According to Stew Thornley, this team folded in 1891 due to financial problems. In 1894, another team calling itself the Millers was formed when Ban Johnson and Charles Comiskey revived the Western League in hopes of making it a second major league. The Millers continued to play in the Western League through 1900, when the name was changed to the American League to give it more of a national image. Following the 1900 season, several cities were abandoned for bigger markets in cities recently vacated by the National League, including Minneapolis. Some teams were transferred, as was the case of the Kansas City franchise to become the Washington Nationals (Senators). However, some of the teams were just left out in the dark. It is unclear which of these two paths the Millers took, but most evidence seems to point toward abandonment, not a transfer to Baltimore, especially given that no player for the 1900 Millers played for the 1901 Orioles. - The Minnesota Vikings are an American football team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Vikings joined the National Football League (NFL) as an expansion team in 1960, and first took the field for the 1961 season.

The team has played in four Super Bowl games, but lost each one. The team plays its home games at U.S. Bank Stadium in the Downtown East section of Minneapolis. - The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome (commonly called the Metrodome) was a domed sports stadium located in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. It opened in 1982 as a replacement for Metropolitan Stadium, the former home of the National Football League's (NFL) Minnesota Vikings and Major League Baseball's (MLB) Minnesota Twins, and Memorial Stadium, the former home of the Minnesota Golden Gophers football and baseball teams. - Minnesota (locally ) is a state in the midwestern and northern regions of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation. - Minneapolis is the county seat of Hennepin County, and larger of the Twin Cities, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, containing about 3.5 million residents. As of 2015, Minneapolis is the largest city in the state of Minnesota and 46th-largest in the United States with a population of 410,939. Minneapolis and Saint Paul anchor the second-largest economic center in the Midwest, after Chicago. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \\"Senior Circuit\\"). - A bus (archaically also omnibus, multibus, motorbus, autobus) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers. The most common type of bus is the single-decker rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special licence above and beyond a regular driver's licence. - The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC. - The 2010 Major League Baseball season began Sunday, April 4, when the Boston Red Sox defeated their longtime rivals, the 2009 World Series champion New York Yankees at Fenway Park, 97; the regular season ended on October 3. The 2010 All-Star Game was played on July 13 at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California. The National League ended a 13-game winless streak with a 31 victory. Due to this result, the 2010 World Series began October 27 in the city of the National League Champion, the San Francisco Giants, and ended November 1 when the Giants defeated the American League Champion Texas Rangers in the 2010 World Series, four games to one.

Please answer the following question: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What was the last name of the person who borrowed one of Dylan's big, bulky sweaters? is inside the article: The album cover features a photograph of Dylan with Suze Rotolo. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein at the corner of Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: \\"He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.\\" In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: It is one of those cultural markers that influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility. Most album covers were carefully staged and controlled, to terrific effect on the Blue Note jazz album covers ... and to not-so great-effect on the perfectly posed and clean-cut pop and folk albums. Whoever was responsible for choosing that particular photograph for The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan really had an eye for a new look.

In white pines there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In hard pines, on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: How is white pine's texture?","completion":"White pine's texture is very uniform and easy to work with. This is due to the minimal contrast between different parts of the growth ring, which results in a consistent texture throughout the wood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I can use this background: Communication is any way that animals share information. Many animals live in social groups. For these animals, being able to communicate is essential. Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict. Communication may help animals work together to find food and defend themselves from predators. It also helps them find mates and care for their offspring. In addition, communication helps adult animals teach the next generation learned behaviors. Therefore, communication generally improves the chances of animals surviving and reproducing. Now, I have a new situation: Manny and Dean were two classmates. They had to prepare for a school project so they decided to learn about animals. Manny studied animal communication, while Dean studied animal feeding patterns and nutrition. Answer this question please: Which student learned more about animals working together to find food? A:","completion":"Dean studied animal feeding patterns and nutrition, which may involve aspects of animals working together to find food. This is because studying feeding patterns could potentially encompass investigating how animals collaborate in obtaining food. However, Manny, who studied animal communication, likely delved into various aspects of how animals work together, including obtaining food, as the original background suggests that communication is key for tasks such as finding food. Overall, while both topics would touch on how animals possibly work together, Manny's study focusing on animal communication would likely engage more directly with the concept of animals working together to find food. In conclusion, Manny learned more about animals working together to find food. This is thanks to his focus on communication, which is crucial for cooperation among animals, including efforts to obtain food according to the given background information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who does the deceased's lover look like? ? Dr. Frank Peralta is stabbed to death in his apartment one night. The detective on the case, Lt. Stevenson, quickly finds multiple witnesses putting Peralta's lover, Terry Collins, at the scene. However, when Stevenson finds Terry and questions her, she has an iron-clad alibi with multiple witnesses. It is revealed that Terry has an identical twin sister, Ruth, and the pair share the same job and routinely switch places for their own benefit. Stevenson and the district attorney are unable to prosecute, since the twins refuse to confirm which one of them has the alibi. Unable to accept the \\"perfect crime\\", Lt. Stevenson asks Dr. Scott Elliot for help. Scott is an expert on twin study, and has been routinely encountering the Collins twins at their shared place of work, but does not know which one is which. As a front, Scott asks Terry and Ruth if he can study both of them individually as part of his research. The twins accept, though Ruth is worried that Scott might find out that Terry was at Peralta's apartment the night of the murder. However, Terry is attracted to Scott and insists that they can keep the secret for the sake of seeing him. She also comforts Ruth, reminding her that she was only at Peralta's apartment but didn't kill him. From Scott's psychological tests and by spending time with them, he discovers that Ruth is kind and loving, while Terry is highly intelligent, insane, and has been manipulating Ruth almost their entire lives. Terry is jealous that people keep preferring Ruth over her, and is again enraged when Scott falls in love with Ruth instead of her. Terry starts methodically gaslighting Ruth, making her believe that she's hallucinating and going insane, in the hopes of pushing her to suicide.

Natural Resources Police said Cody Iorns, 25, of Washington D.C. was pronounced dead at Anne Arundel Medical Center after attempts to resuscitate him failed. Spokeswoman Candy Thomson said Iorns was part of a group of four paddle boarders who were on the water off Tolly Point around 6:30 p.m. One of the people in the group saw Iorns face down in the water behind them and they attempted to rescue him and bring him to shore, Thomson said. At a press conference Thursday afternoon, Maryland Natural Resources Police Capt. Brian Rathgeb said Iorns suffered undetermined medical distress while on the water. An autopsy is being conducted Thursday in Baltimore to determine the cause of death. Rathgeb said Iorns was wearing an inflatable life jacket, but the device did not inflate. He had three people with him — they started performing CPR, according to Thomson. One went ashore seeking help, Rathgeb said. An Anne Arundel County Fire Department boat picked Iorns up from the water. He was taken to Anne Arundel Medical Center where he was pronounced dead, he said. Iorns was a double amputee and Army veteran who was well-known in the paddle boarding community. He paddle boarded with the help of prosthetic limbs. Capital SUP, a paddle boarding group and business in Annapolis, said in a statement on Facebook that Iorns “went out for a downwind paddle with fellow Capital SUP paddlers and unexpectedly drowned.” “We are still processing how it happened,” the group wrote. “We are at a loss for words. He was our brother. He was an inspiration to everyone on and off the water.” Iorns was profiled by National Geographic last year, which described him as a competitive paddle boarder who’d lost his arms in a motorcycle accident. In the piece, the publication said he was a former Army medic who trained and competed with Capital SUP’s “Water Warriors” program for veterans. In an interview, Iorns described the challenges of paddle boarding while being an amputee, saying “whenever I paddle board, it’s a team sport because someone is getting my board, someone’s helping me with my arms, so that’s my team.” “80 percent of my goal is accomplished by making it to the race,” he said. It was one of three separate incidents that happened out on the Chesapeake Bay during choppy conditions Wednesday afternoon, and brings the number of boating-related deaths this year to 10. By this time last year there had been four boating-related deaths, Rathgeb said. The state saw nine, boating-related deaths in 2017. “We’re on pace for one of the deadliest years boating-wise in Maryland,” he said. Emergency crews are continuing their search today for a missing boater who fell overboard off of a 40-foot cabin cruiser between Kent Narrows and Herrington Harbor South. Thomson said Kevin Yates Sr., 41, of Queen Anne’s County, was helping another boater who’d recently purchased a boat in Kent Narrows to move it over to Herrington Harbor South around 2:45 p.m. Wednesday. Yates was helping the other man to move the boat to Herrington Harbor South while wind gusts were up to 25 knots as he was a more experienced boater, Thomson said. At one point, Yates needed to use the bathroom and handed the helm over to the other boater, Thomson said. It is believed that Yates fell off the vessel sometime during this period, as Thomson said the other boater stayed at the helm for about an hour, uncomfortable leaving it unmanned. “We have a very very large search area,” Rathgeb said at the press conference. “We’re basically searching between Poplar Island and Herring Bay, so Eastern Shore to the Western Shore.” He was last seen wearing blue shorts and a dark shirt with no life jacket. They are continuing to search with aviation units and boats Thursday, Rathgeb said. In another incident, a 6-year-old boy who stepped off a crabbing pier at Sandy Point State Park is expected to survive. The water level was almost flush with the pier when the child stepped off, Rathgeb said. Thomson said that he was with his family having a picnic at the park and went to the crabbing pier where he was swept into the water during particularly rough conditions. The boy’s father jumped into the water after him and brought him back to shore, Thomson said. The boy was taken to Johns Hopkins with non-life threatening injuries and is okay now, Rathgeb said. Of the 10 boating-related deaths in Maryland so far this year, four have occurred in Anne Arundel County. A common theme for almost all the fatalities is that the person wasn’t wearing a life jacket, Rathgeb said. Inflatable life jackets also work, and are worn by Natural Resources Police officers. The inflatable jackets are less bulky, making people more likely to wear them, he said. In Iorns’ case the device wasn’t working properly, he said. “They’re great as long as you maintain them and keep up with them,” he said.

Lynchard /Department of Defense Marvin D. Lynchard /Department of Defense Cody Iorns was not one to lie down in defeat. The Army medic veteran lost his arms following a motorcycle accident in 2015, but fitted with prosthetic limbs, he turned to the water, specifically standup paddleboarding. The dogged athlete was featured in several news reports, showcasing his rise from adversity, and he became well known in the local water sports community. Iorns died Wednesday evening after venturing out into the Chesapeake Bay from Annapolis, MD, according to Maryland Natural Resources Police Public Information Officer Candy Thomson. He was 25. Maryland's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner told NPR the cause was accidental drowning. Iorns set off around 6 p.m. Wednesday with three other paddlers, Thomson said. The plan was to launch from Thomas Point and head toward Spa Creek about five miles away, returning to land about an hour-and-a-half later. As a precaution, somebody in the group sent Maryland Natural Resources Police a message with their route, Thomson said. But the conditions were rocky. \\"We had a huge high tide because of the full moon,\\" Thomson said, \\"we had four to five foot waves.\\" Winds were gusting up to 25 miles per hour, and somehow Iorns wound up behind the group and in the water. \\"They all of a sudden looked back and noticed that Cody had fallen from his paddle board and was face down in the water,\\" Thomson said. His life jacket did not inflate, Thomson said, and the other paddlers were quick to act. \\"They pulled him back on his board and did CPR while pulling him back toward shore,\\" Thomson said. Iorns was brought to the Anne Arundel Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Despite the rough conditions, the paddlers \\"did everything within reason,\\" Thomson said. \\"These were experienced paddlers,\\" Thomson said, especially Iorns. \\"He was in good shape, he was comfortable around the water, he was well known in our paddleboard community.\\" Capital SUP Annapolis, a paddleboard company, posted a message to Facebook saying Iorns \\"unexpectedly drowned\\" after going out with his fellow Capital SUP paddlers. \\"We are still processing how it happened,\\" the post said. \\"Please pray for Cody's family. We are at a loss for words. He was our brother. He was an inspiration to everyone on and off the water.\\" Last year, Iorns spoke to WJLA TV News about the motorcycle accident that changed his life. \\"My left arm was just gone,\\" Iorns said. His right arm was severely fractured and following an infection he lost it too. Iorns, a former Army specialist who served as a combat medic, told WJLA, the easy thing to do would have been to lie in bed. \\"You've got to step out of your comfort zone,\\" he said. \\"I know that I feel so much better when I'm out, trying to give something my 100%,\\" Iorns told National Geographic Adventure, which showcased him in a paddleboarding race last year. National Geographic said Iorns was the only adaptive paddler in the 9-mile long Wrightsville, N.C., Surf to Sound race. He finished 28th. \\"80 percent of my goal is accomplished by making it to the race,\\" he said. \\"So doing the race, that's kind of like the icing on the cake.\\" \\"Standup paddleboarding has been a lot of failing, a lot of working, a lot of finding out what doesn't work the hard way,\\" he said. Still, he said it was the thing he wanted to do most. An investigation into what happened on the water Wednesday evening is ongoing, Thomson said. \\"They were playing by the rules and something happened and that hits you hard because it is so unfair,\\" Thomson said. ||||| Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.

Head teacher Don Smith said, \\"one of the big problems for us at the school has been the number of girls who have been wearing improperly short skirts. This has been an area of special concern at a time when there have been a lot of wrong ideas of being beautiful.\\" Mr Smith said it would be impossible to determine how long girls' skirts should be and that _ would be easier for teachers to carry out.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? what's the highest score on the sats?","completion":"The SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. It is designed to measure reading, writing, and mathematics skills, and assess the critical thinking abilities of the test-takers. The SAT has undergone several changes over the years, including changes to the scoring scale. Before discussing the highest score possible on the SAT in its current format, it's essential to provide a brief overview of its scoring history. Prior to 2005, the SAT only had two sections - Math and Verbal (later renamed Critical Reading) - each scored on a scale of 200 to 800, making the highest possible composite score 1600. In 2005, the SAT was restructured, and a Writing section was added, also scored on a scale of 200 to 800. This change brought the highest possible composite score to a 2400. In 2016, the College Board announced significant changes to the SAT and reverted to the 1600-point scale by combining the Critical Reading and Writing sections into a single section called Evidence-Based Reading and Writing, which is scored out of 800 points. This change left students with two sections: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing, and Math, each scored on a 200-to-800 scale. With these changes, the highest possible composite score on the current SAT is 1600. Thus, a perfect score on the SAT, as of its current format (2021), would be a 1600 – comprising a perfect score of 800 in both the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math sections. In addition to each section's score, the SAT also provides subscores and cross-test scores for different domains such as analysis in history, social studies, and science. However, these subscores and cross-test scores do not contribute to the overall composite score of 1600. It's important to note that achieving a perfect score on the SAT is an extremely rare occurrence. According to the College Board data, only a small fraction of test-takers achieve a perfect score each year. Scoring above 1400 is generally considered an impressive accomplishment, while scoring above 1200 is considered competitive and reflective of a reasonably strong academic profile. However, it is essential to remember that college admissions decisions are primarily based on a variety of factors, not solely on standardized test scores. High school transcripts, extracurricular activities, recommendation letters, and personal essays are among the factors that contribute to an applicant's college admission decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering. Question: \\"Who were on opposite sides of the idea to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center?\\" Answer: \\"The Treasury\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Well, little buddy, some people in the U.S. government wanted to create a special group called an \\"all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center\\" to help find out where bad guys like al Qaeda were getting their money. Mr. Clarke, who worked for something called the NSC, really liked this idea and wanted the Treasury to help set it up. But the Treasury and another group called the CIA didn't want to put their time and resources into making it happen.

What is the final step of the following process: - Human beings burn fossil fuels (oil, gas, etc.) - Carbon dioxide from the burning fossil fuels enter the atmosphere - The make-up of the atmosphere changes - Some energy from the sun cannot escape back through the changed atmosphere - The earth begins to heat because of the extra trapped energy - Human beings cut down trees - Human beings do not re-plant the trees - Trees cannot help take the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - The extra trapped energy starts to change the earth&#x27;s short term weather A:","completion":"The final step of the aforementioned process is the alteration of the Earth's climate system, leading to long-term irreversible consequences for ecosystems, economies, and communities. This phenomenon is known as anthropogenic climate change, or more commonly, global warming. The build-up of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere traps heat, causing an overall warming effect. This effect is further exacerbated by deforestation, as humans cut down trees but do not replace them, leading to fewer trees available to absorb the excess carbon dioxide. The short-term changes in weather caused by the excess trapped energy gradually become more persistent and widespread, resulting in significant shifts in climate patterns. As the Earth's climate continues to change, several consequences emerge, including: 1. Rising global temperatures: The average surface temperature of the Earth increases, causing more frequent and severe heatwaves. This can have detrimental impacts on agriculture, human health, and the survival of various plant and animal species. 2. Melting polar ice caps and glaciers: As temperatures rise, ice caps and glaciers start to melt, contributing to rising sea levels. This poses a significant threat to low-lying coastal regions, which can experience flooding, coastal erosion, and damage to infrastructure. 3. Ocean acidification: As the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, more of it gets absorbed by the ocean, resulting in a decrease in the water's pH level. This acidity can disrupt the ability of marine life, such as shellfish and coral reefs, to build and maintain their shells or skeletons, leading to a decline in these essential ecosystems. 4. Changes in precipitation patterns: Altered atmospheric conditions due to climate change can lead to changes in precipitation levels and distribution, with some regions experiencing more droughts or floods. This can affect water availability, agriculture, and ecosystems in different parts of the world. 5. More extreme weather events: Instances of hurricanes, typhoons, storms, and other extreme weather events may potentially increase in frequency and intensity due to the warming of the Earth. This can result in more significant damage to human settlements, infrastructure, and the environment. 6. Extinction of species and loss of biodiversity: As the Earth's ecosystems undergo rapid shifts due to climate change, many plant and animal species struggle to adapt and may face extinction. This loss of biodiversity can have cascading effects on the environment, leading to further imbalance and damage. 7. Adverse impacts on human health, economy, and society: Climate change can have dire consequences on human health, with heatwaves, floods, droughts, and other extreme events causing death, injury, and disease. Additionally, these changes can disrupt economies, challenge agricultural systems, and increase the possibility of political and social conflicts due to resource scarcity and forced migration. In conclusion, the final step of the process that begins with burning fossil fuels and deforestation is the pervasive and profound alteration of the Earth's climate. This leads to long-term consequences for the planet's ecosystems, economies, and communities, often exacerbating existing challenges and necessitating urgent adaptation and mitigation measures."},{"prompt":"Big Maria Mountains - The Big Maria Mountains are located in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of California near the Colorado River and Arizona.

Q:Information: - Ann Hart Coulter (born December 8, 1961) is an American conservative social and political commentator, writer, syndicated columnist, and lawyer. She frequently appears on television, radio, and as a speaker at public and private events. - Roger Joseph Ebert (June 18, 1942 April 4, 2013) was an American film critic and historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author. He was a film critic for the \\"Chicago Sun-Times\\" from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. - Structural engineering is mainly a sub-division of civil engineering where structural engineers are trained to understand, predict, and calculate the stability, strength and rigidity of built structures for buildings and non-building structures, to develop designs and integrate their design with that of other designers, and to supervise construction of projects on site. They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles etc. where structural integrity affects functioning and safety. - An arch is a curved structure that spans a space and may or may not support weight above it. Arch may be synonymous with vault, but a vault may be distinguished as a continuous arch forming a roof. Arches appeared as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture, and their systematic use started with the Ancient Romans who were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures. - News of the Weird is a syndicated newspaper column edited by Chuck Shepherd that collects bizarre news stories. It was created in 1988. , it is syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate and published in more than 250 newspapers in the United States and Canada. As of July 2008, the daily internet column has merged with two other \\"weird\\" websites to form Weird Universe. - Earthquake engineering is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with earthquakes in mind. Its overall goal is to make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake engineering is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance. - In the United States, same-sex marriage has been legal in all states, Washington, D.C., as well as all U.S. territories except American Samoa, but not on Indian lands, since June 26, 2015, when the United States Supreme Court ruled in \\"Obergefell v. Hodges\\" that state-level bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional. The court ruled that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples and the refusal to recognize those marriages performed in other jurisdictions violates the Due Process and the Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The ruling overturned a precedent, \\"Baker v. Nelson\\". - Compression members are structural elements that are pushed together or carry a load, more technically they are subjected only to axial compressive forces. That is, the loads are applied on the longitudinal axis through the centroid of the member cross section, and the load over the cross sectional area gives the stress on the compressed member. In buildings posts and columns are almost always compression members as are the \\"top chord\\" of trusses. - Uclick LLC was an American corporation (a division of Andrews McMeel Universal) selling \\"digital entertainment content\\" for the desktop, the web and mobile phones.

In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support (the \\"shaft\\" of the column) with a capital and a \\"base\\" or pedestal and made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other compression members are often termed \\"columns\\" because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, \\"column\\" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are \\"engaged\\", that is to say form part of a wall. - Architecture (Latin \\"architectura\\", from the Greek \\"arkhitekton\\" \\"architect\\", from - \\"chief\\" and \\"builder\\") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements. - The National Organization for Marriage (NOM) is an American non-profit political organization established in 2007 to work against the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States.

Everyone's hard at work, with only the clangs of the sharp knives of the meat slicers to break up the monotony. It is a scene straight out of a futuristic film: dozens of men, in pristine white lab coats and hats, on a production line, hacking away at massive chunks of raw meat hanging in front of them. Some of the workers here have been on this factory floor for close to two decades - fathers and sons, generations of families who have worked here. The factory has become an integral part of this town's life. For Scott Grossman, it's more than just a job. It's a lifeline. He's a slicer on the factory floor, and spent 14 years of his life here. But three years ago he left this job for an oil rig. When oil prices were high, his salary doubled. But just before Christmas he lost that job because oil prices crashed, and now he's back. \\"I was made redundant because of the downturn,\\" Scott told me in between slicing of parts of beef. \\"It came as a shock actually. We all knew that resources were slowing down, but I thought I would be safe. No one is safe.\\" When Scott returned to Oakey exports, he noticed a dramatic difference in the direction of the company's business. \\"It's a lot faster in the boning room to what it was when I left. Everyone has higher production targets now,\\" he said. \\"From what I've seen we seem to be doing a lot less domestic and a lot more export.\\" Asian demand That's the picture across the country. Asia has become a major buyer of Australian agricultural products. Australia sold a record 600m of beef to China in 2015, and that growth shows no signs of slowing, with China's appetite for beef expected to soar to 2.2 million tonnes by 2025. The push into agriculture couldn't come soon enough. Recent reports forecast a worrying economic future for Australia, despite it having had 25 years of consecutive growth. The Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) says Australia is facing hazards it hasn't seen in its economy in more than 20 years. The end of the mining boom, and a dependence on China are both reasons why Australia is suffering, which is why the government is so keen to keep agricultural exports to Asia growing. \\"I think the growing middle classes in Asia are here to stay, and I think those opportunities are real,\\" said Josh Frydenberg, Australia's minister for resources, energy and Northern Australia. \\"We have seen the opportunity from the middle class in Asia. Some 3 billion people in the coming decades will be in the Asian middle classes. \\"Rapid rates of urbanisation and continued population growth will lead to a demand for all sorts of services ranging from medical, to education, to high quality agricultural products, and high calorie products like beef. It's an opportunity for Australian exporters.\\" But Australia's agricultural exports are only worth a third of what coal and iron bring to the economy. Even if Australia tried to be the food bowl of Asia, it only produces food enough to feed its own country and another 80 million people. That's not enough to feed neighbouring Indonesia, let alone the whole of Asia. Australian producers say though that they're not trying to satisfy the entire region's needs - it's just the 1% or 2% at the top who they want to sell their premium products to. Anne Story is the woman in charge at Story Fresh Farms in Toowoomba. She is hoping that the rise of the upper middle classes in Asia will keep her business growing. \\"As a producer from an Australian perspective, our limitation has been that we have a small population,\\" she told me as we walked around her lettuce fields. \\"We have a lot of producers but a small market. Even if Asia slows down, there are still so many people who can select what they want to buy, who are able to pay for it now because they're in the right socio-economic class. So even though they're retracting, it's still a massive market from a business perspective.\\" That may be far too optimistic a view, given that Australia's been burned before by hitching its fortunes to Asia, and in particular to China.

The country has seen a significant increase in agricultural exports to Asia, selling a record 600 million of beef to China in 2015, and this growth is expected to continue. The Australian government aims to capitalize on the growing middle class in Asia, including their increasing demand for high-quality agricultural products. However, Australia's agricultural exports are worth only a third of what coal and iron bring to the economy, and some are concerned that relying on Asian markets may prove to be too optimistic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

New Orleans would get off to a fast start in the first quarter as quarterback Drew Brees completed a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marques Colston and a 39-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Meachem. The Lions would answer with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 47-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Detroit came closer as running back Kevin Smith got a 4-yard touchdown run. The Saints would reply with Brees completing a 1-yard and a 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey. The Lions tried to catch up in the third quarter as quarterback Matthew Stafford got a 1-yard touchdown run, yet New Orleans answered with kicker John Carney making a 39-yard field goal. Detroit would respond with Hanson nailing a 24-yard field goal, while the Saints kept pounding away as Brees completed a 58-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Devery Henderson. The Lions would close out the period with safety Louis Delmas returning a fumble 65 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, New Orleans closed out the game as Brees completed a 13-yard touchdown pass to fullback Heath Evans. With the win, not only did the Saints begin their season at 1-0, but Brees (26-of-34, 358 yards, 6 TDs, 1 INT) became the very first quarterback to throw 6 TD passes in an opening day game, as well as tying Billy Kilmer's franchise record for touchdown passes in a game. Question: How many total yards did Drew Brees throw for touchdowns in the second half? Answer:","completion":"In the second half, Drew Brees threw two touchdown passes: one was a 58-yard pass to Devery Henderson, and the other was a 13-yard pass to Heath Evans. To know the total yards he threw for touchdowns, you just need to add these two numbers. So, 58 yards (for Devery Henderson's touchdown) + 13 yards (for Heath Evans' touchdown) = 71 yards.

U.S. President Donald Trump is sending a 4.4 trillion budget request to Congress that includes money for a southern border wall and building up the military, but is projected to increase the federal deficit by more than 1 trillion. White House officials all but acknowledged the proposal unveiled Monday has little chance of becoming law — Congress alone controls federal government spending. But the White House insisted the budget proposal still sends an important message about Trump's priorities. \\"This is a messaging document,\\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters at a briefing Monday. The Trump budget calls for major cuts to domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. But the plan would still not balance the federal budget, in part because of reduced federal revenue due to tax cuts passed last year. Democrats widely rejected the plan. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the proposal a \\"brutal collection of broken promises and staggering cuts.\\" The proposal's failure to eliminate debt is also likely to upset some Republicans, who have traditionally opposed budget deficits. \\"It's simply adjusting to the Washington, D.C., we live in,\\" Mulvaney said, stressing that the new budget plan would help \\"turn the tide\\" on national debt. The White House proposal builds on the massive, two-year spending bill passed last week by Congress and signed by the president. That bill includes a major boost for the military, as well as domestic programs. Mulvaney, a former lawmaker and long-time opponent of federal debt, has acknowledged he likely would not have supported the bill were he still in Congress. But he said the new White House proposal does not mean that all of the money approved by Congress must be spent. \\"These are spending caps, these are not spending floors,\\" he said.

Answer the following question: Jordan persuaded the citizens to vote. They wanted to serve in the city council. Given the context: What will Jordan want to do next? Possible answers: wanted to have power, wanted to have influence, convince others Answer:","completion":"Given the context provided, it seems that Jordan's primary goal was to encourage the citizens to actively participate in democratic processes, such as voting and serving in the city council. Jordan's actions demonstrate a dedication to fostering an engaged and responsible civic community. Consequently, Jordan will likely want to continue their efforts to inspire citizens' involvement in civic initiatives, rather than simply seeking power or influence for themselves. As a result, Jordan's next steps may involve several different approaches to cementing a well-informed and active community. These actions could include: 1. Organizing community forums and town hall events: By facilitating open and inclusive conversations about key issues facing the city, Jordan could help build trust and understanding among citizens, as well as provide opportunities for the council to take direct feedback from the community in their decision-making processes. 2. Working collaboratively with local organizations and interest groups: Jordan could reach out to partner with existing nonprofits, community-service organizations, business associations, and advocacy groups. These partnerships would not only amplify the reach and impact of their initiatives, but also provide diverse perspectives and resources to inform policy decisions accurately. 3. Encouraging transparency and accessibility in city government: One major factor in civic engagement is how accessible the government is to the general public. Jordan could work to improve transparency, making it easier for citizens to understand how the council operates, access crucial information about city policies, and engage effectively with their elected representatives. 4. Developing civic education and leadership programs: To ensure that citizens are informed about their rights and responsibilities, Jordan could work on creating or supporting civic education programs for various age groups. This would help the community understand the importance of participating in the political process, as well as provide them with the knowledge and tools needed to become effective local leaders themselves. 5. Strengthening voter turnout and election process: Jordan may decide to take further steps to ensure that every citizen has a chance to vote and make their voice heard, like advocating for expanded voting hours or easier access to polls. They might also seek ways to modernize and secure the voting process, guarding against any potential vulnerabilities that could undermine the voters' confidence in the democratic process. In summary, Jordan's next steps will likely involve a continuation of their dedication to civic engagement. By empowering citizens to be active participants in local government, Jordan aims to create a robust and responsive city council that accurately represents the interests and needs of the community. This approach goes beyond simply seeking personal power or influence; it demonstrates a genuine commitment to working together to help create a more vibrant and resilient city for everyone."},{"prompt":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

What is the full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia? Answer the above question based on the context below: Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).The title of Symphony No. 3, Sinfonia Espansiva (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \\"outward growth of the mind's scope\\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, The Inextinguishable (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \\"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\\".Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony...","completion":"The full name of the symphony that caused a sensation when conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia, is Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: less effect. If the water does not come into contact with the air, the formation of carbonic acid will be significantly reduced. This is because the air contains carbon dioxide, which is necessary to form carbonic acid when combined with water. With less carbonic acid formation, the iron will not dissolve as much, slowing down the rusting process. Furthermore, with less exposure to air, the water will be less likely to break down into hydrogen and oxygen. The breakdown of water into these elements usually occurs through a process called electrolysis or through direct interaction with atmospheric oxygen.

The girls drop a pair of panties out the window, and if her boyfriend finds them, he'll be rewarded.

She is forced to view videotapes containing images of the victims who were tortured previous to her captivity, as well as videotaped interviews she had given to the media in the past. Realizing there is no way out, Jennifer pleads and screams to anyone who might hear her. During her confinement, she is subjected to various forms of psychological torture. Jennifer eventually finds she is not alone. A young man, Gary (Daniel Gillies), is being held captive in an adjoining cell. The two make contact and try to find out why they are being held. After watching the horrific scene, they find their way out. They both make it to a garage where they find a car. As soon as they are about to start it, a gas erupts in the car making them both unconscious. They find themselves back in their cells where Jennifer sees a tape of Gary being taken and tied to a chair with a gun held under his chin. After a while of Jennifer worrying, she sees Gary being thrown into his cell. She rushes to him and helps him. After having consensual sex, Gary awakens to find Jennifer, who has been drugged once again. He takes out a key to an adjoining cell. After Gary awakens he discovers Jennifer had drunk a bottle of water that had a drug in it to put her to sleep. He then gets up to wipe the blood off his nose, while he's leaving he makes sure Jennifer is sound asleep before leaving the cell. Gary's key opens a...

Ensinnäkin elintarviketarpeiden täyttäminen voidaan saavuttaa kehittämällä kalastus-ja vesiviljelyaloja vastuullisesti ja innovatiivisesti. Tämä voi sisältää parannettujen kalastusvälineiden käyttöä, uusien kalalajien viljelyä ja vaihtoehtoisten kalanrehun lähteiden hyödyntämistä. Näillä keinoilla voidaan vähentää luonnonvarojen käyttöä, vähentää saaliin heittoa ja parantaa kalanjalostuksen tehokkuutta. Toiseksi kalastusteollisuuden ja kalastusyhteisöjen turvaaminen voidaan taata säilyttämällä kalakannat kohtuullisella tasolla ja ylläpitämällä tervettä meriympäristöä.

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

Information: - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia . It contains two species , which both are critically endangered : Huso dauricus ( Georgi , 1775 ) ( kaluga ) Huso huso ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) ( beluga ) Recent data indicate a polyphyletic origin of the genus Huso , and it is suggested that the two Huso species should be included in the genus Acipenser .

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The subject entity with the relation of 'parent taxon' is the genus \\"Huso\\" and the object entity is the family \\"Acipenseridae\\".

SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years. Whether such a deal can be done, Trump declared on Saturday, is something he will know almost... Question: What is probably true about the outcome of the summit? === The answer to the above question is pick from the following.

Given the question: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. After the article, what will sportspeople probably consume? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Only protein supplements so they can eat whatever they want - not enough information - More foods that are higher in protein - They'll consume less protein and more carbs for energy The answer is:","completion":"More foods that are higher in protein"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is threatened when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected. Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi) that Kahane is at a theater in Pasadena. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and accidentally drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water, then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery. The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this.

Process: - Grass and small plants grow in an area - These plants die - The soil gains organic material - The soil becomes more fertile - Larger plants are able to be supported - Trees eventually grow. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more fertile soil happens, how will it affect MORE forest formation. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has both direct and indirect effects on the process of forest formation. Step-by-step explanation: 1. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more fertile soil is available in an area, it will accelerate forest formation. 2. Fertile soil provides more nutrients, which directly support the growth of grass, small plants, and eventually larger plants and trees. This accelerates the early stages of forest formation. 3. As more fertile soil is present, a larger amount of organic material from dead plants will accumulate in the soil, further increasing its fertility (indirect effect). 4. With higher fertility in the soil, the carrying capacity of the area increases, allowing for a greater number of plant species and individual plants to coexist and thrive. This leads to increased competition for resources like sunlight, water, and nutrients, which in turn results in the growth of taller and more robust plants, including trees (direct effect). 5. As trees begin to grow in the area, their roots help stabilize the soil, preventing erosion and further maintaining fertility in the ecosystem (indirect effect). 6. Over time, as more trees and plants are established in the area, a fully-formed forest emerges, supported by the fertile soil provided by the perturbation. In conclusion, the perturbation of more fertile soil has both direct and indirect effects on the process of forest formation. The direct effects include an accelerated growth rate of plant species, while indirect effects include a preservation of soil fertility through root systems and organic material decomposition. Both of these factors contribute to a faster and more successful forest formation process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505.

News article: Cornell drops Brown, becomes first team to clinch NCAA tourney berth PROVIDENCE (AP)  Cornell is back in the NCAA tournament for the third straight year. This time, the brainy bunch plans to hang around for a while. \\"We want to win. We want to advance,\\" coach Steve Donahue said. \\"I think we have the talent to do that.\\" The Big Red became the first team this season to earn an NCAA bid, clinching its third consecutive Ivy League championship by beating Brown 95-76 on Friday night with a record-tying display of three-point shooting. Cornell (26-4, 12-1) made 20 of 30 attempts from three-point range and held Brown to 30% shooting in the second half while cruising to their 24th victory in 26 games. Cornell matched an Ivy League record for 3s in a game and increased its season total to 292, also a conference mark. In doing so, the Big Red wrapped up their fourth Ivy League title — securing the fifth NCAA tournament berth in school history. But they're still looking for their first win in the NCAAs. Cornell has lost in the first round as a No. 14 seed in each of the last two seasons. The Big Red aspire for a stronger showing this year after setting a school record for wins and nearly upsetting then-No. 1 Kansas on the road Jan. 6. \\"We know what to expect going into this tournament,\\" said Ryan Wittman, the school's career scoring leader. \\"But experience alone isn't going to allow us to advance.\\" Donahue said this squad has shown it can compete with the top teams in the country in a way none of his clubs has before. This year's team, he said, is Cornell's deepest and most talented yet. \\"I'm going to try for the rest of my coaching career to get a group like this, and I may never get there,\\" he said. \\"I'm pretty sure I won't.\\" The Big Red will have a chance to tie the conference record for wins in their final game of the regular season Saturday at Yale. Jon Jacques led Cornell with 20 points and seven rebounds. Louis Dale (FSY) added 18 points and eight assists, and Wittman had 16 points, seven rebounds and five assists. All five Big Red starters scored in double figures. \\"Everyone was on at the same time,\\" Wittman said. \\"We just got in a rhythm offensively tonight, and it started going down for us.\\" Peter Sullivan had 23 points on 8-of-13 shooting to lead the Bears (11-19, 5-8). Cornell led 51-47 at halftime, establishing its three-point shooting early in a frenetic first half. The Big Red made 11 of their first 13 attempts from beyond the arc, including eight in a row at one point. \\"We have to practice 3s more than any team in the country,\\" said Jacques, who shot 6 of 8 from three-point range. \\"Practice makes perfect.\\" But Brown found success on the offensive end as well, shooting 59% from the field in the first half to keep the game close. Cornell started the second half on a 14-4 run, however, and Brown never got within single digits again. You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Write the answer: This summer, Arsenal signed Santi Cazorla for £16 million from which Spanish football club?","completion":"Santi Cazorla, a renowned Spanish professional footballer, made a move to Arsenal FC in the summer of 2012. Prior to this move, Cazorla was associated with the Spanish football club, Málaga CF. Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez, commonly known as Santi Cazorla, was born on December 13, 1984, in Llanera, Spain. He started his football career with VillaReal CF, where he rose through the ranks quickly due to his shining performances. Versatile and quick, Cazorla is primarily an attacking midfielder but can also play as a winger. His technical skills, such as high-speed dribbling, make him an effective contributor in the final third of the field. Cazorla, before his transfer to Arsenal, spent one season (2011-2012) at Málaga CF after his transfer from Villareal CF. His performances helped Málaga secure fourth place in La Liga and, subsequently, a spot in the following season's UEFA Champions League for the first time in the club's history. Arsenal FC, which is based in Islington, London, recruited Cazorla for £16 million in the summer of 2012. Arsène Wenger, the manager of Arsenal at the time, played a critical role in bringing Santi to the club. Wenger has a well-known penchant for moulding talented young players into international football stars, and it was no different in the case of Cazorla. Soon after his transfer, Cazorla quickly endeared himself to the Arsenal faithful with his impeccable technical skills and vision. Primarily playing as an attacking midfielder, he also often filled in as a central midfielder or winger. Known for his two-footedness, agility, and ability to score from free kicks, he had become an invaluable asset to the team. Cazorla's performances in the Premier League proved crucial in helping Arsenal maintain a consistent presence in the UEFA Champions League slots of the Premier League standings during his time at the club. Cazorla ended up spending six years with Arsenal, in which he secured two FA Cups and two Community Shields. He left the club in 2018 after a severe achilles tendon injury that almost ended his career. In conclusion, Santi Cazorla was signed by Arsenal FC for £16 million from Málaga CF, a Spanish football club, during the summer of 2012. His performances upon joining Arsenal only added to his reputation as a highly skilled and intelligent footballer. With exceptional skills and leadership qualities, Cazorla holds a position of admiration within the hearts of Arsenal FC fans and is remembered as a key figure in an exciting period for the club."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you are talking about a manual procedure or process, the answer could vary. 1. Reiterative tasks: Certain procedures are inherently repetitive and need to be carried out from the start every time. For instance, baking a cake or preparing a meal, performing a scientific experiment, or even starting your computer — these all require going through the same procedure each time. 2. Learning and skill development: In the context of learning or developing skills, you often begin with a base procedure and modify it over time as you become more proficient or as you understand the task better. With learning, the procedure becomes easier and quicker, but you generally still start from the beginning. 3. Software or digital processes: For most digital processes, like running a program or software, or generating an output using a tool, there is usually a way to save your progress or settings. In this case, you wouldn't need to start from the beginning every time, but rather, you could pick up where you left off or use a similar configuration to start the process. 4. Continuous or iterative procedures: Some types of work or projects are iterative, in which the 'beginning' is flexible. For example, in project management, copying existing project plans to similar subsequent projects would save time and allow for continuous improvement. However, without more specific details about the context of the procedure in question, it is difficult to provide a tailored answer.

This reference to speed suggests that the customer's needs were not only met but delivered in a timely manner, a feature that most customers value in a service.

Answer the following question: Information: - EMI Records was a British record label founded by the music company of the same name in 1972 as its flagship label, and launched in January 1973 as the successor to its Columbia and Parlophone record labels. The label was later launched worldwide. - The Division Bell is the fourteenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd. It was released in the UK by EMI Records on 28 March 1994, and the US by Columbia Records on 4 April. - Columbia Records (also known simply as Columbia) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, Inc., the United States division of Sony Corporation. It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - \`\` A Great Day for Freedom '' is a song by Pink Floyd from their 1994 album , The Division Bell . - Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? What does 'shake' mean as regards to iPhone 4? What does the lock symbol with a circle around it on an iPhone mean?","completion":"No, the two questions do not hold the same meaning, as they are inquiring about different features on an iPhone. Let's break down both questions and explain their meanings in detail. 1. What does 'shake' mean as regards to iPhone 4? This question is asking about the 'shake' feature available on the iPhone 4 and later models. The 'shake' feature refers to a motion-based shortcut for certain in-built functionalities, enabled by the internal motion sensor called an accelerometer. On the iPhone 4, the 'shake' feature can be used to: - Undo/redo typing: When composing a text message or email, if you make a mistake or want to restore deleted text, you can simply shake the device, and it will ask if you would like to undo the action. Similarly, you can redo the typing by shaking the device once again. - Shake-to-shuffle: In the Music app, shaking the iPhone can prompt the app to play a random song from your music library. This feature is useful when you want to shuffle your songs without pressing any buttons. 2. What does the lock symbol with a circle around it on an iPhone mean? This question refers to a specific icon that can be found on the iPhone's status bar, usually at the top of the screen. iPhone has a feature called \\"Orientation Lock\\" or \\"Screen Rotation Lock,\\" which is symbolized by a lock with a circular arrow around it. When this icon is displayed, it signifies that the Orientation Lock is active. When the Orientation Lock is turned on, the device's screen will remain in portrait mode and won't rotate automatically when you rotate the phone. This feature is especially useful when reading while lying down or when using the phone in a situation where you want to keep the screen orientation fixed, regardless of the phone's position. To enable or disable the Orientation Lock, you can follow these steps: - Swipe up from the bottom of the screen (iPhone 8 or older) or swipe down from the top right corner of the screen (iPhone X and later) to access the Control Center. - Look for the Orientation Lock button, which is the icon of a lock with a circular arrow around it. - Tap the Orientation Lock button to enable or disable it. When it's enabled, the icon will be highlighted, and the lock symbol with a circle around it will appear in the status bar. In conclusion, while both questions are related to the iPhone's features, they are fundamentally different in terms of their meanings and the functionalities they represent. The first question focuses on the 'shake' feature, while the second question is concerned with the icon that represents the \\"Orientation Lock\\" feature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Born in Venice, Ohio, Alson spent much of his childhood on a farm in Morning Sun; when he was a teenager, the family moved to Darrtown. Alston attended Milford Township High School in Darrtown, and received the nickname \\"Smokey\\" as a high school pitcher, owing to the speed of his fastball. He graduated from high school in 1929 and married longtime girlfriend Lela Vaughn Alexander the next year. In 1935, Alston graduated with a degree in industrial arts and physical education from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The team finished 21 games back in seventh place (71-83 (.461)) in 1958, the club's first season in Los Angeles. Criticism of Alston had begun to mount during that season, but he led the Dodgers to a world championship in 1959. Six players on the 1959 team finished with double-digit totals in home runs, while 22-year-old Don Drysdale led the team's pitchers with 17 wins. Several Los Angeles players, including Wally Moon, characterized Alston as indecisive in the late 1950s and 1960s. However, Moon later came to describe Alston as a good manager who had gotten \\"good mileage\\" out of his players. Managing the NL All-Star Team in 1960, Alston attracted some controversy when he left ]]1960 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves]] pitchers Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette off the roster. An Associated Press report said the omission may have been a snub directed at Dressen, who was the manager in Milwaukee. The 1960 Dodgers finished in fourth place. The following year, the team finished in second place after veteran Duke Snider missed two months with a broken arm. The Dodgers lost the lead in the 1962 NL pennant race and rumors surfaced that Alston and coach Leo Durocher might be fired, but the team retained both for 1963. The Dodgers swept the World Series in 1963, the first time that the New York Yankees had lost a World Series in four games. Alston's pitchers excelled, as Koufax struck out 23 batters over two games and Drysdale threw a shutout in Game 3. Over the four games, Alston employed only four pitchers: three starters and one reliever. The 1964 team was 80-82, its first losing season in several years. Alston used the team's 1964 performance to motivate them moving forward. In spring training before the 1965 season, he said that he would not let his team forget the difficulties they had in the previous season. The Dodgers returned to the World Series in 1965 against Minnesota. Alston could not start his number one pitcher, Koufax, in the opening game on October 6 because Koufax was observing Yom Kippur. Instead, Alston turned to Drysdale, who struggled and surrendered seven runs in just 2 2/3 innings. When Alston came to the mound to remove him in the bottom of the third, Drysdale quipped, \\"I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too.\\" The team recovered from losing that first game and they won the World Series in seven games. Koufax appeared in three games during the series, registering two shutouts. Alston's Dodgers teams of the 1960s benefited from the strong pitching by Drysdale and Koufax. In 1966, both players held out of spring training and demanded three-year contracts each worth 500,000, which was more money than anyone was making in baseball at the time. The players were eventually signed for lesser amounts. Drysdale struggled that year, but Koufax won 27 games. The Dodgers returned to the World Series, but were swept by the Baltimore Orioles. Koufax retired after the season on the advice of doctors who examined his sore arm. Drysdale retired three years later. Both men had pitched their entire major league careers for Alston.

Please answer the following question: Given the fact that: Less massive objects also have less gravity than more massive objects. Answer the question: Dan's small globe will have this kind of gravity compared to his larger globe: more or less? Answer:","completion":"Dan's small globe will have less gravity compared to his larger globe. This is due to the direct relationship between mass and gravity, as stated in your initial fact. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this can be represented as: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Here, F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.67430 x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2), m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between the centers of the objects. With this in mind, it's clear that an increase in mass corresponds to an increase in gravitational force, and vice versa. Therefore, when comparing the gravity of Dan's small globe to that of his larger globe, we can determine that the smaller globe will have less gravity due to its smaller mass. Additionally, the surface gravity of an object (which is the gravitational force experienced by a person or an object on its surface) is also related to its mass and radius. Surface gravity is given by the equation: g = G * (M / r^2) Where g is the surface gravity, M is the mass of the object, and r is its radius. It's important to note that in this equation, the mass of the object affects the surface gravity directly, whereas the radius affects it indirectly. Doubling the mass of an object would double its surface gravity, while halving its radius would quadruple its surface gravity due to the squared term in the denominator. Consequently, a smaller globe, which usually has a smaller mass and radius, would have less gravity than a larger globe. In conclusion, Dan's smaller globe will have less gravity in comparison to his larger globe due to the direct relationship between an object's mass and the strength of its gravitational force. This concept is based on the principles of Newton's law of universal gravitation, as well as the surface gravity equation, which both directly relate mass to gravity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Arrival Movie plot: Zane Zaminski (Charlie Sheen), a radio astronomer working for SETI, discovers an extraterrestrial radio signal from Wolf 336, a star 14 light years from Earth. Zane reports this to his supervisor, Phil Gordian (Ron Silver) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, but Phil dismisses the claims. Zane soon finds that he has been fired because of supposed budget cuts, and blacklisted, preventing him from working at other telescopes. Taking a job as a television satellite installer, he creates his own telescope array using his customers' dishes in the neighborhood, operating it secretly from his attic with help of his young next door neighbor, Kiki.Zane relocates the signal, but it is drowned out by a terrestrial signal from a Mexican radio station. Zane attempts to tell his former coworker, Calvin (Richard Schiff), but finds he has just died suspiciously from carbon monoxide poisoning. Zane travels to Mexico and finds the radio station was burnt to the ground. Searching the local area, he comes across a new power plant. There, he helps climatologist Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse) protect her atmospheric analysis equipment from the plant's overzealous security forces. Ilana explains that the Earth's temperature has recently risen several degrees, melting the polar ice. She is investigating the power plant, one of several recently built, that appears to be the cause of this increase. The two are released, but without Ilana's equipment. Surprisingly, Zane realizes one of the guards could pass as the identical twin of his former boss, Phil, except that he is of Mexican ethnicity (whereas Phil is not). As Zane and Ilana regroup, Phil instructs some agents, posing as gardeners, to release an alien device in Zane's attic that creates a miniature black hole, consuming all of Zane's equipment.

Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Sinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s. While films appealed to him, being exceptionally self-confident, he was rarely enthusiastic towards his own acting, once remarking that \\"pictures stink\\". Sinatra made his film debut in 1941, performing in an uncredited sequence in Las Vegas Nights, singing \\"I'll Never Smile Again\\" with Tommy Dorsey's The Pied Pipers. In 1943 he had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in Charles Barton's Reveille with Beverly, making a brief appearance singing \\"Night and Day\\". The following year he was given his leading roles in Higher and Higher and Step Lively for RKO Pictures. In 1945, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cast Sinatra opposite Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson in the Technicolor musical Anchors Aweigh, in which he played a sailor on leave in Hollywood for four days. A major success, it garnered several Academy Award wins and nominations, and the song \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily\\", sung by Sinatra in the film, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 1946, Sinatra briefly appeared at the end of Richard Whorf's commercially successful Till the Clouds Roll By, a Technicolor musical biopic of Jerome Kern, in which he sang \\"Ol' Man River. In 1949, Sinatra co-starred with Gene Kelly in the Technicolor musical Take Me Out to the Ball Game, a film set in 1908, in which Sinatra and Kelly play baseball players who are part-time vaudevillians. He teamed up with Kelly for a third time in On the Town, playing a sailor on leave in New York City. Today the film is rated very highly by critics, and in 2006 it ranked No. 19 on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals. Both Double Dynamite (1951), an RKO Irving Cummings comedy produced by Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pevney's Meet Danny Wilson (1952) failed to make an impression.

It is a natural substance produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Which of these statements is WRONG? A) HGH is a natural substance.

Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory and left me deeply disappointed. To start, we had a reservation for 8:00 PM, and upon arrival, the hostess informed us that our table was not yet available, with no explanation as to why or how long the wait would be. After waiting for 30 minutes, we were finally seated, but the inordinate wait time was already causing frustration amongst our party. Once seated, things did not improve. Our server was inattentive and seemingly disinterested in providing a pleasant dining experience. It took a while for our drink orders to be taken, and even longer for them to arrive. I understand that restaurants can get busy, but it felt as though our server had completely forgotten about us. The food, which I had such high hopes for, was equally disappointing. I ordered the grilled salmon with mango salsa, and it arrived overcooked and dry. The mango salsa, which I expected to be fresh and zesty, seemed to consist mostly of unripe fruit, leaving a very unappealing taste. My partner's dish, the chicken alfredo, was also subpar - the sauce was bland and tasteless, and the pasta was undercooked. Furthermore, the restaurant was very noisy and chaotic, making conversation difficult. It seemed as though the staff was overwhelmed, as we could observe confusion among the servers as they brought dishes to the wrong tables multiple times. Lastly, when it came time for the bill, we noticed that we were charged for an extra appetizer that we hadn't ordered. It took quite a while to flag down our server and have the error corrected, prolonging the already unpleasant experience. In summary, I cannot recommend The Fancy Fork based on my experience. Between the poor service, long wait times, subpar food, and chaotic atmosphere, it fell significantly short of my expectations. It's evident that the restaurant needs some serious improvements both in terms of customer service and food quality to earn my trust back and justify their relatively high prices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

William McKinley (January 29, 1843 - September 14, 1901) was the 25th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1897 until his assassination in September 1901, six months into his second term. McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish-American War, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of free silver (effectively, expansionary monetary policy). McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War, and the only one to have started the war as an enlisted soldier, beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major. William McKinley Jr. was born in 1843 in Niles, Ohio, the seventh child of William McKinley Sr. and Nancy (nee Allison) McKinley (1809-1897). The McKinleys were of English and Scots-Irish descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century, tracing back to a David McKinley who was born in Dervock, County Antrim, in present-day Northern Ireland. There, the elder McKinley was born in Pine Township, Mercer County. The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, settling in New Lisbon (now Lisbon). He met Nancy Allison there, and married her later. The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania's earliest settlers. The family trade on both sides was iron-making, and McKinley senior operated foundries throughout Ohio, in New Lisbon, Niles, Poland, and finally Canton. The McKinley household was, like many from Ohio's Western Reserve, steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment, the latter based on the family's staunch Methodist beliefs. William followed in the Methodist tradition, becoming active in the local Methodist church at the age of sixteen. He was a lifelong pious Methodist. In 1852, the family moved from Niles to Poland, Ohio so that their children could attend the better schools there. Graduating from Poland Seminary in 1859, he enrolled the following year at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He remained at Allegheny for only one year, returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed. He also spent time at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio as a board member. Although his health recovered, family finances declined and McKinley was unable to return to Allegheny, first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near Poland, Ohio.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: did he have any siblings?","completion":"Yes, William McKinley Jr. had siblings.

Given the context: How would Aubrey feel afterwards? A:","completion":"Given the context provided, it would seem that Aubrey could be feeling a mix of emotions and physical sensations after a long and tiring day at work. Here's a detailed and thorough analysis of those emotions and sensations: 1. Exhaustion: After a long day at work, Aubrey is likely feeling physically and mentally tired. This exhaustion might manifest as sore muscles or an aching body, making Aubrey eager to get home, rest, and perhaps take a warm shower or bath to help alleviate some of the discomfort. 2. Relief: Upon arriving home to Alex, Aubrey might experience a feeling of relief at being in a familiar and comfortable environment. Being with a loved one or at a place where one feels safe and secure can help alleviate the stress and tension accumulated during the workday. 3. Gratitude: Aubrey might feel grateful to have a support system in Alex, with whom they can share their experiences or vent their frustrations. Knowing there is someone willing to listen, offer advice, or provide emotional support can be invaluable in helping cope with life's challenges. 4. Happiness: Despite the challenges of the day, Aubrey might feel happiness when returning to Alex, their loved one. The affection, love, and companionship shared between them can contribute to overall happiness even after a tough day at work. 5. Hunger or Thirst: After a long and tiring day, Aubrey might feel the need to replenish their energy through food and drink. They might look forward to a home-cooked meal or a simple snack, as well as a refreshing beverage to rehydrate and regain some stamina. 6. Need for Decompression: It's not unusual for people to need some time to decompress after a stressful day. Aubrey could potentially prefer to engage in a calming activity like reading, watching TV, meditating, or listening to music to help relax and ease into their time at home. 7. Desire for Connection: Work might have left Aubrey feeling disconnected from their personal life or hobbies. As a result, they may wish to set aside time to connect with Alex, participate in a joint activity, or indulge in a favorite pastime to regain a sense of balance. Taking all of these factors into account, it is clear that Aubrey would likely experience a complex mix of emotions and physical sensations after a long and tiring day at work. While exhaustion might be the most immediate and apparent feeling, other emotions like relief, happiness, and gratitude may also arise as they reunite with Alex in the comfort of their home."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Cut the meat against the grain. Article:","completion":"Title: Fun Ways to Cook Pork for Tasty Meals Hi little friends! Today we are going to talk about cooking a yummy food called pork. Pork comes from pigs, and there are many fun ways to cook it. Let's learn about five awesome methods to make amazingly tasty pork meals. 1. Searing and Baking Pork: First, we can make our pork tasty by searing it. Searing means cooking it quickly on high heat to make it brown on the outside. Then, we put it into the oven to bake until it's fully cooked inside. \\"Bake\\" means to cook something using the heat from the oven. This way, our pork will be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! 2. Braising Pork: The next fun way to cook our pork is called braising. To braise pork, we first cook it a little on high heat to make it brown. Then, we add some liquid, like water, juice, or broth, and cook the pork more slowly on low heat. This will make the pork very tender and full of flavor from the liquid! 3. Smoking Pork: Another amazing way to cook pork is by smoking it. We cook the pork using a special cooking tool called a smoker, which uses the smoke from wood or other materials to give the pork a unique, smoky flavor. This method takes a bit longer, but it makes the pork taste extra-delicious! 4. Stewing Pork: Stewing is another fun way to cook our pork. To do this, we chop the pork into smaller pieces and cook it in a big pot with some liquid, like water or broth. We can add other ingredients, like vegetables and seasonings, to make the stew tasty. We simmer the stew, which means cooking it slowly just below boiling point until the pork is tender and the flavors mix together. 5. Slow-Cooking Pork: Slow-cooking is a super easy way to cook our pork. We put the pork into a special cooking pot called a slow-cooker, add our favorite ingredients, and let the slow-cooker do its magic! It cooks our pork slowly and gently, making it super tender and juicy. Now that our pork is cooked, let's make sure it tastes great. Before we eat it, we should let the pork rest for a few minutes. This helps it stay juicy and tender. When it's time to cut and eat our pork, we cut it against the grain. That means we cut it in the opposite direction of the lines we see on the meat. This will make our pork easier to chew and full of yummy flavors. Happy cooking, little chefs! I hope you have fun trying all these tasty ways to cook pork. Remember to ask an adult to help you with these cooking methods for a fantastic and delicious meal!"},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

(Published Tuesday, Nov. 28, 2017) A Spring Valley woman was killed, and her husband is missing after the couple went on a river outing on the big island of Hawaii over the weekend. Police said 62-year-old Gladys Novinger fell into the water Saturday while crossing the Wailuku River above Rainbow Falls. The Novingers were reportedly in Hawaii to visit family in the area. The wife was found in the pool below the falls and was airlifted to Hilo Medical Center where she died. The husband, 61-year-old George Novinger, is yet to be found and rescue efforts were suspended due to bad weather. Heavy rain and flash flooding forced rescuers to suspend their search Monday, and authorities said bad weather is still hampering their efforts on Tuesday. The Novingers own Vineyard Hacienda in Spring Valley. Gladys Novinger helped to found the House of Peru, which is in the process of having its own cottage built at the International Cottages in Balboa Park. George Novinger recently retired as a diplomat for the U.S. State Department's Foreign Service. He also served as the Chairman of the International Cottage Committee and spoke last year to NBC 7 about the group's efforts to expand the International Cottages to include more nine additional nations including Mexico, India, Palestine and Peru. In that interview, Novinger said the International Cottages are designed to bring nations together, as a place to celebrate the art, food and culture of different countries. The Rainbow Falls waterfall stands about 80 feet high and is a popular tourist attraction located on the northwest border of Hilo. With a viewing area just east of the falls, people can walk out onto the rocks and get a close view of the waterfall from above. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video SPRING VALLEY, Calif. - Recovery crews in Hawaii will resume their search Tuesday for a missing Spring Valley man and former U.S. diplomat believed to be dead after his wife was found dead when the couple was swept into a river above a tall waterfall over the weekend. The body of Gladys Novinger, 62, was found Saturday afternoon in the pool below the 80-foot tall Rainbow Falls on the Wailuku River in Hilo on the Big Island of Hawaii, according to local media reports. Police and firefighters looking for her husband, 61-year-old George Novinger, have been hampered by poor weather and suspended the search Sunday and Monday. Authorities told local news outlets on the Big Island that the couple was swept toward Rainbow Falls on Saturday afternoon while trying to cross the river about 100 feet above the waterfall, which is a popular tourist destination. Gladys Novinger was not breathing and had no pulse when she was pulled from the water below the waterfall and taken by helicopter to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead around 4:30 p.m. Saturday. The search for George Novinger's body was suspended Sunday because of dangerous conditions and most of Monday because of heavy rain, according to reports. Along with Gladys' son, Joseph Harmes III, the Novingers owned Vineyard Hacienda east of Steele Canyon High School off Campo Road in Rancho San Diego. The couples' long time friend, Stephanie Ward says Gladys worked tirelessly no matter what she put her mind, \\"and volunteered on many civic boards and was always giving back. If you were sick in the hospital Gladys was the first one there.\\" According to their website, George Novinger was a \\"recently retired diplomat for the U.S. State Department's Foreign Service\\" who specialized in East Asian affairs. \\"He served our country in Japan (three times), South Korea, Hong Kong, Brunei and Paraguay before completing his overseas diplomatic postings as Deputy Chief of Mission at the American Embassy in Damascus, Syria,\\" according to the Vineyard Hacienda website. \\"His final position before retirement was as the State Department's Regional Director of Foreign Missions in Southwestern states.\\" George Novinger was also president of Balboa Park's House of Peru, which Peruvian-born Gladys helped found with her son and two daughters, according to the Vineyard Hacienda website. Aside from designing and planting the East County vineyard and raising her family, Gladys Novinger also \\"served as Honorary Consul of Peru and on the executive board of the Museum of Man in Balboa Park,\\" according to her biography. She was also a board member of the Boys and Girls Foundation and other community organizations. Together she and George worked to bring the House of Peru to life in Balboa Park, sadly they were to break ground next month. Vice President of the House of Peru Oscar Urteaga says Gladys and George represent the best of San Diego, \\"they are involved in civic organizations, fundraising, they own businesses, they are family people - they really are the best San Diego has.\\" Gladys son will return to San Diego from Hawaii on Thursday. No word on funeral arrangements. ||||| An East County woman was killed and her husband was missing after the couple was swept down a river in Hawaii over the weekend on a trip that was supposed to be an early Christmas present.

Rescuers found Gladys Novinger unconscious and transported her to a hospital, where she later died, police said. An aerial search for her husband resumed Tuesday. Rainy weather caused flash-flood conditions and prevented a ground search, a fire department dispatcher said. Novinger had told friends he was taking his wife to Hawaii as an early Christmas gift. Gladys Novinger’s son, Joseph Harmes III, said he was with the couple when they were swept away. “They were the best of the best. It is beyond tragic. They are missed deeply,” he said in an email. “I will always carry them in my heart. And I dedicate my life to their legacy.” The couple owned the Hacienda Vineyards in Rancho San Diego and were considered pillars in San Diego’s international community. Gladys Novinger, who was born in Peru, served as Honorary Consul of Peru and founded the House of Peru about 16 years ago. She also was on the executive board of the Museum of Man in Balboa Park and the board of the Boys and Girls Foundation. She developed Hacienda Vineyards with her late father, Abelardo, in the 1990s. The business hosts destination vacations, retreats and other events. George Novinger recently retired as a diplomat for the U.S. State Department’s Foreign Service, where he specialized in East Asian regional affairs and served in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Brunei, Paraguay and Syria. Before retiring, he was the State Department’s regional director of foreign missions in southwestern states, serving as a liaison to embassies and consuls in the southwest region of the U.S. Mark Robak, a member of the Otay Water District Board, said he attended a dinner at the couple’s home a few years ago when they were hosting a delegation of dignitaries from Japan That’s when he learned that Novinger was fluent in Japanese. “George was a true Renaissance man,” Robak said. “The guy was really all over the world.” Novinger was on the Jamul-Dulzura community planning group and was active with international groups, including the House of Pacific Relations, the San Diego World Affairs Council and the city of San Diego’s International Affairs Board. “He was always someone who knew the proper protocols to meet with international delegations,” said Joel Day, executive director of San Diego’s International Affairs Board. “He would be the person representing San Diego when mayors or officials or delegations would come in to visit the city. He was sort of the face of San Diego.” As chair of the board’s public policy committee, Novinger led discussions about protecting refugees and new immigrants in San Diego and was instrumental in the board publicly opposing the travel ban issued by the Trump Administration earlier this year, Day said. Gladys Novinger had worked tirelessly on fundraising and promoting the building of a cottage for the House of Peru in Balboa Park — construction that is set to begin next month, said Oscar Urteaga, the House of Peru’s vice president. He said George Novinger had volunteered to work as a type of project manager for all nine new international cottages that are planned. “Both families have asked that if people want to make a donation, if they are inclined, to make it to the HouseofPeru.org in memory and recognition of Gladys and George,” Urteaga said.

Ash was worried how it would go, but according to Ash it went well. Given the question \\"What does Ash need to do before this?\\", is \\"do a good job\\" a valid answer?","completion":"The answer \\"do a good job\\" might be a valid answer in some contexts, but to determine its validity in this particular situation, it would be helpful to have more information about the specific context and background. The information provided is quite limited, which makes it challenging to understand the exact nature of the task or scenario Ash was dealing with. Consequently, to provide a more comprehensive response, let's explore various interpretations of the question and the validity of \\"do a good job\\" as an answer. Interpretation 1: Preparation for an event or task If Ash was preparing for an event, meeting, or task, the general advice of \\"doing a good job\\" might imply that Ash should focus on performing well in that endeavor. However, this answer is somewhat vague and ambiguous, without providing specific guidance or actionable steps for Ash to follow. In this context, more detailed and tailored advice would be preferable, such as \\"thoroughly research the topic, practice your presentation, and be prepared to answer questions confidently.\\" Interpretation 2: A skill or qualification needed If the question \\"What does Ash need to do before this?\\" is referring to a specific skill or qualification Ash must obtain before proceeding to the next step, \\"do a good job\\" may not be a valid answer. In this case, an appropriate response would be to identify the specific skills, qualifications, or prerequisites Ash needs to fulfill before moving forward. For example, \\"Ash needs to complete a relevant training or certification program.\\" Interpretation 3: A requirement or condition to be fulfilled If there are certain requirements or conditions Ash must fulfill before proceeding, \\"do a good job\\" might be a valid answer depending on the exact nature of those requirements. For example, if the condition is to make a genuine effort and demonstrate commitment to the task, then doing a good job could be seen as a valid answer. However, if the requirement is more specific, such as submitting a particular document or achieving a specific outcome, this answer would be insufficient. In conclusion, whether \\"do a good job\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What does Ash need to do before this?\\" largely depends on the context and the details surrounding Ash's situation. While it might be a valid answer in some cases, such as when attempting to convey the importance of commitment and effort, more information is needed to determine its validity in this specific scenario.

UPDATED:. 12:14 EST, 18 December 2012. Punishment: Nurse Stephen Johnson faces being struck off for his treatment of mentally ill patients. A senior nurse who goose-stepped around a room of mentally ill patients while performing Nazi salutes faces being struck off. Stephen Johnson put a finger under his nose to represent. a Hitler moustache and marched around the NHS care home in Essex like Basil Fawlty in the comedy classic Fawlty Towers. He reduced a patient who suffered from delusions that he was Adolf Hitler to tears. The patient – identified as Patient C – had a strange obsession with Nazi Germany and suffered from hallucinations. Johnson cruelly. encouraged him to live out his fantasy by performing the. salutes made famous by the Nazi regime and shouting 'Heil Hitler', a. Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) panel found. The nurse’s behaviour came to light. when bosses at the North Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. investigated a seven-month campaign of sexual harassment against a. Polish colleague, known only as Miss A. The. former deputy ward manager, who had worked at Severalls House in Colchester for more than two decades, made the Nazi salutes in front of Miss A and a male Jewish colleague, known as Mr D. Johnson, 54, flies a St George’s flag from his home in. Essex. He was. yesterday found guilty of eight allegations of misconduct in 2008 and. 2009. He sent explicit messages to the Miss A, groped Mr D and made racist remarks, and repeatedly grabbed a male patient's genitals. Karen Russell, who still works at the. ward, told the hearing: ‘He would mimic the patient who had been. doing the Nazi salutes. ‘He would be marching up and down saluting and shouting.' She said he would raise his arm to a Nazi salute with a finger below her nose. Guilt: A panel at the Nursing and Midwifery Council, pictured, found Stephen Johnson, 54, guilty of eight allegations of misconduct in 2008 and 2009. She added: ‘It would wind [patient C] up and he would cry. He [Johnson] would do the baiting.’ Miss Russell told the hearing that the patient had an obsession. with Nazi Germany and would suffer hallucinations. She added: ‘The patient would often speak in a German accent and go on about Nazi Germany. He’d say he was Adolf Hitler.’ Chris Renehan, the clinical manager at the time, told the panel Johnson would incite the patient to shout ‘Heil Hitler’. Mr Renehan, who now works at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, added: ‘Mr Johnson was very black and white. ‘He either liked you or he didn’t – and that tended to be people that were ethnic minority or people not English. ‘He was very English. Very British.’ He also performed the role of a German soldier in front of Miss A, which she was said to find ‘particularly offensive as she is Polish, and associations with the Second World War have particularly offensive significance to her.’ Johnson, who lives in a quiet cul de sac in Great Horkesley, Colchester, called Mr D by the names of Arab terrorist organisations, Hezbollah and Hamas, and once said to him, ‘BNP go home’. The male care assistant also reported Johnson to police for grabbing his genitals at work while another colleague. pinned his arms behind his back. Torment: Johnson reduced a patient who suffered from delusions that he was Adolf Hitler, pictured, to tears. Johnson denied the charges, accusing colleagues of conspiring against him and making him a scapegoat. But James Spencer, chair of the NMC panel, said: 'The panel is not. satisfied that any of the witnesses have colluded, that Mr Johnson has. been made a scapegoat or accused of any of these things for any reason. other than the facts included in the charges.' The panel also found Johnson guilty of grabbing another patient's genitals on an almost daily basis. Miss Russell said in a. statement: 'Mr Johnson would stand facing him and hold the patient's. genitals through his clothing. 'Mr Johnson would grab the patient's genitals all the time, I would say this happened on a nearly daily basis. 'He did it to make people laugh, the staff would laugh.' Johnson's campaign of harassment began just three weeks. after Miss A joined Severalls House, after the pair took a. patient on a trip to London. 'Mr Johnson sent a pornographic photograph of a woman's vagina', said Mr Unwin. 'She found this disgusting, showed the. picture to her boyfriend, and then deleted it. She replied to Mr. Johnson, telling him to grow up.' But Johnson continued to bombard her with messages, saying, 'You sexy momma, I love you.' He added: 'Don't you give up on me' and 'I want to complete you :) xxxxx', and repeatedly tried to call her at midnight. 'Mr Johnson himself performed a Nazi salute while in her presence and while looking at her,' added Mr Unwin. 'She found this particularly offensive. as she is Polish, and associations with the Second World War have. particularly offensive significance to her.' 'Miss A felt threatened by his conduct. and felt that if she didn't tell Mr Johnson what he wanted to hear he. would make her life at work very difficult.' Unacceptable: Johnson's tasteless behaviour is reminiscent of a memorable scene in Fawlty Towers in which Basil Fawlty goose-steps around his hotel. The tribunal heard the sexual. texts stopped when Johnson's wife, who also works at the trust, saw. a message and called Miss A to confront her. After Miss A reported Johnson's advances, Mr D came forward to report the deputy ward manager. for groping him while on duty. Mr D described one incident in October. 2008 when Johnson and another member of staff allegedly ambushed him. while he was looking through a colleague's holiday photos. He said he was standing outside Severalls House, when Johnson and the male member of staff 'jumped' on him. 'He (the other male) grabbed both my hands behind my back, Mr Johnson grabbed my genitals outside of my clothes,' he said. The. panel was told that the staff nurse Mr D had been speaking to at the. time was still present and took a photograph of the incident. 'It is not acceptable in my country or my culture,' said Mr D. 'I was very offended and felt violated. 'Mr Johnson had no respect for any staff members at Severalls House.' Mr D told the panel the insults happened almost every shift at the care home. Johnson. was arrested by police and questioned on suspicion of groping Mr D in. January 2010, but was later released without charge. Johnson resigned from the trust in August 2010 before a full disciplinary process could take place. He admitted sending the texts to Miss A, but claimed it was part of a two-way consensual conversation. Johnson. said the thought of being in the same building as Mr D 'makes me feel. sick', and did not attend the central London hearing. Johnson's fitness to practice was later found to be impaired by reason of misconduct at the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Panel chair James Spencer said: 'It is unlikely Mr Johnson would have treated a patient without a mental health disability in this manner and his conduct amounts to discrimination on the basis of disability. 'He abused his senior position and did not treat patients or staff with respect or dignity. 'The panel has determined that Mr Johnson's fitness to practice is impaired by reason of his misconduct.' The panel will now consider what sanction to impose upon Johnson. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses the case of Stephen Johnson, a senior nurse who performed Nazi salutes and goose-stepped around a room of mentally ill patients at an NHS care home in Essex.

It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

Answer this question please: Which sibling didn't have hyperopia?","completion":"In the given situation, two siblings, Jane and Matt, needed eyeglasses. Out of the two, Matt was nearsighted while Jane was farsighted. Since farsightedness is also known as hyperopia, we can deduce that Jane had hyperopia due to her farsighted vision.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless.

That was your best one yet.\\" Yeah it was. I'm sure he still has a lot of hope. But I would dare to say the thing that changed most over these past three years is Obama. The unbridled optimism that his first campaign once embodied has been bludgeoned by dogmatism, pragmatism and bipartisan cronyism. Hope and change are tough when the worst economy in 80 years is waiting to greet you at the door. Hope and change are challenging when Rush Limbaugh, the unofficial gatekeeper of the conservative movement, tells his troops \\"I hope Obama fails\\" before your first day on the job.

Also charged with possession and distribution of of indecent images. Singer appeared before magistrates in Cardiff today, along with two others.","completion":"Title: Ian Watkins, Former Frontman of Lostprophets, Arrested and Charged with Shocking Child Exploitation Crimes Former frontman of the successful rock band Lostprophets, Ian Watkins, has recently found himself at the center of a deeply disturbing and ongoing police investigation involving child exploitation crimes. In a dramatic turn of events that has stunned his fans and the general public alike, the 35-year-old singer has been arrested on serious charges including conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a girl under the age of 13. Additionally, Watkins faces accusations of possession and distribution of indecent images of minors, further marring his public image and leaving many to question the extent of his involvement in such sinister activities. Arrested alongside Watkins are two other individuals suspected to be accomplices to his alleged crimes. Today, all three parties involved made a somber appearance before the magistrates in Cardiff, where Watkins will be provided a full legal trial to face the accusations leveled against him. While the police investigation into the matter continues, the case has been treated with immense gravity, with authorities doing their best to uncover the extent of Watkins' alleged crimes and potential connections to other conspirators. The rock singer, who rose to fame as the charismatic leader of a popular band, seems to find himself at the heart of an utterly grim story that is unfolding before the eyes of the nation. The charges against Ian Watkins have understandably elicited reactions of shock, disgust, and anger from not only his fans and former admirers but also communities who increasingly confront the dark reality of child exploitation and abuse. By bringing attention to the often-hidden horrors of this societal tragedy through Watkins' high-profile arrest, it is hoped that the case will act as a catalyst for broader public awareness and more robust action against all forms of abuse against minors. The severe nature of Watkins' alleged crimes compels society to renew its focus on the protection and welfare of vulnerable children, as well as the importance of vigilance, prevention, and education in matters of child exploitation. The unfolding saga also raises numerous critical questions concerning the involvement of those with influence and power in abhorrent practices, necessitating a wider conversation on how to effectively combat and bring an end to such predatory behavior. As the police investigation continues to progress, it remains to be seen what the outcome of Watkins' case will be as the legal system endeavors to bring justice and a sense of closure to all parties affected by this disquieting scandal. In the meantime, as the public wrestles with the unthinkable charges brought upon the once-revered Lostprophets' frontman, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the need for greater societal awareness and action to eliminate the unthinkable horrors of child exploitation. Our collective vigilance, compassion, and determination are crucial in defending the innocence of vulnerable children and ensuring that offenders, regardless of their public standing or influence, are held to account for their abominable actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: STOCKHOLM, Oct.11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese writer Mo Yan has won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature, announced Peter Englund, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on Thursday. The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 is awarded to Chinese writer Mo Yan \\"who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary,\\" said Englund at a press conference. Mo Yan, a pseudonym for Guan Moye, was born in 1955 and grew up in Gaomi in Shandong province in eastern China.His parents were farmers. As a 12-year-old during the Cultural Revolution he left school to work, first in agriculture, later in a factory.In 1976 he joined the People's Liberation Army and during this time began to study literature and write.His first short story was published in a literary journal in 1981. \\"In his writing, Mo Yan draws on his youthful experiences and on settings in the province of his birth.This is apparent in his novel Hong gaoliang jiazu (1987, in English Red Sorghum 1993),\\" said the academy in a statement of Mo's biography. The book consists of five stories that unfold and interweave in Gaomi in several turbulent decades in the 20th century, with depictions of bandit culture, the Japanese occupation and the harsh conditions endured by poor farm workers, according to the biography.Red Sorghum was successfully filmed in 1987, directed by famous Chinese director Zhang Yimou. Through a mixture of fantasy and reality, historical and social perspectives, Mo Yan has created a world reminiscent in its complexity of those in the writings of William Faulkner and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, at the same time finding a departure point in old Chinese literature and in oral tradition, the academy commented in the biographical statement. In addition to his novels, Mo Yan has published many short stories and essays on various topics.In spite of his social criticism, he is seen in his homeland as one of the foremost contemporary authors, the statement added.

Movie plot title: Never Cry Wolf Movie plot: Young, naive Canadian biologist Tyler (Charles Martin Smith) is assigned by the government to travel to the isolated Canadian arctic wilderness and study why the area's caribou population is declining, believed to be due to wolf-pack attacks; amongst his orders to study them he is also given a gun and required to kill one wolf and examine its stomach contents. Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler in the middle of a sub-zero frozen Arctic lake. Tyler is at a loss of what to do about his situation until he is rescued by a traveling Inuit named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who transports him and his gear off the ice and builds a shelter for him. Alone, Tyler divides his days between research and survival, while nights are fraught with nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves â which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them. He and the wolves begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them. Noticing that they haven't eaten any caribou and only mice, he begins a side experiment of eating only mice for protein sustenance. Another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) encounters Tyler, sent by Ootek for companionship. Mike knows English and Inuit, translating between Ootek and Tyler. Ootek, the elder, is content and curious about Tyler, while the younger Mike seems not only more reserved but unhappy with the Inuit way of life, confessing to Tyler his social apprehensions, this is mainly due to the fact that Mike is missing nearly all his teeth as well as telling Tyler about the time he met a girl and how she was comfortable with him until he smiled.

He was on a journey to the International Space Station. It might have been a routine trip for the two astronauts who were traveling with him, but for him it was certainly no ordinary journey. Dennis Tito was the first tourist ever in space, and he had paid the sum of 20 million to go there. As the spacecraft left the earth's atmosphere, Tito drank a glass of fruit juice to celebrate and looked down at the earth's blue-green surface. Two minutes later, he was sick. Luckily it was only a minor problem. He soon recovered, and from then on enjoyed a smooth journey. When he arrived at the space station, there was a big smile on his face. \\"A great trip!\\" he commented. \\"I love space.\\" For a long time space travel was something for heroes.

Mexican authorities say the more than 500 illegal immigrants they detained Tuesday wanted to reach the United States and each had paid 7,000 to get there. But by Wednesday, a day after X-ray equipment detected them at a highway checkpoint, the majority of them had been deported to their home countries in Central and South America. In a migrant detention center surrounded by high walls near Mexico's southern border, the remaining 23 immigrants, who hailed from countries as nearby as the Dominican Republic and as far away as Nepal, will wait as officials arrange their deportation. Immigrant detentions are nothing new in the southern Mexican border state of Chiapas, where at least 25,000 immigrants were apprehended last year. But the large number authorities found in two vehicles Tuesday was a startling reminder of the desperation that drives immigrants to risk dangerous conditions. The case drew national attention in Mexico, where the country's interior minister announced he would begin following the \\"migrant's route\\" through Mexico on Wednesday. The three-day trip was scheduled to include meetings on immigration with local officials and his Guatemalan counterpart. The vast majority of the immigrants detained Tuesday were from Guatemala, and all 410 of them had been handed over to Guatemalan police by Wednesday afternoon, according to Mexico's National Migration Institute. The 80 detained immigrants who hailed from El Salvador, Ecuador and Honduras were scheduled to be deported Wednesday evening. The immigrants who hailed from the Dominican Republic, India, Nepal, China and Japan awaited their fate Wednesday in Tapachula, Chiapas, at the recently renovated 21st Century Migration Station, Mexico's largest immigrant detention center. Experts say the passage of Central American immigrants through Mexico on their way to the United States is hardly a 21st century phenomenon. Immigration of Central Americans into the United States began to grow in the early 1980s, said Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington. And for at least 15 years, American authorities have been pushing Mexican officials to crack down on \\"transit migration.\\" \\"Going back to the 1990s when we start to engage Mexico, this has been one of the two main goals of our conversation,\\" Papademetriou said. But the Guatemala-Mexico border was easy to cross until recently, said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \\"There's more of a federal presence today than there's ever been, for two reasons,\\" he said. \\"One, because Mexico has been trying to make a case that the country is secure, and that they're doing their part on terrorism and on illegal immigration; but also, in part, because Mexico is very concerned about crime on the southern border.\\" That hasn't stopped immigrants from embarking on the journey, despite the dangers. \\"People are going to keep coming,\\" Selee said. \\"As bad as the economy has been in the U.S. over the past couple years, there are still people willing to take the risk of not finding a job because they also see no prospects where they are.\\" Journalist Angeles Mariscal of CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","completion":"Mexican authorities detained over 500 illegal immigrants that were crammed into two sweltering semi-trailers, attempting to reach the United States by paying 7,000 each. A majority of them were deported to their home countries in Central and South America by the following day. This case brought attention to the desperation immigrants face to find better prospects and safety, prompting Mexico's interior minister to follow the \\"migrant's route\\" through Mexico for further investigation. Immigrant detentions in the southern Mexican border state of Chiapas are not uncommon, with at least 25,000 immigrants apprehended just last year. Although the U.S. has been urging Mexico to crack down on \\"transit migration,\\" the Guatemala-Mexico border was easy to cross until recently. Increased federal presence seeks to improve the country's security against terrorism and illegal immigration, as well as addressing crime on the southern border.

Alvaro Negredo insists he is happy at Manchester City and has no desire to quit the Premier League champions. The 28-year-old has been consistently liked with a move back to Spain amid suggestions that he has struggled to adapt to life in the north of England. But now the Spaniard, nicknamed 'The Beast', has dismissed such speculation. 'I don’t want to leave City,' he told CityTV, 'I’m very happy and very settled here.

'I had a difficult end to the season and that’s why there has been a lot of talking but I’ve been very happy here from the first day I arrived.' After a blistering first half to the season that saw the Spain international become a favourite among City fans, the striker picked up a muscle injury that derailed his season. Edin Dzeko capitalised on his absence as the former Sevilla man continued to struggle with form and fitness, so much so that he failed to make Spain's World Cup squad.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Here's a question: The audience watched the principal speaking, where were they seated? Here are possible answers to this question: - sporting event - lecture - school - concert hall - hockey game I believe the correct choice is \\"school\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"school,\\" and here's a comprehensive analysis of why this is the most suitable answer among the options given: 1. Sporting event: While it is possible for a principal to address an audience at a sporting event, the question specifically mentions that the principal is \\"speaking\\". This implies that the focus is on the principal's speech, which doesn't happen frequently at a sporting event where the main focus is on the games or competitions. 2. Lecture: A lecture typically involves an expert or a teacher addressing a classroom or auditorium about a specific subject. Although a principal could potentially speak at a lecture, it is not a typical setting for a principal to address an audience. 3. School: This is the most appropriate answer, as a principal is an administrator who oversees a school. They are responsible for managing the staff, ensuring educational quality, and maintaining a safe and supportive school environment. It is highly common for a principal to address students, parents, or the school community in various school settings such as assemblies, parent meetings, or special events. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the audience would be seated in a school setting while watching the principal speaking. 4. Concert hall: A concert hall is primarily used for musical performances, and while it is not impossible for a principal to address an audience in a concert hall, it is not a typical venue for a principal's speech. There would need to be a specific reason for the event to take place at a concert hall, such as a music-related occasion or special function, which is not mentioned in the question. 5. Hockey game: Similar to a sporting event, a hockey game is an unlikely place to find a principal delivering a speech. It is not a common setting for a principal to address an audience, and the focus of the event would be on the game, not the speech. In conclusion, given the context of the principal speaking to an audience, the most logically appropriate setting is a school. Schools provide various opportunities for principals to communicate essential information or updates, instill values, or motivate students and the school community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"First, let's address each question separately and then discuss whether they are paraphrases of each other. 1. How can I treat purple spots on my tongue? Purple spots on the tongue can be caused by a variety of factors such as injury, infection, or certain medical conditions. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis before attempting any treatment. However, here are some general tips to treat and alleviate the discomfort associated with purple spots on the tongue: a. Maintain good oral hygiene: Make sure to brush your teeth and clean your tongue at least twice daily. Use a tongue scraper to remove bacteria and plaque buildup. b. Gargle with warm salt water: Gargling with lukewarm salt water several times a day can help cleanse your mouth and soothe any irritation or discomfort. c. Avoid irritants: Stay away from spicy, acidic, or very hot foods and beverages, as these can worsen the symptoms. Also, avoid using mouthwash that contains alcohol or harsh chemicals. d. Keep yourself hydrated: Drink plenty of water to maintain good saliva production, which can help to keep your mouth clean. e. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush: A gentle toothbrush can help prevent further irritation when cleaning your teeth and tongue. f. If the cause is infection, your healthcare professional may prescribe antibiotics, antifungal medications, or antiviral drugs, depending on the specific cause. Remember always to consult with a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation. 2. How do you treat a tiny blister on the tongue? A tiny blister on the tongue could be caused by factors such as accidental bites, burns, allergies, viral infections, or underlying health conditions. Here's how you can manage and treat a tiny blister on your tongue: a. Rinse with salt water: Gently swishing warm salt water in your mouth several times a day can help relieve discomfort and reduce inflammation. b. Take over-the-counter pain relievers: Non-prescription pain medications, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help to reduce pain and inflammation. c. Apply a topical oral anesthetic: Products like Orajel or Anbesol can provide temporary relief from pain caused by the blister. d. Apply a cold compress: Hold an ice cube or cold cloth against the blister for a few minutes at a time to reduce inflammation. e. Avoid irritants: Steer clear of spicy, acidic, or hot foods and beverages while the blister is healing. Stay away from tobacco products as well. f. Maintain good oral hygiene: Brush your teeth and clean your tongue at least twice daily, and use a gentle mouthwash. Again, always consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. While both questions relate to oral health issues, they are quite different in their specific concerns. The first question asks about treating purple spots on the tongue, which can be related to a variety of causes like injury, infection, or certain medical conditions. The second question, on the other hand, deals with treating a tiny blister on the tongue, which can also have various causes such as burns, accidental bites, or viral infections. Both questions require different treatment approaches and advice, as illustrated in the responses above."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Neil didn't think that Derrick should pay for the damage to their car, because","completion":"it was ultimately his own negligence that had led to the unfortunate incident. The two friends, Neil and Derrick, had been on their way to a weekend camping trip in the mountains when their car skidded off the slippery road and crashed into a tree. The car was a total wreck, but both of them had miraculously escaped without any serious injuries. The series of events that led to the accident unfolded rapidly. Neil, being a daredevil and always eager to show off his driving skills, decided to take the winding mountain roads at a rather high speed – much faster than what was necessary. Derrick constantly tried to convince Neil to slow down, warning him of the impending danger, but to no avail. As their tires screeched, blending with the sound of treacherous laughter emanating from Neil's lips, Derrick mentally braced himself for a disaster waiting to unfold. Within a blink of an eye, their car hit a particularly slippery patch on the road and swung uncontrollably. The inevitable happened; the car careened and collided with the unforgiving tree. Neil was left stunned, realizing that he had made a grave mistake. Instead of admitting his responsibility and offering to pay for the damage, Neil quickly came up with an excuse to deflect the blame onto Derrick. He argued that Derrick should pay for the damages since it was Derrick's car in the first place, and he was the one who had invited Neil on the trip. Derrick felt betrayed and devastated. As the two friends found themselves caught in a heated argument, a wise old man who had witnessed the incident from a distance approached them calmly. He had seen the whole event unfold, having lived in the mountains for decades, he knew the secrets of its dangerous curves. The old man interjected, \\"The time has come for you two to stop bickering and to realize the truth behind the situation. It is not about who should pay the damages, rather the lesson this experience has taught you.\\" Both friends were bewildered by the old man's sudden presence, but Neil decided to listen and asked, \\"And what exactly is that lesson, old man?\\" \\"Responsibility and accountability,\\" the sage answered with a knowing smile. \\"It's not about blaming one another. Instead, accept the consequences of your actions. Neil, your recklessness and negligence caused this accident. You must learn to be more cautious and make better choices in the future. And Derrick, though you tried to warn Neil, you also have the power to demand he slow down, even if it means stopping the car. Learn to act assertively when your well-being is at stake.\\" The old man's words resonated deeply with both Neil and Derrick. They realized that instead of finger-pointing and arguing over who should pay for the damages, they should focus on learning from their mistakes and taking responsibility for their actions. After a moment of contemplation, Neil sighed and looked at Derrick, \\"You're right; I shouldn't have driven so carelessly. I'll pay for the damages to your car, and I promise to be more cautious from now on.\\" Derrick nodded and replied, \\"I appreciate that, and I'll also try to be more assertive when I feel danger looms.\\" Epilogue Neil and Derrick managed to salvage their friendship from the wreckage of their unfortunate incident. They found a mechanic who agreed to repair Derrick's car for a fair price and the two friends, having grown wiser and more mature, went on several other adventures together, each time prioritizing safety and nurturing their bond. The old man was never seen again, but his wise words lingered in their minds, a constant reminder that sometimes, life had a funny way of teaching valuable lessons - and that friendship was indeed a cherished gift they were lucky to share."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a new situation: A geologist is examining rocks found in neighboring cities. City A recently experienced heavy rainfall for several weeks. Meanwhile, city B hasn't had a single rainy day in the same time span. But I can use this background: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. What is an answer for this question: Which city would have had less rock and soil material carried away by the rain? A:","completion":"City B would have had less rock and soil material carried away by the rain. Since City B hasn't experienced any rainfall in the given time span, there wouldn't have been any rainwater to react chemically with the soil and rock particles or to physically erode and transport the materials.

When he disappeared, Mama and I came back through the triple-bolted door that led from our apt in 1975 to our horsebarn in 1898. We returned to the dusty streets of New Jerusalem, and I had to keep on reminding myself that I was supposed to have been in France, and 'polly-voo' for my chums, and tell whoppers about the Eiffel Tower and the fancy bread and the snails and frogs we'd eaten. I was born in New Jerusalem, and raised there till I was ten. Then, one summer's day, my Pa sat me on his knee and told me we'd be going away for a while, that he had a new job.

But marketing gurus have been forced to 'straight-wash' 2013 British film Pride - so that it appeals to a wide US audience. The DVD cover of the movie, based on the campaign of a gay and lesbian activist group, has been altered - with any reference to the film's focal theme of homosexuality removed. Scroll down for video. Original version: In UK promotional material a banner reading 'lesbians and gays support the miners' is seen behind the marching crowd. In UK promotional material, a banner visible behind the marching crowd of campaigners appears to read: 'Lesbians and gays support the miners.' On the US version this banner has been digitally removed, and the synopsis has eradicated any hint of homosexuality - vaguely referring to the film's protagonists as 'London-based activists'. In Britain, this had been written as 'a London-based group of gay and lesbian activists'. The designers of the US DVD cover have been accused of putting the film back in the closet, with some critics dubbing the move a 'straight-washing'. 'Straight-washed': The DVD cover of the US release of Pride has digitally removed the banner reading 'gays and lesbians' while also deleting references to homosexuality in the synopsis. The film, aired in cinemas in September, is based on the true events of the LGBT activists who marched in solidarity with coal miners during their strike in 1984. The movie, which stars Imelda Staunton and Bill Nighy, was released on DVD in the US shortly before Christmas by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, after the rights to the film were bought by CBS Films. Ben Roberts, of the British Film Institute, told The Independent: 'I'm not surprised that the US distributors have taken a decision to sell more copies by watering down the gay content. 'I'm not defending it - it's wrong and outmoded - but I'm not surprised. 'It's an unfortunate commercial reality both here and in the US that distributors have to deal with. LGBT material is largely marginalised outside of rare hits like Brokeback Mountain.' Critically acclaimed: The movie, released in cinemas last year, starred Brits (L-R) Andrew Scott, Faye Marsay and Bill Nighly, pictured at the UK premiere in September. Gay author Matt Cain also criticised the move, saying it went against the spirit of the film. But Mr Cain, who is the former culture editor of Channel 4 News, said it will be a positive thing if it means more people buy the DVD and watch it. Pride was not a huge hit at the box office, but was plauded by critics and has already won a series of awards. In the US, it is nominated for a Golden Globe in the category of best comedy or musical film - with the ceremony taking place on Sunday. Slammed: Many people have taken to Twitter to criticise the decision to remove references to homosexuality on the DVD cover of Pride released to the US market.

The title itself, \\"Why did Hedrick Smith waste years of his life writing this?\\", poses a rhetorical question that implies the author's efforts in writing the book were futile and not worth the time invested. Furthermore, the review contains several negative remarks which help reinforce that it is not a positive review. For instance, the reviewer begins by mentioning that they have to read the book as part of their AP government class, implying that their engagement with the text was mandatory, not voluntary or out of personal interest. The reviewer proceeds to call the book \\"the worst thing\\" they have ever read, which is a strong and unambiguous statement of dislike. This expression of distaste is intensified by the reviewer's claim that the author, Smith, repeats his points excessively, making the reading experience \\"excruciating.\\" While the reviewer does concede that some of the stories included in the book are interesting, they clarify that this only applies to a minimal portion of the content. The remaining majority, as described by the reviewer, amounts to \\"about 700 pages\\" of \\"a complete waste of time.\\" In summary, this product review is not positive, as it predominantly expresses frustration, dissatisfaction, and disapproval of the book, with only a slight acknowledgment of some interesting aspects.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I know that the answer to the question \\"What caused it to be warmer then than it is now?\\" is in \\"During the Eocene (56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago), the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago.[citation needed]\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"During the Eocene epoch, which lasted from 56 million to 33.9 million years ago, the Earth experienced warmer temperatures than it does now. This warmth was due to the arrangement of continents and ocean currents at the time. Initially, Australia and Antarctica were connected, which allowed warm equatorial currents to mix with colder Antarctic waters. This circulated the heat around the world and maintained high global temperatures. However, when Australia separated from Antarctica around 45 million years ago, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away, leaving Antarctica isolated with a cold water channel between the two continents. As a result, the Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding the continent started to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes northward, reinforcing the cooling effect on the global climate. This shift marked the beginning of the present pattern of ice ages, which started roughly 40 million years ago. The changes in the Earth's continents, ocean currents, and climate systems contributed to the cooler temperatures we experience today in comparison to those during the Eocene epoch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Endeavour Launch Postponed Due to Heater Issues; Reschedule Expected on Monday The much-anticipated space shuttle Endeavour launch has been postponed today, and it seems unlikely that it will happen over the weekend. NASA has decided to delay the high-profile event to investigate problems with heaters in the shuttle's power system, according to MSNBC. Unfortunately, this provides no indication as to how the postponement will affect the day's most awaited spectator, the recovering Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Her husband, Mark Kelly, and the rest of the crew were less than four hours from liftoff when the news of the delay was delivered to them. NASA officials are currently working to assess the issues and determine how much time will be needed to address the heater failures. \\"They are trying to assess what all is going to be required and how much time we're going to need,\\" stated a NASA representative. \\"We still don't know what's wrong or why these multiple heater failures occurred.\\" Despite the postponement, the Associated Press reports that the next attempt is expected to take place on Monday at the earliest. Interestingly, President Barack Obama still plans to travel to Cape Canaveral for a tour of the facility, followed by a possible meeting with Giffords. This demonstrates the importance of the Endeavour mission and its impact on the American people, as well as the President's unwavering support for the space program. While delays in space shuttle launches are not uncommon, they serve as a reminder that safety is paramount in these high-stakes endeavors. With a crew of highly skilled astronauts and numerous scientific experiments on board, it is crucial that NASA takes the necessary precautions to ensure the mission's success. As suspense builds in the wait for the rescheduled launch, the world continues to hope for the best and that the heater issues will be resolved quickly and safely. In conclusion, the Endeavour launch postponement serves as a testament to the importance of safety and caution in space exploration. As we eagerly await the rescheduled liftoff, we are reminded of the dedication and hard work put forth by NASA and its astronauts to push the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Today I'm going to tell you a story about an important event in history. This exciting story is about a mountain called Taihang Mountain, and a train path called the Tao-tsin Railroad. Are you ready to learn something new? Let's get started! Once upon a time, there was a big and beautiful mountain named Taihang. This mountain had tall, strong cliffs and was covered in green trees, and it was a home for many animals. But there was something really special happening around this mountain, and that was the Tao-tsin Railroad. You see, the Tao-tsin Railroad was a very important train path for people and things to travel from one place to another. Trains are like big, long cars with many rooms that can travel on special tracks and take people far away quickly. So, this train path was super important for helping people in different places. Now, here's the exciting part! During a time called the Second Sino-Japanese War, some brave soldiers in China needed to do something very important. They needed to protect their people and their country by stopping the enemy from using the Tao-tsin Railroad to take things and hurt people. In order to do this, they had to clear the Taihang Mountain and cut the train path. This means they had to remove anything blocking the way and stop the trains from moving along the tracks. Do you know when they did this? It was in the month of September, in the year 1937. That's when these brave soldiers worked very hard and saved the day! So, little friend, the answer to your question is that the Taihang Mountain was cleared, and the Tao-tsin Railroad was cut in the month of September. Thanks to the bravery and hard work of those soldiers, many people and places were protected. And that's why we still remember this incredible story today! I hope you enjoyed this story, and maybe it even made you feel like a brave hero!

They looked into various folklore, legends, and even talked to people who claimed to have encountered unicorns. As Johnny and Dooley dove deeper into their research, they discovered that unicorns were often associated with purity, innocence, and enchantment. These creatures were believed to be elusive, magical beings that possessed healing properties and were only visible to those who possessed a pure heart. Many myths told of unicorns appearing in times of great need or danger, offering protection and guidance. Some even believed that unicorns were capable of granting wishes to those they deemed deserving. Although Johnny knew that unicorns were only creatures of legend, he appreciated Dooley's excitement and the positive influence these magical beings had on his friend's imagination. Determined to help Dooley meet a unicorn, he suggested they pay a visit to a nearby forest, known to be the home of several mysterious and unexplained sightings. The two friends ventured deep into the woods, carefully following the trails while keeping their eyes peeled for any signs of unicorns. They encountered a variety of other woodland animals like deer, squirrels, and foxes but no unicorns. As day turned into night, Dooley began to question the possibility of finding a unicorn and felt discouraged. Seeing Dooley's spirits waning, Johnny decided to take matters into his own hands. He covertly reached out to local artists and asked them to create a life-sized unicorn sculpture that could be placed in the forest for a short period. Johnny hoped this could serve as a suitable surprise for Dooley and help him forget about the elusive creatures they had not encountered. Once the unicorn sculpture was ready, Johnny secretly placed it at a clearing in the woods on a moonlit night. He excitedly ran back to Dooley and declared that they had a good chance of finding a unicorn that night. Filled with renewed hope, Dooley followed Johnny to the clearing where the majestic sculpture stood, bathed in silver moonlight. Dooley's eyes widened in wonder as he gazed upon the beautiful unicorn sculpture. It looked so real that for a moment, he truly believed he was in the presence of one of those magical creatures. Captured by its elegance, Dooley approached the sculpture, gently running his hands over the delicate lines and admiring the intricate details. A feeling of pure joy washed over Dooley as he stood beside the unicorn, lost in an enchanting world of his own creation. Johnny looked on, moved by his friend's happiness and proud of the surprise he had managed to pull off. In that moment, he knew he had given Dooley something to hold onto – a magical experience that would last a lifetime. Returning home from their adventure, Johnny and Dooley continued to revel in the excitement of their \\"unicorn encounter.\\" The magic of that night stayed with them, fueling their creativity and bond. Even though Dooley didn't meet a real unicorn, he was grateful to Johnny for making his dream come true in the most incredible way. And in the end, that was the most important part: the joy and happiness that they shared, and the memories they made in pursuit of the magical and mysterious."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For those of the Cardinal, Melanchthon, and Durer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Durer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach.

Yonge Street was fundamental in the original planning and settlement of western Upper Canada in the 1790s, informing the basis of the concession roads in Ontario today. Once the southernmost leg of Highway 11, linking the capital with northern Ontario, Yonge Street has been referred to as \\"Main Street Ontario\\". Today, no section of Yonge Street is a provincial highway. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada.
