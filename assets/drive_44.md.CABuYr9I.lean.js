Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Justin is conducting a chemical experiment involving sodium hydroxide. A key part of the reaction is ensuring that the sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water before adding the other materials. Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction A, and sets the heat to high. Justin can't use high heat for his second reaction, though, because the electricity supply is too weak to have both burners on high. Because of this, Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction B and sets the heat to low. But I can use this background: When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs What is an answer for this question: In which reaction will the sodium hydroxide dissolve faster? Answer:","completion":"The sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in reaction A. There are several factors that contribute to this outcome, as specified in the background information provided. In this case, the key determinant is the temperature at which the reactions are conducted. When Justin conducts reaction A, he sets the heat to high. By increasing the temperature, the molecules in the water gain more kinetic energy, which leads to more frequent and vigorous collisions between the sodium hydroxide and water molecules. As a result, the sodium hydroxide will dissolve more rapidly in reaction A. On the other hand, in reaction B, Justin is forced to set the heat to low due to limitations in the electricity supply. This lower temperature results in less kinetic energy for the water molecules, and therefore fewer and less vigorous collisions between sodium hydroxide and water molecules. Consequently, the sodium hydroxide will dissolve at a slower rate in reaction B compared to reaction A. The interplay between temperature and dissolution can be observed in everyday life, such as in the provided example of sugar dissolving in hot tea versus iced tea. In most cases, a solute (in this circumstance, sodium hydroxide) will dissolve at a quicker rate when the temperature of the solvent (water) is increased. In conclusion, the sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in reaction A due to the higher heat setting and consequently elevated water temperature, which facilitates more rapid dissolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dennis Wayne Johnson (September 18, 1954 - February 22, 2007), nicknamed \\"DJ\\", was an American professional basketball player for the National Basketball Association's (NBA) Seattle SuperSonics, Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics and coach of the Los Angeles Clippers. He was an alumnus of Dominguez High School, Los Angeles Harbor College and Pepperdine University. A prototypical late bloomer, Johnson overcame early struggles and had a successful NBA playing career. Drafted 29th overall in 1976 by the Seattle SuperSonics Dennis Wayne Johnson was born the eighth of sixteen children, to a social worker and a bricklayer who lived in Compton, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. Originally a baseball fan and a Little Leaguer, Johnson learned basketball from his father, but seemed to have neither the size nor the talent to compete with his peers: as a teenager at Dominguez High School, Johnson measured just 5'9\\" and played only \\"a minute or two each game\\". After high school, he worked several odd jobs, including a 2.75-per-hour job as a forklift driver, and played with his brothers in summer league games after work. During this period, Johnson grew to a height of 6'3\\", and developed what some later described as \\"rocket launcher legs\\", which enabled him to jump high to grab rebounds against taller opponents. Jim White, the coach at Los Angeles Harbor College, had watched Johnson play street basketball; feeling that Johnson excelled in defense, White asked him to enroll. Johnson gave up his jobs and developed into a promising young guard, averaging 18.3 points and 12.0 rebounds per game and leading Harbor to a college junior state title. However, the young guard lacked discipline, often clashed with White and was thrown off the team three times in two years. At the end of his junior college career, two universities offered Johnson scholarships: Azusa Pacific University and Pepperdine University. Johnson chose the latter, and in his only year there, he averaged 15.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game, and developed a reputation for tough defense. After that year, Johnson made himself eligible for the 1976 NBA draft, but was skeptical that any team would take him. NBA teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues, and Johnson was known to be a troublemaker.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The two most common formats for formal letters are block style and indented style. With block style, every part of the letter will be aligned with the left margin. Indented style requires that you indent the beginning of every paragraph, as well as the sender’s address, complimentary close, and the signature. The differences in these are largely a matter of preference; however, block style is more commonly used in business letters today. This can be either your home or business address, depending on whether the letter is sent on behalf of you personally or on behalf of your company. You should include your street address, city, state, and zip code, but you should not include your name. If you are writing your letter in block format, your address should be lined up with the left margin. If you are using indented format, start one tab right of the center margin. Phone numbers and email addresses are generally not included in the sender’s address, but they are acceptable. This should be the date that the letter was written. There should be a space between your address and the date, and 2 spaces between the date and the recipient’s address. Two spaces below the date, type the recipient’s name, including their courtesy title, such as Mr., Mrs., Ms., or Dr. Use the same courtesy title used in the salutation. Beneath the recipient’s name, include the full name of their company, if you are writing a business letter. For personal formal letters, you can omit the business name. Follow with the full address. As with the sender’s address, this should include the street address, city, state, and zip code. If your letter is addressed to a company or a specific department, you can include an attention line to direct the letter to a specific individual. This would come 2 spaces below the address and 2 spaces above the salutation. The salutation would be directed to the company or the department. The salutation is a greeting, and is likely the first thing your recipient will read. The salutation should be aligned with the left margin. Examples of salutations might include \\"Dear Mrs. Wells:\\" or \\"Dear Professor:\\" If you used the block format, your body, complimentary closing, and signature will all be aligned with the left margin. If you used indented format, the body will be left aligned with each paragraph indented, and the closing will be one tab left of the center, in line with the sender’s address. The complimentary close should be a phrase such as “Best regards” or “Thank you” and should be followed by a comma. Only the first word is capitalized.

Answer: It was the fifth- deadliest conflict in world history, subsequently paving the way for various political changes, such as revolutions in many of the nations involved. Question: who staRTED WORLD WAR I? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question \\"Who started World War I?\\", I will follow these steps: 1. Recall the main factors and events that led to the outbreak of World War I. 2. Identify the key players involved in the conflict's beginning. 3. Formulate an answer based on the gathered information. Step 1: Recalling the main factors and events that led to World War I World War I was a result of a complex web of factors, including nationalism, imperial ambitions, and militarism, among the European powers. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Serbian nationalist group Black Hand, in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, is considered the immediate trigger for the war. Step 2: Identifying the key players involved in the conflict's beginning While the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the immediate spark, multiple nations and alliances contributed to the tensions that eventually led to the war. The major players involved in the conflict included the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) and the Allied Powers (the United Kingdom, France, and Russia). Step 3: Formulating an answer based on the gathered information Based on the information gathered, it is not correct to attribute the start of World War I to a single nation or individual. It was the culmination of various factors, events, and the actions of multiple nations.

Write an article based on this summary: – As part of his recent bid to appeal to women, Mitt Romney deployed what he called an \\"amazing statistic,\\" saying that \\"92.3% of all the jobs lost during the Obama years have been lost by women.\\" If that made your eyebrows climb your forehead, you're not alone. The AP's fact checkers looked into the statement, and found that while it's technically true, it's also truly misleading. The recession began 13 months before Obama took office, and it initially hit men disproportionately hard. Male-dominated industries like construction and manufacturing are often hit first in recessions, and that was especially true this time. When Obama took office, women-dominated industries were catching up, and the number of unemployed women grew by 858,000 after January 2009—the basis of Romney's stat. But overall, men have lost 3.4 million jobs during the recession, to 1.8 million for women—which is why some economists have dubbed it the \\"man-cession.\\" CNN also notes that women began losing jobs in March 2008, well before Obama's inauguration. Article:","completion":"Title: The Reality Behind Romney's \\"Amazing Statistic\\" on Women's Job Losses During the Obama Years Mitt Romney, in a recent effort to appeal to women, stated that \\"92.3% of all the jobs lost during the Obama years have been lost by women.\\" This claim, which he dubbed an \\"amazing statistic,\\" has raised many eyebrows and triggered an investigation by AP's fact-checkers. Upon closer examination, it has been revealed that while this statistic is technically true, it is also highly misleading. The recession, which initially hit male-dominated industries like construction and manufacturing the hardest, began 13 months before President Obama took office. These sectors are usually the first to suffer during recessions, and this pattern held during the 2008 financial crisis. When Obama assumed the presidency, female-dominated industries were just beginning to feel the effects of the economic downturn, leading to an increase in the number of unemployed women. The basis for Romney's statement is that the number of unemployed women did, in fact, grow by 858,000 after January 2009. However, this number alone fails to provide a complete and accurate picture of the recession's impact on employment. When examining the overall toll of the recession on job losses, men have lost 3.4 million jobs compared to 1.8 million for women. This gender disparity in job loss is why some economists have referred to the 2008 recession as the \\"man-cession.\\" Furthermore, CNN has noted that women actually started losing jobs in March 2008, several months before Obama's inauguration, further discrediting the correlation between the Obama administration and the majority of women's job losses. In conclusion, while Mitt Romney's \\"amazing statistic\\" may be technically true, it is crucial for the public to understand that it is also highly misleading. The recession's impact on job loss must be examined holistically and in the context of the economic climate that the administration inherited. The reality is that both men and women have faced significant challenges in the job market during and following the 2008 recession, and pointing to a single statistic without acknowledging the broader context simply does not provide an accurate representation of the situation."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks. In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method.

Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level. But I can use this background: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content. What is an answer for this question: Which cousin experienced more temperature inversion phenomena?

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: If music makes you smarter and exercise helps you to think, surely exercising to music can turn you into an intelligent person. A team of scientists from Ohio State University did experiments on 33 volunteers who were getting better from heart disease following operation. They found that people who exercised while listening to Italian musician Antonio Vivaldi's \\"The Four Seasons\\" did much better on language ability tests than without music. \\"Facts suggest that exercise improves the learning ability of people with heart disease,\\" said the psychologist Charles Emery, who led the study. \\"And listening to music is thought to _ understanding. We just wanted to put the two results together,\\" he added. The volunteers said they felt better emotionally and physically after working out with or without the music. But their improvement on the test doubled after listening to music during exercise. Scientists have proved that music can be good for health, education and well-being. It helps reduce stress, sadness and nervousness; encourages relaxation or sleep; wakes up the body and improves memory and thoughts. In medical fields, music is used widely for patients who have had head hurts before and after operation. \\"The Four Seasons\\" was used because of its moderate tempo and positive results in earlier research. \\"Exercise seems to cause positive changes in the nervous system and these changes may have a direct result on learning ability,\\" Emery said. Scientists have been studying the results of music on understanding since the early 1950s. By 2000, psychologists were using Mozart's music, especially his violin pieces, to help children with speech disorders. Mozart was chosen because his music is not overexciting and has clear structures. A study showed students who listened to Mozart went on to score higher marks in an intelligence test. With important exams drawing near, your parents will not probably allow you to listen to music. But perhaps now you have good reasons to argue with them.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who pleaded for help from the Mongol prince? , can you please find it? When an ally of the Ü-Tsang ruler threatened destruction of the Gelugpas again, the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from the Mongol prince Güshi Khan (1582–1655), leader of the Khoshut (Qoshot) tribe of the Oirat Mongols, who was then on a pilgrimage to Lhasa. Güshi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637–1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpas' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo. Sonam Chöpel urged Güshi Khan to assault the Ü-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which Güshi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Gelug monks and supporters. In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the Ü-Tsang forces surrendered. Güshi Khan then captured and summarily executed Karma Tenkyong, the ruler of Ü-Tsang, King of Tibet.Soon after the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama. In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \\"supreme authority\\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually \\"expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokiteśvara through the performance of rituals,\\" by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies.

Royal assent In the United Kingdom, a bill is presented for royal assent after it has passed all the required stages in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the House of Commons may, under certain circumstances, direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the House of Lords. Officially, assent is granted by the sovereign or by Lords Commissioners authorised to act by letters patent.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a new situation: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. But I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. What is an answer for this question: Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Milly's plan? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Under Milly's plan, the number of animals is more likely to increase or at least stabilize compared to the current situation. Milly's approach focuses on reducing the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which is a crucial factor in mitigating the negative impacts of climate change and global warming. As mentioned in the background information, climate change and global warming, caused by human-made releases of greenhouse gases, are having adverse effects on the planet, its natural environment, and human existence. One significant consequence of this warming is the destruction of natural habitats, which leads to a reduction in wildlife population. By decreasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, Milly's plan would help slow down the rate of global warming, subsequently protecting and preserving natural habitats for animals. Ensuring the survival of these habitats is essential for maintaining and potentially increasing the population of wildlife species. This approach aligns with Mike's values, as it focuses on both saving the planet and preserving the animals that inhabit it. In summary, under Milly's plan, the number of animals is more likely to increase or stabilize due to her emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which would help address the critical issue of climate change and its detrimental effects on wildlife populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"and it fails and you're dead\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"You die because it fails.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"and it fails and you're dead,\\" the hypothesis \\"You die because it fails\\" appears to be true. However, to fully evaluate the validity of the hypothesis, we must delve into the relationship between the failure of \\"it\\" and the subsequent death of the individual in question and examine if there is a causal relationship between the two events. The premise itself establishes that two events occur in succession - the failure and the resulting death. To be more specific, \\"it fails\\" should be the cause and \\"you're dead\\" should be the effect. In this context, the hypothesis \\"You die because it fails\\" is asserting the following causal relationship: 1. If \\"it\\" fails, then you die. 2. \\"It\\" does indeed fail. 3. Therefore, you die. By presenting these points, the hypothesis affirms the causal relationship between the two events. However, it's crucial to consider other factors that might affect the validity of the hypothesis in different contexts or scenarios. For instance, consider the context that \\"it\\" refers to a medical treatment or procedure. In this case, the hypothesis might be valid if the failure of the treatment or procedure directly leads to the person's death. However, if the person would have died regardless of whether the treatment or procedure was successful or not, the causal relationship might not hold, and the hypothesis could be false. Additionally, the hypothesis could be deemed true in a more general sense, without directly implying a cause-and-effect relationship. In other words, the premise could be interpreted as stating that when \\"it\\" fails (whatever \\"it\\" is), death follows, but this might not mean that \\"it\\" failing is the immediate or direct cause. It could be that a series of other events or factors lead to the individual's death, though the failure of \\"it\\" is simply associated with those events or factors. In such a situation, we can still assert that the hypothesis is true, albeit with more nuance. Ultimately, based on the given premise, \\"and it fails and you're dead,\\" the hypothesis \\"You die because it fails\\" generally appears to be true, bearing in mind the assumption of a causal relationship between the two events. This conclusion is supported by the premise's sequential presentation of the events and the understanding that the failure in question is presumably a determinant factor in the person's death. Nonetheless, the validity of the hypothesis may fluctuate depending on the contextual interpretation and the exploration of other contributing factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The expedition's scientific staff included Arne Skjolsvold, Carlyle Smith, Edwin Ferdon, Gonzalo Figueroa and William Mulloy. Heyerdahl and the professional archaeologists who travelled with him spent several months on Rapa Nui investigating several important archaeological sites. Highlights of the project include experiments in the carving, transport and erection of the notable moai, as well as excavations at such prominent sites as Orongo and Poike. The expedition published two large volumes of scientific reports (Reports of the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition to Easter Island and the East Pacific) and Heyerdahl later added a third (The Art of Easter Island). Heyerdahl's popular book on the subject, Aku-Aku was another international best-seller. In Easter Island: The Mystery Solved (Random House, 1989), Heyerdahl offered a more detailed theory of the island's history. Based on native testimony and archaeological research, he claimed the island was originally colonized by Hanau eepe (\\"Long Ears\\"), from South America, and that Polynesian Hanau momoko (\\"Short Ears\\") arrived only in the mid-16th century; they may have come independently or perhaps were imported as workers. According to Heyerdahl, something happened between Admiral Roggeveen's discovery of the island in 1722 and James Cook's visit in 1774; while Roggeveen encountered white, Indian, and Polynesian people living in relative harmony and prosperity, Cook encountered a much smaller population consisting mainly of Polynesians and living in privation. Heyerdahl notes the oral tradition of an uprising of \\"Short Ears\\" against the ruling \\"Long Ears\\". The \\"Long Ears\\" dug a defensive moat on the eastern end of the island and filled it with kindling. During the uprising, Heyerdahl claimed, the \\"Long Ears\\" ignited their moat and retreated behind it, but the \\"Short Ears\\" found a way around it, came up from behind, and pushed all but two of the \\"Long Ears\\" into the fire. This moat was found by the Norwegian expedition and it was partly cut down into the rock. Layers of fire were revealed but no fragments of bodies. As for the origin of the people of Easter Island, DNA tests have shown a connection to South America, critics conjecture that this was a result of recent events, but whether this is inherited from a person coming in later times is hard to know. If the story that (almost) all Long Ears were killed in a civil war is true, as the islanders story goes, it would be expected that the statue-building South American bloodline would have been nearly utterly destroyed, leaving for the most part the invading Polynesian bloodline.

Sentence: The United States Air Force currently has 465 troop carrier groups.","completion":"After analyzing the given text and researching the current state of United States Air Force, it is clear that the sentence stating \\"The United States Air Force currently has 465 troop carrier groups\\" is not true. The text provides information about the 464th Troop Carrier Group, specifying that it was operational during the Cold War era under the Tactical Air Command between 1953 and 1957, utilizing Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar and Fairchild C-123 Provider aircraft. However, the text does not mention the current state or number of troop carrier groups in the United States Air Force. In reality, the organizational structure of the United States Air Force since the Cold War has gone through significant changes. The Air Force has consolidated, inactivated, and reorganized several units, transitioning from the concept of Troop Carrier Groups to different titles and responsibilities, such as Airlift or Air Mobility Wings and Squadrons, which focus on delivering personnel, cargo, and other essential support in various operations. A precise number of troop carrier groups or airlift squadrons might vary based on the ongoing organizational structure, modernization, or changes in the strategic context of the United States Air Force. However, it is highly unlikely that there are currently 465 troop carrier groups in the United States Air Force. In conclusion, based on the information provided and the current structure of the United States Air Force, the sentence claiming that there are currently 465 troop carrier groups is incorrect as the organization has evolved since the Cold War, and the concept of troop carrier groups is no longer in use as it once was."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Manchester City demolished by Bayern Munich rulers of the middle ground Bayern Munich's influential midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger powers in a free-kick during the Champions League game against Manchester City at the Etihad. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian Well, there's something you don't see every day. If there were some chastening lessons for Manchester City in the course of one of the more overwhelming 3-1 home defeats you are likely to see, there is perhaps some consolation in both the extent and the nature of Bayern's superiority in a decisive opening hour. Frankly there were lessons here for everyone as Bayern produced an alluringly controlled exhibition of football from the near-future, tactically and technically beyond the reach of City's Champions League work-in-progress, despite a spirited late rally. It was a pointed kind of superiority too. There were those who questioned what Pep Guardiola could do to refine this team, but the answer was here in flashes. Bayern's midfield, headed by Thomas Müller in a roving lone striker role, was irresistible at times. This was Bayern, but a little more so, Bayern with added swarm. If the success under Jupp Heynckes was based around the imposing rhythms of that thrummingly high-spec midfield, this was never likely to be diluted under Guardiola, who in his wonder years at Barcelona finessed the idea that football is now a sport of midfielders, the best teams comprised almost entirely of a collection of strolling mini-generals. This is the thing about this Bayern team: they do not just want to score more goals than you, they want to out-run and out-pass you through the centre of the pitch. The opposition are not simply beaten: they are Bayerned – and City were at times entirely Bayerned as for long periods the German champions played a de facto eight-man midfield, with both full-backs imperiously pushed on and the revolving bank of red shirts pushed right up on to City's defence. It is a relentless style City themselves have employed successfully at times, most recently in this stadium against Manchester United. With that memory still fresh the contrast was stark here as Bayern's midfield did to City's midfield what City's midfield had done to United's, depriving them of the ball, moving into space with a fearsomely well-grooved sense of purpose, and generally out-muscling a midfield that had looked pretty much un-musclable against the English champions two weeks ago. This was City's fate in the first half, with Yaya Touré in particular bypassed. Touré remains a coveted presence in the Premier League, a great clanking Iron Man of a midfielder, whether employed in his galloping forward-destroyer mode or as a box-to-box all-rounder. Here was an opportunity for the Premier League's own Gulliver to stand up to the Bayern machine, and perhaps to prey on a slightly less tigerish midfield deprived of Javi Martinez. Fat chance. It was startling to see the Ivorian so obviously uncomfortable, lurching sideways in search of the ball, repeatedly harried in possession and outmanoeuvred by Philipp Lahm, who was again exceptional in his converted central role. Plus, of course, there was a Guardiola-flavoured surprise further forward as Müller – attacking midfielder, scruffy-haired wanderer and self-coined \\"Space Investigator\\" – played as a central striker. Albeit, as ever with Müller this was a quirkily nuanced version, some way short of the flailing medieval target-man more familiar on these shores, and not quite a false nine either. At first Müller dropped deep, wandering on to the flanks and at times simply mooching around in an offside position, skinny-legged and awkward, like a jogger accidentally strayed on to the pitch. Later, though, he produced some moments of classy orthodox centre-forward play, emerging as the outstanding player on the pitch and, as ever, a standard bearer for brain over brawn at the highest level. It was one of Müller's sudden bursts of activity that helped to create the space that led to Bayern's first goal. With Gaël Clichy drawn inside by Müller's spin, Rafinha had time to find Franck Ribéry with a crossfield pass. His shot was well struck but Hart should have saved it. Bayern don't need a goal's start, but here they were presented with a floppy-wristed goalkeeping welcome basket. City drew breath amid a familiar sense of red-shirted suffocation, accompanied, as if to rub it in, by repeated chidings from Guardiola on the sidelines, Bayern's manager demanding an ever higher passing tempo, a more palpable sense of supremacy. To their credit City resisted, gaining something of a foothold in the match either side of half time and pulling a goal back near the end though Alvaro Negredo. It was Müller who killed the game on 56 minutes with a horribly simple goal. On this occasion it was the space between Clichy's ears that the Raumdeuter chose to investigate, making a diagonal run past City's left-back, who simply watched him go, and nudging the simplest of long passes past Hart and into the net. For City there was no disgrace in losing to a Bayern team who may or may not retain their European crown, but who looked at the Etihad like champions whose strengths have, if anything, been sharpened and refined.

The 10th had held the center position between the two hills and when they went forward they split toward the tops of the two hills. Lieutenant Ord started the regulars forward on the American left and Roosevelt claimed he started the charge on the right. Retreating Spanish troops withdrew toward San Juan Hill still being contested. The regulars fired toward them and supported their comrades fighting on the adjacent hill.

The statement assesses and criticizes various elements of what is presumably a movie or visual work related to the vampire and dead-undead genre. Here's a breakdown and analysis of the negative aspects identified in the sentence: 1. \\"rymer does n't trust laughs\\": The mention of Rymer not trusting laughs could suggest a lack of faith in the comedic moments of the work, which has a negative connotation. It indicates that the creator may not have effectively incorporated humor into the project. 2. \\"does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre\\": This part of the sentence highlights that the creator failed to show respect or acknowledge the specific tastes and preferences of the target audience – followers of the dead-undead genre. The usage of \\"proper respect\\" indicates that the creator did not meet the expected standard or treatment for this category of followers. 3. \\"who deserve more from a vampire pic\\": The statement further emphasizes the disappointment of the target audience. It expresses a sense of injustice to the followers of the genre, implying that they have certain standards and expectations for vampire-themed works which the creator did not meet. The usage of \\"deserve more\\" conveys the feeling that the viewers' preferences have not been adequately taken into consideration. 4. \\"than a few shrieky special effects\\": This negative sentiment relates to the quality of the special effects within the work. \\"Shrieky\\" special effects can be associated with cheap, low-quality, or unsophisticated visuals or audio elements. The statement emphasizes that the followers of the genre expect more depth and substance than just some poorly-executed effects. In conclusion, the sentiment of the provided sentence is predominantly negative. It criticizes the creator (Rymer) for not trusting laughs, lacking proper respect for the followers of the genre, not catering to the expectations of the target audience, and relying on poorly-done special effects.

Since it is not explicitly positive or negative, we can consider this to be a neutral sentiment. 2. \\"then\\": This word is used to indicate a sequence of events or a plan. This is essential in understanding the structure of the tweet but doesn't convey any sentiment on its own, so we can characterize this as neutral as well. 3. \\"hopefully\\": The use of \\"hopefully\\" implies that the next part of the tweet is something that the user is looking forward to or wishes to happen. This word adds a sense of optimism, anticipation, or positivity to the sentiment. It shows that the user is positively inclined towards the upcoming event or scenario, which contributes to a positive sentiment. 4. \\"a nap\\": This phrase is the subject of the user's hope. Naps are typically considered as restful and rejuvenating experiences, and since the user is looking forward to taking a nap, this part of the tweet has a positive sentiment as well. Napping usually indicates a break or a moment of self-care, which is seen as a positive act for personal wellbeing. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet is a mix of neutral, positive, and anticipatory emotions. The neutral sentiment comes from the task or process-related portion of the tweet, while the positive sentiment arises from the user's hope for a nap. The anticipatory emotion, which is an important part of the overall sentiment, is derived from the user's use of the word \\"hopefully\\" and their expectation of enjoying a restful nap."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dear Carolyn: What if the person you need to forgive is yourself? I bullied my younger sister as a kid/teen, and as a grown 30-something I feel incredible shame and guilt. I have apologized to her as an adult, which she seemed to have accepted, and I know much of it stemmed from being bullied and abused throughout those years myself. However, I can’t seem to get past how I contributed to a lousy childhood for my sister — someone for whom I would now do anything and who will barely speak to me and the rest of our family. Carolyn Hax started her advice column in 1997, after five years as a copy editor and news editor in Style and none as a therapist. The column includes cartoons by \\"relationship cartoonist\\" Nick Galifianakis -- Carolyn's ex-husband -- and appears in over 200 newspapers. I know that now I would make different choices but can’t undo the past. How do I forgive myself? Seeking Forgiveness: I think this weight you’re carrying, the painful awareness of your past behavior, is proof you’ve grown into a decent, empathetic person. It hurts, like flipping on an overhead light first thing in the morning. But it’s still important and good. When going back and fixing something isn’t possible, or when you’ve apologized and still don’t feel better, then I think all any of us can do is make a conscious effort to be good. It’s not so much “paying it forward,” since that’s about returning favors to strangers — call it “fixing it forward.” Do also remain in regular, arm’s-length contact with your sister — every few months, noting birthdays or Christmas or milestones, for example, with respectful personal notes. Not often enough to crowd her, but enough to let her know that she’s welcome if she’s ever ready to come to you. Dear Carolyn: My mom is a lifelong chain-smoker. No chance of getting her to quit: She loves everything about it, and the mental gymnastics she will go through to justify it would be funny if they weren’t so sad. She even gave my uncle, who had a portion of a lung removed and is in chemo to combat lung cancer, a cigarette last weekend because, “Well, he wanted one and it made him so happy!” The issue: We are renting a house in a tropical location in a few weeks and she is the only smoker out of 10 people. I am considering asking her to use an e-cigarette while we’re there. Do you have any suggestions on making this request more successful? She genuinely doesn’t care about other people’s health or comfort in this department. She found a “study” once on the Internet that said smoking did not actually cause cancer. The group we’re going with is, uh, volatile enough without the stress of a nonstop cloud of stink and the hacking cough that accompanies my mom everywhere. Vacationer: I hope the house is nonsmoking, per the lease. “She genuinely doesn’t care” plus belief that smoking isn’t a health hazard equals no, there is no other way to get a message through to this person. Unless you’re prepared to set out conditions — either e-smoke or outside — and exclude her from the trip if she refuses to agree to them. Fingers crossed that it doesn’t rain.

Tehran not only blocked access to a site the inspectors believe could have been used for tests on how to produce a nuclear weapon, they reported, but it also refused to agree to a process for resolving questions about other “possible military dimensions” to its nuclear program. The announcement came in a terse press release from the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations agency, which said its inspection team had left the country. The agency is expected to release its latest report on the status of Iran’s program in the next week. The inspectors’ previous visit to Iran ended several weeks ago with no agreement other than to meet this week. Iran’s refusal to deal with the inspectors’ questions is likely to increase tension, at a moment of heightened sanctions and after the assassination of nuclear scientists in Iran and suspected retaliation against Israeli diplomats. Iran struck an increasingly bellicose tone on Tuesday, with an Iranian official warning that the country would take pre-emptive action against perceived foes if it felt its national interests were threatened. The country also laid down new conditions for oil sales. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Iran also indicated in recent days, however, that it was willing to resume negotiations over its nuclear program, but it was unclear under what terms. ||||| CAIRO — China, Russia and Iran all made declarations of support for the Syrian government on Tuesday, reaffirming their alliances in the face of broad, intense international lobbying for unity against President Bashar al-Assad as his nearly yearlong crackdown on domestic opponents has sharpened against restive areas. The worst violence on Tuesday was reported in the central city of Homs, which has been under sustained assault for more than two weeks. The day’s toll of that city’s residents, as compiled by various groups that try to track the violence from inside and outside the country, ranged from 16 to more than 40 killed. At the same time, the faction of the opposition that is armed has claimed several more lives, according to the Syrian government, whose news agency reported the funerals of three soldiers killed in or near Damascus and in the city of Hama, to the north. Russia announced that it would not participate in a meeting in Tunisia on Friday of a contact group of Western and Arab nations, Friends of Syria, where opposition figures were expected to lobby for greater international recognition and support. The Syrian government’s news agency, SANA, reported that a Chinese special envoy to the Middle East, Wu Sike, visited Damascus on Tuesday and called for dialogue with all sides in the crisis. SANA also reported from Beijing on a news conference by the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Li, in which he called for “the international community to respect the sovereignty, stability and unity of Syria.” Mr. Li did not say whether China would attend the Friends of Syria conference. Iranian officials, at a regular foreign ministry news conference in Tehran, did not explicitly discuss the conference, but denounced Western meddling in the affairs of its longstanding ally as benefiting Israel at the expense of those who resist its power. “What is happening in Syria serves the best interests of Israel and weakens the resistance,” said a ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, as quoted by SANA. But the United States threw some of the Iranian’s support for Syria into question, suggesting that Iran’s reports that it has sent two warships to help train Syrian forces were false. “We have absolutely no indication whatsoever the Iranian ships ever docked in Syrian ports,” a Pentagon spokesman, George Little, was quoted by Reuters as saying. Iran’s Press TV satellite broadcaster had said the two ships, a destroyer and a supply ship, docked in Tartus on Saturday “to provide maritime training to naval forces of Syria under an agreement signed between Tehran and Damascus a year ago.” Red Cross officials did not respond to calls on Tuesday seeking to establish whether the organization’s efforts to secure even a brief ceasefire from government forces had been successful. But based on reports from activist groups and official Syrian media, the violence appeared unabated. Foreign journalists are generally not allowed in Syria, so such reports cannot be verified. The assault on Homs appeared to be a continuation of the government attack on the city that began Feb. 4, after China and Russia vetoed a resolution condemning the violence and backing an Arab League plan for Mr. Assad to step aside. (Last week, in the strongest international rebuke to date, the General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to pass the same resolution in nonbinding form.) A new Cairo-based group, the Activist News Association, has been collecting information from a network of “citizen journalist” contacts inside of Syria. Rami Jarrah, a Syrian activist who helped create the group, said that Syrian government and ground forces were massing outside of Homs. “Active resistance has long since stopped but the government is using the excuse of ‘armed resistance’, in quotes, to continue this bombardment,” Mr. Jarrah said. “They’re killing the democratic movement.” Based on photographs of victims sent from inside Syria, he said, at least 79 deaths took place around the country on Tuesday, 46 of them in Homs, where shelling of the Sunni Arab neighborhood of Baba Amr was particularly heavy, and 33 in Idlib to the north. That toll was likely to rise, he said. Another exile activist group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported that in the northern city of Aleppo, unknown gunmen shot and killed Mohammad Ramadan, a businessman who supported the government. It also reported scattered protests and skirmishing in the capital, Damascus, where a group of youths raised an opposition flag at the Al-Jaawzeh Bridge at the southern entrance of the capital, the London-based Observatory said. Meanwhile, the Hamas authorities in the Gaza Strip allowed Palestinians to demonstrate against Mr. Assad for the first time, a move that came weeks after the top Hamas leadership abandoned its longtime base in Damascus. The unusual rally was organized by a group called the Palestinian Gathering to Support Syrian People, a new body run by the sons of late Hamas leaders from Gaza. About 200 students rallied at Islamic University before marching with Palestinian and Syrian flags to downtown Gaza. There, some 100 more Palestinians joined the rally, including women. The protesters burned posters of Mr. Assad and carried banners bearing slogans like “Allah, Syria and Freedom,” and “Shame on Child Murderers.” The Hamas leadership has refused to express support for Mr. Assad despite pressure from Iran, a main backer of Hamas. But with some 650,000 Palestinian refugees living inside Syria, Hamas officials are unlikely to draw Syrian ire by openly criticizing the leadership. ||||| A:","completion":"Summary 1: International nuclear inspectors faced failure in their visit to Iran, where Tehran blocked access to a site believed to be used for nuclear weapon testing and refused to agree on a process to resolve questions about other possible military dimensions of its nuclear program.

Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Working exclusively in short films, he has produced almost forty works since 1937, nine of which have been grouped together as the \\"Magick Lantern Cycle\\". His films variously merge surrealism with homoeroticism and the occult, and have been described as containing \\"elements of erotica, documentary, psychodrama, and spectacle\\". Anger himself has been described as \\"one of America's first openly gay filmmakers, and certainly the first whose work addressed homosexuality in an undisguised, self-implicating manner\\", and his \\"role in rendering gay culture visible within American cinema, commercial or otherwise, is impossible to overestimate\\", with several being released prior to the legalization of homosexuality in the United States. For twenty years from the early 1980s, Anger released no new material. In 2000, at the dawn of the new millennium, Anger began screening a new short film, the anti-smoking Don't Smoke That Cigarette, followed a year later by The Man We Want to Hang, which comprised images of Aleister Crowley's paintings that had been exhibited at a temporary exhibition in Bloomsbury, London. In 2004, he began showing Anger Sees Red, a short surrealistic film starring himself, and the same year also began showing another work, Patriotic Penis. He soon followed this with a flurry of other shorts, including Mouse Heaven, which consisted of images of Mickey Mouse memorabilia, Ich Will! and Uniform Attraction, all of which he showed at various public appearances. Anger's most recent project has been the Technicolor Skull with musician Brian Butler, described as a \\"magick ritual of light and sound in the context of a live performance\\", in which Anger plays the theremin, and Butler plays the guitar and other electronic instruments, behind a psychedelic backdrop of colors and skulls. Anger makes an appearance in the 2008 feature documentary by Nik Sheehan about Brion Gysin and the Dreamachine titled FLicKeR. Anger also appears alongside Vincent Gallo in the 2009 short film \\"Night of Pan\\" written and directed by Brian Butler. In 2009 his work was featured in a retrospective exhibition at the MoMA PS1 in New York City, and the following year a similar exhibition took place in London. Anger has finished writing Hollywood Babylon III, but has not yet published it, fearing severe legal repercussions if he did so. Of this he has stated that \\"The main reason I didn't bring it out was that I had a whole section on Tom Cruise and the Scientologists. I'm not a friend of the Scientologists.\\" Despite withholding legal action against the highly critical 2015 film Going Clear, the Church of Scientology was known on earlier occasions to heavily sue those making accusations against them.

Loanee Lex Immers, making his first Cardiff start, restored their lead before Whittingham's stunning free-kick made the points safe. Harry Bunn smashed in a consolation for the hosts in second-half stoppage time. Defeat brought the Terriers' five-match unbeaten home run in all competitions to an end. Whittingham's opener brought the game time to life as he swept home Anthony Pilkington's cut-back, before Wells' low effort made it 1-1 before half-time.

Whittingham sealed the win direct from a free-kick with a superb finish, before Wells fed Bunn to give the Bluebirds a late scare in the closing stages, but the Welsh side held on. Huddersfield, who were without suspended defensive duo Mark Hudson and Tommy Smith, struggled to create openings and remain 17th in the Championship.

Thanks to misguided laws, they can't be refinanced and the debt can't be shed through bankruptcy. To make matters worse, the government uses an \\"army of private debt collectors\\" to harass student borrowers without relief. \\"How do we quit loading up 18-year-olds with a risky gamble that could impact the rest of their lives?\\" Some interesting proposals are out there, including one to refinance student loans at 4% and another that would link the amount students have to pay back to their income. \\"Ultimately, keeping college affordable is the answer,\\" writes Dayen, and Katrina vanden Heuvel at the Washington Post hits on a similar theme today. \\"This isn’t complicated,\\" she writes. \\"Washington should be moving boldly to make advanced education affordable for all. The federal government should be increasing grants to states for public colleges, on the condition that the states increase their own contributions and act to curb college costs.\\" Cracking down on shady for-profit colleges also would help. Plenty can be done, and vanden Heuvel writes that she hopes \\"student loans may be to this generation what the draft was to the boomers—the government folly that afflicts them personally and rouses them to act.\\" Click for her full column, or for Dayen's full column. Expand this summary.","completion":"This passage touches on a significant issue plaguing the United States today: the student debt crisis. The author, David Dayen, postulates in his Salon article that student loans have become a crushing burden for many, citing their uniqueness as a form of debt that cannot be refinanced or discharged in bankruptcy. This is largely due to laws that he labels as ill-conceived. Adding to the onerous nature of student loans is the aggressive activity of private debt collecters employed by the government to hound the borrowers without providing any relief. So, what can be done to remedy this issue? The author poses the question as a form of challenge: how can we halt the trend of burying young adults, just starting out in life, under a mountain of debt that poses a risky gamble with the potential to negatively affect their entire lives? Thankfully, there are several interesting strategies mooted to deal with the problem, including a proposal to refinance the student loans at a lower interest rate of 4%, and another to adjust the repayment amount in line with the borrower's income. The ultimate solution according to Dayen, however, is to ensure that college remains affordable for the majority. Pursuing the theme of affordable education, Katrina vanden Heuvel of the Washington Post asserts in her piece that the situation doesn't require a complex solution. She advocates for strong action from Washington to make higher education accessible for everyone. One such action she suggests is for the federal government to increase its grants to state-run institutions, while demanding states to contribute more and introduce measures to stifle the soaring cost of college. Vanden Heuvel also shows a strong position against fraudulent for-profit colleges, advocating for stricter regulations on these institutions. Despite the severity of the problem, there is still hope. Van den Heuvel draws parallels with the draft experienced by the baby boomer generation, expressing her hope that the student loan issue could be the defining problem of the current generation leading them to take action. She encourages readers to delve more into this issue by reading her detailed column and the one penned by Dayen. In conclusion, both authors stress the importance of various measures to alleviate the student debt burden. They argue for the need to keep college affordable, the significance of appropriate student loan policies, and suggest that aggressive measures need to be taken against dubious for-profit colleges. They evoke the image of a motivated, socially-conscious generation taking the initiative to create a future where higher education is universally accessible, and not financially crippling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An American scientist claims that your personality might determine whether you like spicy food like chillis. An American scientist claims that your personality might determine whether you like spicy food. Pennsylvania State University's research examined the link between peoples' personality types and whether they were fans of food packed full of hot spices such as chilli. It found that people who seek adventure and intense sensations like spicy food more than those who avoid risky situations. Nadia Byrnes, a doctoral candidate at the university, conducted a study of 184 non-smoking participants between the ages of 18 and 45 without any known issues that would compromise their ability to taste. The group of people were primarily Caucasian and around 63 per cent were female. She assessed the group using the Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking (AISS) test. This test looks at the personality trait of 'sensation-seeking'. This trait is defined as seeking out 'novel and intense stimulation' regardless of the risks involved. People who score above the mean AISS score are considered more open to risks and new experiences, while those scoring below the mean are considered less open to those things. The subjects were then given 25 micrometers of capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, and asked to rate how much they liked a spicy meal as the burn from the capsaicin increased in intensity. Those in the group who fell below the mean AISS rapidly disliked the meal as the burn increased. Pennsylvania State University's research examined the link between peoples' personality types and whether they were fans of food packed full of hot spices including chill, which is found in lots of curries (pictured) People who were above the mean AISS had a consistently liked the meal even as the burn increased. Those in the mean group liked the meal less as the burn increased, but not nearly as rapidly as those below the mean. Ms Byrnes said: 'Theoretically, we know that burn intensity and liking are linear related. The more irritating a compound or food gets, the less people should like it. 'But that's not always the case.' She presented her findings at the 2013 Institute of Food Technologists annual meeting and food expo. People were given 25 micrometers of capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, and asked to rate how much they liked a spicy meal as the burn from the capsaicin increased in intensity. The research found that people who actively seek adventure and intense sensations, like spicy food more than those who avoid risky situations. At the same event, Dr Shane McDonald, principal flavor chemist at Kalsec, discussed the addition of 'tingling' spices to foods. The practice is not very prevalent in the U.S. diet outside of carbonation. He said that 'Ma La,' a traditional Szechuan cuisine that combines chili peppers for their heat and Szechuan peppers for their tingle, shows promise for American food manufacturers. The combination of the two sensates enhances the tingling while reducing the heat, which could make certain traditionally spicy foods more appealing to consumers, he said.

The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos Gonzalez. They named the group after the homonymous members' club in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzon, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, many of whom had been retired for years. The first performances by the full line up of Buena Vista Social Club, including Cooder, were those filmed by Wenders in Amsterdam and New York. Other international shows and T.V. appearances soon followed with varying line ups. Ibrahim Ferrer and Ruben Gonzalez performed together in Los Angeles in 1998 to an audience that included Alanis Morissette, Sean Combs, and Jennifer Lopez, Ferrer dedicating the song Mami Me Gusto to the Hispanic Lopez. Performances in Florida, which has a large Cuban exile and Cuban American community, were rare after the release of the film due to the political climate. In the late 1990s, a concert by Cuban jazz pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba turned into a near riot when concert goers were attacked and spat at by protesters opposed to the Cuban government. When \\"Buena Vista\\" musicians played for a music industry conference at Miami Beach in 1998, hundreds of protesters chanted outside and the convention center hall was cleared briefly because of a bomb threat. In 1999, Ferrer and Ruben Gonzalez were forced to cancel Miami shows citing fears for their safety after fellow-Cubans Los Van Van drew 4,000 protesters at a previous show, and Compay Segundo was forced to cut short a 1999 Miami performance due to another bomb threat. When touring the U.S., the Cubans are only entitled to their per diem (transportation and lodging) and are not permitted performance fees due to the U.S. embargo. In 2001 a Buena Vista Social Club (with Ibrahim Ferrer) performance was recorded in Austin for PBS and broadcast on Austin City Limits in 2002. Buena Vista Social Club continue to tour throughout the world as Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club, and despite the deaths of six of the original members, the collective performs with many of the remaining ensemble members including Barbarito Torres and \\"Guajiro\\" Mirabal. Ry Cooder's guitar parts are handled by Manuel Galban, a former member of Cuban vocal group Los Zafiros, who played on Ibrahim Ferrer's first solo record with Cooder and appeared in Wim Wenders' film. Following a 2007 performance in London, a reviewer at The Independent described the ensemble as \\"something of an anomaly in music business terms, due to their changing line-up and the fact that they've never really had one defining front person\\", adding, \\"It's hard to know what to expect from what is more of a brand than a band.\\" Where did they tour?","completion":"The Buena Vista Social Club began touring internationally after the release of their debut album in 1997.

Some notable performances took place in Los Angeles in 1998, with Ibrahim Ferrer and Ruben Gonzalez playing to an audience that included celebrities such as Alanis Morissette, Sean Combs, and Jennifer Lopez. However, their performances in Florida were rare due to the political climate surrounding Cuban artists. In the late 1990s, several concerts in Miami were either canceled or cut short because of protests and bomb threats against the Cuban performers. The ensemble continued to tour worldwide, even after the passing of some original members, as the Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club. Some of the countries and cities they performed in include various locations in Europe, such as London, and in the United States, with a notable performance recorded in Austin for PBS in 2001 and broadcast on Austin City Limits in 2002.

The Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, have won five Wimbledon singles titles each and face each other for the first time in six years. Of their five previous meetings at SW19, four have been in the final. Nine Grand Slam winners are in action, including Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Stan Wawrinka and Maria Sharapova, so it is set to be one of the most exciting days of an already thrilling championships. The first match on Centre Court sees the Williams sisters do battle at SW19 yet again. There must have been times when elder sibling Venus doubted if she would face her sister for a sixth time at Wimbledon, and a 26th time in total. Diagnosed with auto-immune disease, Sjogren's syndrome, Venus has battled her way back to fitness and rediscovered her form over the last 18 months. As a result, Serena thinks her sister will have the support of the crowd. \\"I would be rooting for Venus,\\" she said. \\"She's been through so much; she's just an incredible individual\\". Serena's bid to win her 21st Grand Slam title and her fourth in succession suffered a scare at the hands of Heather Watson..

Karlovic questioned the integrity of Wimbledon after he was foot-faulted 11 times and accused officials of favouring the home player and said he felt \\"cheated\\". \\"It was outrageous, outrageous,\\" he said. \\"It's Wimbledon, Centre Court, and they do this. The whole credibility of this tournament went down for me.\\" There was a sense of inevitability that Murray would be the last home hope left in the second round, but on the whole it has been a good Wimbledon for British tennis with more than half of the entrants making it through the first round. \\"Make no mistake, Andy Murray faces a very difficult match against Ivo Karlovic.

The incident, which highlights the inherent danger and unpredictability of military aviation, saw both pilots managing to eject safely before the aircraft was completely destroyed. The fighter jet in question, a state-of-the-art Sukhoi Su-30 developed by Russia's premier aircraft manufacturer, Sukhoi Corporation, is one of the most advanced and efficient combat aircraft produced by the country. The twin-engine, two-seat jet boasts a host of technologically sophisticated features and impressive maneuverability, and is regarded as a major player within the global arena of multi-role fighter aircraft. The fateful incident took place in a secluded area during the early hours of the day, with preliminary reports suggesting that the pilots were conducting a standard military exercise. Upon encountering unexpected complications, the skilled aviators adhered to protocol and made the critical decision to abort the mission, subsequently ejecting themselves from the cockpit using the aircraft's inbuilt K-36DM ejection seats. Fortunately, the pilots managed to escape the wreckage nearly unscathed and were recovered by an awaiting helicopter search-and-rescue team. The Russian Ministry of Defense, in an official statement, confirmed that both pilots are now in stable condition, following a thorough medical evaluation at a nearby military hospital. They will continue to undergo monitoring and receive any necessary treatment to ensure their well-being and readiness to return to duty. It is currently unclear what caused the sophisticated aircraft to crash, an aspect that has spurred the commencement of a thorough investigation by the Russian government and relevant aviation authorities. The outcome of this investigation is expected to provide valuable insights into the aircraft's technical details and performance. Additionally, any potential vulnerabilities or manufacturing defects will be identified, allowing for the implementation of corrective measures and augmenting the reliability of the aircraft in future operations. The safety of military personnel remains a paramount concern for nations globally, and the quick thinking and decisive actions exhibited by both pilots involved in this incident are a testament to their rigorous training and commitment to duty. The Russian government, while tackling this rare occurrence, has also extended appreciation for the swift response of search-and-rescue teams, crediting their timely intervention for the successful recovery of the pilots. As the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash continues, it is vital to recognize the sacrifices that military personnel make to ensure the security and safety of their nation. Moreover, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in military aviation, as well as the need for continuous evaluation and improvement in aircraft design and technology. The findings of the ongoing investigation will hold significant implications for Russia's military strategy, providing essential information to facilitate improvements in both the aircraft's manufacturing and the training protocols of pilots. The unwavering resolve of the Russian military, as demonstrated through this event, is a stark indication of its commitment to understanding and addressing the potential challenges that lie ahead in the ever-evolving landscape of modern warfare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Serial attention-seeker Andrew Davies, 51, was given the anti-social behaviour order after he took to lying in the road and feigning injuries in order to dupe passing motorists into calling him an ambulance. Incredibly, the order bans Davies from deliberately falling over and lying on the ground anywhere in England or Wales, if he is doing it to for attention. Andrew Davies, 51, was given an ASBO after he took to lying in the road and feigning injuries for attention. A court heard how he began pestering emergency services with prank calls but later went to increasingly bizarre lengths to get his kicks, as neighbours and ambulance crews became familiar with his antics and tried to ignore him. After being persuaded by police to give up his mobile phone, Davies decided to attract attention instead by wandering the streets near his home in Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, before pretending to fall over and acting as though he had been injured. When his increasingly fed-up neighbours began ignoring his amateur dramatics, he took to busy main roads nearby and would lie on the ground, pretending he had been hit by a car, until someone stopped to assist him. Davies was handed the two-year ASBO, which also prohibits him from being drunk in a public place and calling the emergency services unless in a genuine emergency, by magistrates in High Wycombe. The bench ruled that the ASBO was necessary to protect the public and emergency services from the consequences of his anti-social behaviour. PC Chris Allman, from Thames Valley Police, said: 'Davies came to police attention initially by making time-wasting calls to the emergency services. On most occasions he would be intoxicated. 'When dealt with by a police and council joint team he gave away his telephone to stop the temptation. However he then took to pretending to fall in the street near his home as a way of attracting attention to himself. 'He would lay there feigning an injury until an ambulance attended. Local residents came to know what he was doing and started to ignore him and regard him as a nuisance. Davies then would orchestrate his falls on a nearby main road whereby he would be seen by a larger number of people. High Wycombe Magistrates' Court (pictured) where Davies was given the ASBO. He is banned from deliberately falling over, drinking in public, and contacting the emergency services unless it is a genuine emergency. 'Numerous motorists have done the decent thing and stopped to assist the man laying on the ground. Not realising they were being duped, they invariably would call an ambulance to attend to him. 'The ambulance staff and paramedics would normally recognise Davies and know what he was doing but were duty-bound to deal with him professionally. On a number of occasions he was taken to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury where he was more thoroughly checked over but he was always discharged as having no injuries. 'He has been offered support from numerous agencies and given many opportunities to change his behaviour. Davies' continual lack of engagement has ultimately resulted in this town wide ASBO.'

Given the question: Children who grow up in households where books are plentiful go further in school than those without books, a new study finds. This book benefit was seen across countries, and held regardless of the parent's educational back-ground, father's occupation or the political system of the country, the researchers say. The results, based on data from 73,249 people living in 27 countries, including the United States, show that having a 500-book library boosted a child's education by 3.2 years on average. \\"You get a great effect for your books,\\" said study researcher Mariah Evans, a sociologist at the University of Nevada, Reno. \\"It's quite a good return-on-investment in a time of scarce resources.\\" For years, educators have thought the strongest predictor of attaining high levels of education was having parents who were highly educated. But according to the findings, a good-sized book library is just as good as university-educated parents in terms of increasing education level. \\"Even a little bit goes a long way,\\" in terms of the number of books in a home, Evans said. Having as few as 20 books in the home still has a significant impact on propelling a child to a higher level of education, and the more books are added, the greater the benefit. In some countries, such as China, having 500 or more books in the home propels children 6. 6 years further in their education. In the United States, the effect is less, 2.4 years. But, Evans points out that 2.4 years is still a significant advantage in terms of educational achievement. For example, Americans who have some college or an associate's degree, but not a bachelor's degree, earn an average of 7,213 more annually than those with just a high school education. Those who attain a bachelor's degree earn 21,185 more each year, on average, than those with just high school diplomas. Having books in the home is twice as important as the father's education level, and more important than whether a child was educated in China or the United States.

Please answer the following question: Michael has become bored with his passive life style, and has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby. He begins to exercise with weights several times a week. Michael's brother, Robert, isn't as motivated as Michael though. Robert decides to continue being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months. Who will increase the size of their muscles more? Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Michael will increase the size of his muscles more than Robert. This is because Michael exercises with weights several times a week, while Robert exercises with weights only every couple of months. Using skeletal muscles, such as during weight lifting, increases their size and strength. In order for the muscles to remain bigger and stronger, continued exercise is necessary. Since Michael is consistently exercising and challenging his muscles, he will see more significant muscle growth and strength improvements compared to his brother Robert, who exercises infrequently. Essentially, Michael is following the \\"use it or lose it\\" principle for muscle growth and strength."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which patient would have higher reflex time, patient A or patient B? Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to.

Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Paragraph: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Jessica's plan? A:","completion":"Under Jessica's plan, the number of animals is likely to decrease. Jessica's proposal to emit more anthropogenic gases would contribute to an increase in greenhouse gases, further exacerbating global warming and climate change. Such changes adversely impact natural habitats and ecosystems, leading to a reduction in wildlife populations. Therefore, Jessica's plan would likely result in a negative outcome for the planet and its biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Media caption The anti-Gaddafi fighters at Sirte are made up of battalions from Misrata Libya's interim authorities say their fighters have entered the outskirts of the coastal city of Sirte, one of the last places still loyal to ex-leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. Fighters had breached defences south and west of the city, about 8km (5 miles) from the centre on Thursday evening, but met heavy resistance, the National Transitional Council said. Meanwhile, Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan has arrived in Libya as part of a tour asserting Ankara's regional influence and promoting democracy. His visit comes a day after crowds in Benghazi cheered UK PM David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the first foreign leaders to visit since Col Gaddafi was ousted. 'We are strong' An NTC spokesman told the BBC that fighters had been forced to retreat about two kilometres to treat casualties following their incursion into the outlying areas of Sirte, where they reportedly clashed with snipers in a high-rise tower and an elite unit of pro-Gaddafi troops. The anti-Gaddafi fighters - made up of battalions from Misrata, 200km (120 miles) to the west - suffered at least four deaths and seven wounded, although a report quoting the Misrata Military Council said 11 were killed and 34 hurt. Col Gaddafi's spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, told a Syrian TV channel that \\"thousands of volunteers\\" were ready to \\"liberate Libya\\" from the NTC. \\"We are in fact strong. We have the capabilities, the means and plans to liberate the whole of Libya,\\" he said in a phone call to the pro-Gaddafi al-Rai channel. NTC fighters are facing resistance in a handful of pro-Gaddafi bastions, including the desert town of Bani Walid, the southern outpost of Sabha and Sirte, Col Gaddafi's birthplace. Last week anti-Gaddafi forces said they were hours from taking Bani Walid, but were driven back. One unconfirmed report suggested columns of anti-Gaddafi fighters would again move on the town on Friday. \\"We have received orders from our commanders and we are going into Bani Walid today from different locations,\\" fighter Mohammed Jwaida, stationed some 20km north of the town, was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. Rapturous reception The BBC's Peter Biles, in Tripoli, says the visit of Mr Cameron and Mr Sarkozy left many people in Tripoli and Benghazi clearly elated. Image caption Abir: \\"I sense that they are here to explore the situation, to find out what people think of our liberation. It is a big and positive step and it is also reassuring for our people on a security level. Since they feel safe to visit Tripoli it means that there is security and stability.\\" Since [the leaders] feel safe to visit Tripoli, it means that there is security and stability In pictures: Battle for SirteLibyan voices on leaders' visit The leaders arrived in Tripoli on Thursday morning where they held talks with Libya's interim leader, NTC chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil, pledged support for the NTC and announced a series of measures, including the unfreezing of billions in Libyan assets and funding for landmine clearance. It signalled another step on the road to normality for Libya, a country that was considered, for a large part of Col Gaddafi's years in power, a pariah state, our correspondent says. In particular, the visit was an important boost for the members of Libya's interim administration, as they strive to consolidate their authority and legitimacy in Tripoli, he adds. Under heavy security, Mr Cameron and Mr Sarkozy travelled to Benghazi, the NTC's eastern stronghold and the seat of Libya's revolution. There, thousands of people filled central Liberty Square, cheering so loudly that the leaders struggled to make themselves heard. \\"It is great to be in free Libya,\\" Mr Cameron told the crowd. \\"Col Gaddafi said he would hunt you down like rats, but you showed the courage of lions.\\" Gaddafi inner circle On Friday, the NTC is to send a delegation to neighbouring Niger in an effort to recover gold and cash believed to have been taken out of Libya by fleeing Gaddafi loyalists. Mr Sarkozy and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe will also meet Niger's leadership on Friday. At least 36 members of the fugitive leader's inner circle, including relatives and generals, have fled to neighbouring Algeria and Niger since Tripoli fell to NTC forces last month. Mr Abdul Jalil said Libya would also ask for the handover of individuals wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC has indicted Col Gaddafi, his son Saif al-Islam and his intelligence chief for crimes against humanity. ||||| Libyan rebels claimed to have captured Sirte, the birthplace of Muammar Gaddafi and the last of his coastal strongholds. The city was said to have fallen after an attack involving 900 \\"technicals\\" – armed pickup trucks – that attacked loyalist positions from three directions. \\"Thwar Misrata (the Misrata revolution) now control the entrances to Sirte city,\\" said a statement from the Misrata military council. The council, which controlled the operation, said the attack began at dawn on Thursday with an assault on the front line, 30 miles west of the city. Gaddafi loyalists resisted with artillery, mortars and long-range grad rockets, but frontline positions collapsed in the early afternoon and rebel units surged eastwards towards the city. More street fighting followed in the city, but by nightfall rebel units said they were in control of Sirte centre and the exit roads, and were \\"combing\\" urban areas for key Gaddafi officials believed to be in hiding. Pockets of resistance remained, with loyalist forces surrounded in the city centre headquarters of an insurance company. Units of the 32nd brigade, commanded by Gaddafi's son Khamis, were reported to be barricaded into a line of villas along the Sirte beachfront. Nato reported destroying eight targets on Wednesday night part of a bombing campaign that has seen it strike 292 targets, including tanks, ammunition dumps, command centres and barracks, in the past three weeks. Alliance jets were in the air during the battle though it is not known if they struck targets today. Nato is also anxious to get the war over, as its mandate runs out on 27 September, and France and the UK would prefer to have the war finished by then, rather than ask for an extension in what has proved a controversial operation. Sirte, built near the site of the ancient Phoenician city of Macomedes-Euphranta, is one of Gaddafi's key military hubs. The coastal city was first targeted on 20 March, the second day of the air war, when American B2 stealth bombers destroyed 45 hardened aircraft shelters at Gardabya airport, which also served as a military airbase. Rebel forces reported two fighters killed and five more wounded, but said the figure may rise as casualties return to bases and hospitals in Misrata, 150 miles to the west. A Sirte rebel, who escaped the town on Monday to join opposition forces, told the Guardian that any attacking force must cope with the hostility of the Gaddafi tribe who remain loyal to the former Libyan leader and have formed bands of militias. The conquest, if confirmed, represents a major victory for Libya's rebels; symbolically it is the crushing of Gaddafi's authority. More practically, it opens the main east-west coastal highway, allowing the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council to move by road to the capital, Tripoli. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The fighters in Libya who are against Gaddafi have gone into the city of Sirte, which is one of the last cities that still supports Gaddafi. They are trying to take control of the city, but the people who support Gaddafi are fighting back. Some important leaders from other countries, like the United Kingdom's Prime Minister David Cameron and France's President Nicolas Sarkozy, have visited Libya to show their support for the people trying to remove Gaddafi from power. If the fighters can take control of Sirte, it will be a big victory for them and make it easier for them to bring peace and democracy to Libya."},{"prompt":"Question: Francisco Javier Alcaraz (born 4 October 1960) is a Paraguayan football forward who played for Paraguay in the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

The paragraph mentions key details about the church's location (Belvidere, Allegany County, New York), structure (one-story, board and batten clad, rectangular, slate gable roof) and architectural style (Gothic Revival with Carpenter Gothic elements). It also highlights the historical significance of the building, and mentions its establishment date (1860). However, the paragraph does not include any information about visitation numbers, frequency, or popularity of the Christ Episcopal Church. This type of information would be necessary to validate or refute the hypothesis. Visitor numbers to a site like Christ Episcopal Church could be influenced by a variety of factors including but not limited to: its historical importance, architectural style and elements, the size and religious beliefs of the local population, its schedule of services and events, tourism marketing and promotion, the accessibility and attractiveness of its location, and general tourism trends in the region. Given that the paragraph does not provide any details on these aspects nor direct data on visitor numbers or popularity, any conclusions drawn about the levels of visitation to the Christ Episcopal Church would be purely speculative based on the information provided.

Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will cause less fertilizer to end up in the ponds near their farm? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil.

Look in notices in the paper, online, or ask around for recommendations by word-of-mouth.","completion":"Book your hayride in advance Once you've found a location that offers a hayride, check their website or call them to find out if they require advance reservations. Some hayrides might only operate during specific times of the year, like autumn, so it's essential to check their hours of operation. If a reservation is necessary, be sure to book your spot early to secure your preferred date and time. This also gives you ample time to organize your schedule and make travel plans. Choose the right time Hayrides are typically more enjoyable during the evening when the air is cool, and you may have a better chance of seeing wildlife or enjoying a sunset or views of the night sky. If the hayride is being offered as part of a larger event, such as a pumpkin patch or fall festival, consider visiting earlier in the day to participate in other festivities before embarking on your hayride. Dress appropriately Since hayrides are typically held outdoors, it's crucial to dress comfortably and appropriately for the weather. Be sure to check the forecast and be prepared for fluctuating temperatures, especially if you'll be on the ride during the evening. Wear layers that you can adjust as needed; consider a sweater, flannel shirt, or jacket. Shoes should be comfortable and suitable for walking on potentially uneven terrain, like sneakers or boots. And, while hayrides can be a bit dusty, don't forget a hat, sunglasses, or even a light scarf to cover your face, should the need arise. Bring along supplies and snacks When going on a hayride, you might want to bring some essentials with you. If your hayride allows it, pack some snacks and drinks for the duration of the ride. Make sure they are securely contained to prevent spills during bumpy rides. If you have kids, consider bringing some toys or games to keep them entertained. You might want to have a blanket or small cushion to make the ride even more comfortable, especially if you have young children or older family members joining you. Consider a hayride theme Some hayrides offer themed options, like haunted hayrides or Christmas hayrides. These can be a fun way to celebrate the season or a holiday. Consider researching the different hayrides available near you and finding one that will provide the best experience for you and your family or friends. Ensure safety and cleanliness It's essential to make sure that the hayride facility you choose maintains a safe and clean environment. Look for reviews from previous guests, and be prepared with hand sanitizer, face masks, and any other personal protective equipment you feel necessary. Make it a social event Inviting friends or family to join you on your hayride adventure can make the experience even more enjoyable. With a larger group, you'll have more people to engage with and create lasting memories. Additionally, coordinating a group outing could potentially save you money if the hayride company offers group discounts. Capture the moments Bring along a camera or smartphone to capture the memories you'll create on your hayride. Take plenty of pictures of the scenic views, your friends, and family having fun, and any interesting sights along the way. These photos will serve as a great reminder of your enjoyable hayride experience. Create or participate in traditions Consider making hayrides a seasonal family tradition for you and your loved ones. This can help create lasting memories, provide an opportunity to bond with each other, and give everyone something to look forward to every year. Additionally, participate in any traditions or fun activities the hayride venue or accompanying event might offer, like pumpkin carving, apple picking, or decorating cookies. By following these steps and tips, you can ensure that you and your loved ones enjoy a fun, safe, and memorable hayride experience.

In this case, the tweet conveys a predominantly positive sentiment, as evidenced by several factors. 1. Use of the term \\"Cool\\": By starting with \\"Cool,\\" the user expresses a positive reaction to whatever information they were given by @shapeshed, likely about the location mentioned in the tweet. The use of this term reflects a general appreciation or interest in the topic that has been mentioned. 2. Timeframe of the experience: The user mentions having returned from a particular place 4 weeks ago. By sharing this information, they provide context about how recent the event was. This conveys that they still have vivid memories of this holiday and may still be riding on the positive emotions associated with it, emphasizing its importance to them. 3. Enthusiasm for the holiday: The user then goes on to describe the experience as the \\"best holiday ever.\\" This statement clearly highlights the user's extreme satisfaction and happiness derived from their vacation. The use of the superlative \\"best\\" denotes that this particular holiday outshines all others they might have had, making it especially memorable and noteworthy. 4. Use of ellipsis: The tweet ends with an ellipsis (a series of three dots), which suggests a trailing off in thought. This can signal a reminiscing tone, as if the user is reflecting on the wonderful time they had during their holiday. The ellipsis implies that there might be more to say, but that the user is keeping these thoughts to themselves, possibly due to the character limit on Twitter or simply a desire to maintain a sense of personal nostalgia. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as positive, happy, and enthusiastic, with a hint of wistfulness in the ellipsis at the end.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Arthur succeeds as King of Britain? Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, completed c. 1138, contains the first narrative account of Arthur's life. This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded. He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds, never to be seen again. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Uther Pendragon"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

In the ceremony held at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, Chief Executive Donald Tsang handed the torch to the first torchbearer, Olympic medalist Lee Lai Shan. The torch relay then traveled through Nathan Road, Lantau Link, Sha Tin (crossed Shing Mun River via a dragon boat, which had been never used before in the history of Olympic torch relays), Victoria Harbour (crossed by Tin Hau, a VIP vessel managed by the Marine Department) before ending in Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai. A total of 120 torchbearers were selected to participate in the event consisting of celebrities, athletes and pro-Beijing camp politicians. No politicians from the pro-democracy camp were selected as torchbearers. One torchbearer could not participate due to flight delay. It was estimated that more than 200,000 spectators came out and watched the relay. Many enthusiastic supporters wore red shirts and waved large Chinese flags. According to Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration Henry Tang, 3,000 police were deployed to ensure order.

He was nervous because he didn't really believe in it. Fred diligently lined up with his co-workers on the picket line. They yelled and got angry at customers crossing their line. Fred finally had enough and got a job at a non-union store. Sentence: fred is not very strong willed","completion":"The text provided describes the situation of Fred, who worked at a grocery store that was about to go on strike. He felt nervous as he didn't quite believe in the strike, but he participated in the picket line along with his co-workers regardless. They yelled and showed their anger towards customers crossing their line, but eventually, Fred had enough and decided to get a job at a non-union store. The sentence \\"Fred is not very strong-willed\\" can be considered true to some extent when analyzing the situation. Here are some reasons why: 1. Lack of Conviction: Fred didn't really believe in the strike but chose to participate in it, showing that he wasn't strong-willed enough to stand up for his beliefs and refrain from engaging in an activity that he didn't genuinely support. 2. Influence of Peer Pressure: Fred's decision to join the picket line despite having doubts about the strike can be seen as giving in to peer pressure. Had he been more strong-willed, he might have been able to resist this pressure and make a decision based on his own beliefs. 3. Change of Job: Finally, Fred decided to leave the union grocery store and find a job at a non-union store. This decision, while demonstrating initiative and a desire for change, also highlights that he wasn't strong-willed enough to stay and try to make a difference at his previous workplace. However, it is important to consider that demonstrating adaptability, flexibility, and the ability to make pragmatic decisions in difficult situations can also be seen as strengths. Fred felt unhappy with the situation in his workplace and the strike, making the decision to leave a union store for a non-union one; it could be argued that this may represent a display of strength in recognizing his own values and priorities. In conclusion, from the text, it can be determined that the statement \\"Fred is not very strong-willed\\" is true to some degree, but it is crucial to consider that his actions may also be viewed as a show of self-awareness and adaptability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read all the given sentences carefully and try to understand the overall idea of the short story. 2. Identify the starting point or context-setting sentence. In this case, it is Sentence2, which talks about the protagonist's desire to see the sloths and provides context for their visit to the zoo. 3. Identify the sentence that logically follows the starting point. Sentence3 mentions the protagonist visiting the zoo with friends, so that comes next in the sequence. 4. Continue the story's logical progression by selecting the sentence that fits best after the previous one. After visiting the zoo, Sentence5 tells us that they visited almost all exhibits without seeing any sloths. 5. Now, look for any remaining sentences that contribute to the story's resolution or climax. In this case, Sentence4 mentions that they finally find the sloths in the last exhibit, so it comes next. 6. The last sentence should wrap up the story. Sentence1 says they're gratified, which makes sense as a conclusion since they finally found the sloths they were seeking. So, the correct order is: Sentence2, Sentence3, Sentence5, Sentence4, and Sentence1. Your output should be '23541'."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Have you ever been stuck for hours on a hard math problem? If you sat there for some time you might eventually solve it, but scientists say that daydreaming might be a much better way to tackle difficult tasks. In fact, daydreaming has long been misunderstood. It's considered to be a bad thing and often associated with laziness. \\"We're harsh on ourselves if we catch ourselves mind wandering,\\" says Professor Kalina Christoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada. But the truth is that some of the most important scientific discoveries came about because scientists allowed their minds to wander. For example, Albert Einstein began his theory of relativity when he daydreamed about riding a beam of sunlight to the edge of the universe. And now, research has shown that normal people can also improve their problems solving ability in the same way, reported The Telegraph. In a study, 145 people aged between 19 and 32 were asked to list as many unusual uses as possible for everyday objects. Some of them were given a 12-minute break while the others were not allowed any break from the task. People on the break did not simply relax--some of them were told to carry out a tiring memory task while others did an easier task. Scientists found that people who did the easier task were daydreaming a lot. They thought about personal issues in the past or in the future because their mind was at ease. After the break, all participants were asked to return once again to the task of listing unusual uses for everyday objects. It was found that daydreamers improved their performance by 40 percent, while all the other people, including those who didn't have a break and who did tiring tasks during the break, performed the same as before. \\"People think that when the mind wanders away, it just gets turned off--but we show the opposite,\\" explained Christoff.\\"A more playful attitude might allow you to call in more resources .\\" So when you are struggling to solve complicated problems, it might be better off if you switch to a...

However, most of the land is not very fertile, and it only produces a modest amount of food. Argentina is a distant second, followed by Brazil, the United States and China. In Africa, only a very small amount of land is registered for organic farming. That does not mean Africa relies on chemicals. In fact, many farmers do not use chemicals because they cannot afford them. Yet there are no programs for these farmers to prove they do not use chemicals. Without these programs their food can never be approved organic. India has had the most dramatic recent increase in organic farming. Like many other countries, India sees continual growth in organic food sales around the world. This, of course, leads to growth in profits. Sales of organic food were more than doubled from 2000 to 2005. Like India, many countries are trying to increase commercial organic farming to get a share of the sales. This has led to criticism. Some people believe that organic farming should not just be about making money. They think the goal is to help the environment. Others say organic farming will not continue if it is not profitable. They say that people should be able to make money while providing food that is healthy to mankind. Answer:","completion":"Which of the following statements about organic farming and its growth is true based on the article? A) Organic farming has only recently begun to gain popularity in small shops. B) Australia has the most land devoted to organic farming, but it only produces a modest amount of food due to soil fertility issues.

Question: Information: - Field artillery is a category of mobile artillery used to support armies in the field. These weapons are specialized for mobility, tactical proficiency, long range, short range and extremely long range target engagement. - Infantry is the general branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot. As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry. - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower. - Fortifications are military constructions or buildings designed for the defense of territories in warfare, and also used to solidify rule in a region during peace time. Humans have constructed defensive works for many thousands of years, in a variety of increasingly complex designs. The term is derived from the Latin \\"fortis\\" (\\"strong\\") and \\"facere\\" (\\"to make\\"). - A siege is a military blockade of a city or fortress with the intent of conquering by attrition or assault. This derives from \\"sedere\\", Latin for \\"to sit\\". Siege warfare is a form of constant, low-intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static defensive position. Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is not uncommon, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy. - A tractor unit (prime mover or traction unit) is a characteristically heavy-duty towing engine that provides motive power for hauling a towed or trailered load. These fall into two categories: very heavy-duty typically off-road capable, often 6×6, military and commercial tractor units, including ballast tractors, and heavy and medium duty military and commercial rear-wheel drive \\"semi tractors\\" used for hauling semi-trailers. - A ballast tractor is a specially weighted tractor unit of a heavy hauler combination. It is designed to utilize a drawbar to pull or push heavy or exceptionally large trailored loads. When feasible, lowboy-style semi-trailers are used to minimize a load's center of gravity. Typical drivetrains are 6×4 and 6×6. - In international arms control, small arms include revolvers and pistols, rifles and carbines, assault rifles, submachine guns and light machine guns. Together with light weapons (heavy machine guns; hand-held grenade launchers; portable anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns; recoilless rifles; portable launchers of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missile systems; and mortars of calibres of less than 100 mm), they comprise the Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) protocol. - A half-track is a civilian or military vehicle with regular wheels at the front for steering and continuous tracks at the back to propel the vehicle and carry most of the load. The purpose of this combination is to produce a vehicle with the cross-country capabilities of a tank and the handling of a wheeled vehicle. - Self-propelled artillery (also called mobile artillery or locomotive artillery) is artillery equipped with its own propulsion system to move towards its target. Within the term are covered self-propelled guns (or howitzers) and rocket artillery. They are high mobility vehicles, usually based on continuous tracks carrying either a large howitzer, field gun, a mortar or some form of rocket or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range indirect bombardment support on the battlefield. - A semi-trailer (British English) or semitrailer (American English) is a trailer without a front axle. In the US, the term is also used to refer to the combination of a truck and a semi-trailer, a tractor-trailer. - An artillery tractor , also referred to as a gun tractor , is a specialized heavy - duty form of tractor unit used to tow artillery pieces of varying weights and calibres . It may be wheeled , tracked , or half - tracked . - A siege engine is a device that is designed to break or circumvent city walls and other fortifications in siege warfare. Some have been operated close to the fortifications, while others have been used to attack from a distance. From antiquity, siege engines were constructed largely of wood and tended to use mechanical advantage to fling stones and similar missiles. With the development of gunpowder and improved metallurgical techniques, siege engines became artillery. Collectively, siege engines or artillery together with the necessary troops and transport vehicles to conduct a siege are referred to as a siege-train.

In other words, don’t freeze uncooked or undercooked filling ingredients and expect them to cook through in the oven later. Uncooked or undercooked meats could pose a serious health hazard. This is one of the many elements of frozen pie baking in which you can easily find a wide range of opinions. Your best bet is to try the different methods and see which works for you. Some cooks recommend cooking the filling and freezing it and the (unrolled) pie crust separately in labeled freezer bags. In this case, you would allow each element to thaw to the point to which you could assemble the pie. Others, however, prefer the method of assembling the pie then freezing it whole. That way, you can pop it straight from the freezer into the oven. In this instance, don’t freeze the pie in a glass dish as it could shatter in the oven. Not surprisingly, a frozen pie will take a bit longer to cook through than an unfrozen one. You may also find that you need to reduce the temperature a little so that the edges don’t burn before the center cooks through. For example, one pot pie recipe recommends baking unfrozen at 400 °F (204 °C) for about 30 minutes, and frozen at 375 °F (191 °C) for up to 45 minutes. If you’re concerned about not getting good browning on the bottom crust, start out at the regular temperature for the first 15 minutes or so, then reduce it. If the edge crust is getting too brown before the center of the pie heats through, you can also try creating a ring-shaped heat shield out of aluminum foil, which you can (carefully) place over the edge of the pie. Use another pie dish as a template.

I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where did the person who is re-making the Sissinghurst garden serve before taking on the project? John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.

Question: The Alps were created by two what meeting? Context: The formation of the Alps (the Alpine orogeny) was an episodic process that began about 300 million years ago. In the Paleozoic Era the Pangaean supercontinent consisted of a single tectonic plate; it broke into separate plates during the Mesozoic Era and the Tethys sea developed between Laurasia and Gondwana during the Jurassic Period. The Tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the Alpide belt, from Gibraltar through the Himalayas to Indonesia—a process that began at the end of the Mesozoic and continues into the present. The formation of the Alps was a segment of this orogenic process, caused by the collision between the African and the Eurasian plates that began in the late Cretaceous Period.

Answer the following question: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: Why did the author's mother make him shovel the snow from the homes of the elderly? Options: A. To provide them with some relief from the snow B. Because she owed them money C. not enough information D. Because it was the only work available in the area === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"A.

When I was writing the manuscript for Florentine, I enlisted the help of an army of recipe testers — about 80 people from all over the world — to test every recipe thoroughly. Only one came back to me consistently with problems. From Minnesota to Melbourne, three testers wrote to me that their very first attempt at making Tuscan gnudi (ricotta and spinach balls that, rather than be encased in pasta like for ravioli, are simply dusted in flour) resulted in a pot of simmering water with “dissolved” gnudi. It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi’s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared – O dove’erano andati? “Where did they go?” In the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors — was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use “proper” ricotta? Aha. “Proper” ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind — to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this. In that case, it would have probably been better to make your own, or choose another recipe. When does the author suggest to used the right type of ricotta?

Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic. But I can use this background: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. What is an answer for this question: In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B? Answer:","completion":"Sample A would produce ATP molecules, as it has a higher respiration rate which allows for the process of cellular respiration to convert glucose into ATP molecules, providing energy for the organism. Sample B, with no respiration rate, would not be able to carry out cellular respiration effectively and thus would not produce ATP molecules efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the overall process, it can be broken down into several key stages: 1. Inhalation: In the initial phase, air is drawn into the body through the nose and/or mouth. This air contains vital oxygen, along with other gases, which is necessary for our body to create energy. 2. Gas exchange in the lungs: The oxygen-rich air enters the lungs and is carried through a complex network of bronchi, which eventually lead to tiny air sacs called alveoli. The alveoli are surrounded by tiny blood vessels called capillaries that facilitate the efficient exchange of gases between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the capillaries. 3. Oxygen transport: Oxygen in the inhaled air binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells within the capillaries. These oxygenated blood cells are then transported throughout the body by the circulatory system to supply the body's tissues and organs with the oxygen they require. 4. Cellular respiration: At a cellular level, oxygen is utilized to generate energy through a complex biochemical process called cellular respiration. During this process, oxygen reacts with glucose (a simple sugar) to produce usable energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). As a byproduct of this reaction, waste gas in the form of carbon dioxide is produced. 5. Carbon dioxide transport: The carbon dioxide waste gas produced in cellular respiration diffuses out of the cells and into the surrounding capillaries, where it binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. The bloodstream then transports these carbon dioxide-laden blood cells back toward the lungs. 6. Gas exchange in the lungs (removal of carbon dioxide): As the blood carrying carbon dioxide reaches the alveoli in the lungs, the waste gas diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli. This process essentially reverses the earlier gas exchange when oxygen was absorbed into the blood, preparing the carbon dioxide to be expelled from the body. 7. Exhalation: The final step of the process occurs when the diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity, relaxes and rises. This action causes the pressure inside the lungs to increase, forcing the carbon dioxide-rich air out of the lungs and expelling it through the nose and mouth. This series of events maintains a continuous cycle of oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide removal, ensuring that our body cells are supplied with the oxygen needed to create energy and sustain life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the Colloquy of Marburg, which has become infamous for its failure.

Question: What is Baron von Frankenstein's relationship to Katrin? Movie title: Flesh for Frankenstein Movie plot: Baron von Frankenstein neglects his duties towards his wife/sister Katrin, as he is obsessed with creating a perfect Serbian race to obey his commands, beginning by assembling a perfect male and female from parts of corpses. The doctor's sublimation of his sexual urges by his powerful urge for domination is shown when he utilizes the surgical wounds of his female creation to satisfy his lust. He is dissatisfied with the inadequate reproductive urges of his current male creation, and seeks a head donor with a greater libido; he also repeatedly exhibits an intense interest that the creature's \\"nasum\\" (nose) have a correctly Serbian shape.[6][7] As it happens, a suitably randy farmhand, Nicholas, leaving a local brothel along with his sexually repressed friend, brought there in an unsuccessful attempt to dissuade him from entering a monastery, are spotted and waylaid by the doctor and his henchman, Otto; mistakenly assuming that the prospective monk is also suitable for stud duty, they take his head for use on the male creature. Not knowing these behind-the-scene details, Nicholas survives and is summoned by Katrin to the castle, where they form an agreement that he will gratify her unsatisfied carnal appetites.[6][7] Under the control of the doctor, the male and female creatures are seated for dinner with the castle's residents, but the male creature shows no signs of recognition of his friend as he serves the Baron and his family. Nicholas realizes at this point that something is awry, but himself pretends not to recognize his friend's face until he can investigate further. After a falling-out with Katrin, who is merely concerned with her own needs, Nicholas goes snooping in the laboratory and is captured by the doctor. Frankenstein muses about using his new acquisition to replace the head of his creature, who is still showing no signs of libido. Nevertheless, Katrin is rewarded for betraying Nicholas by being granted use of the creature for erotic purposes, but is killed during a bout of overly vigorous...

She didn't have enough money to get on the subway, but she looked rich. She was a television producer, earned 900 a week, and had a closetful of designer labels like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. But she also had a 20,221.40 credit card bill and an empty bank account. Karyn decided that it was time for a change. She built a website and simply asked people to help her out by sending her a dollar or two. On the site, Karyn honestly explained her situation. \\"If 20,000 people gave me just 1, I'd be home free.\\" Amazingly, it worked. Her website was visited by more than a million people. Although most donors just gave a few dollars, one generous donor sent 1,000. She was on TV and in newspapers and magazines. She was offered a book deal and a movie contract. And of course, she was able to pay off her credit card debt. She also sold her designer clothes on eBay. In her closet, where the Gucci purse once sat, Karyn keeps all the letters that people have sent her. It's hard to understand why so many people helped a total stranger pay off her huge credit card bill.

Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities.

Well, guess what? Some people from BBC Pop Up, a group who travels and tells us stories about different countries, went to India! This time, they tried to find out the answer to this cool question. So let's explore and learn together! India is a big country with lots of people and many ways to travel. In Delhi, a huge city in India, there are two popular ways to get around: by autorickshaw or by using Uber, an app where you can ask a driver to pick you up in their car. Autorickshaw, also known as auto, is like a small three-wheeled vehicle that can carry people from one place to another. It's very common on Indian roads, and it is super colorful! Now, back to the fun race. BBC Pop Up decided to see which one was faster: if they called an Uber driver or if they hopped onto an autorickshaw. They wanted to know which one could take people around Delhi quicker. To make it a fair competition, they started the race from the same place and at the same time. They also needed to go to the same destination, so nobody would have an advantage. During the race, the autorickshaw zoomed through the busy streets, weaving in and out of traffic. It was small and could fit into tight spaces that the car couldn't. On the other hand, the Uber car was very comfortable, and the driver could use a GPS to find the fastest route, which is a smart computer thing that shows the best way to go. The people watching the race were very excited and curious to see which one would win. After some time, they finally found the answer: it seemed that the autorickshaw was a little bit faster! Hurray for the autorickshaw! So kids, next time you or your family visit India, you know that taking an autorickshaw might actually be faster than calling an Uber car. Plus, it can be a fun and exciting adventure! Just remember that sometimes, finding the fastest way to get around a city might not always be in a big and fancy car. Sometimes, a small, colorful, and lively vehicle like an autorickshaw can do the trick too!

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS.

(CNN) -- Iran's Red Crescent Society will try to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza by sending food and medical supplies to the besieged Palestinian territory, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday. Red Crescent official Abdul Rauf Adibzadeh said one shipment of relief goods will arrive in Gaza via Egypt by the end of the week, Iranian media reported. The aid group is also preparing to send two relief ships to the coast of Gaza, including a hospital ship with doctors, nurses and operating rooms and another vessel with more relief goods like food and medication, the IRNA and Mehr news agencies reported. Adibzadeh said there is a possibility that Iranian Red Crescent ships may be attacked but added that, despite the danger, if the Iranian authorities approve, the shipments will be sent to","completion":"Gaza. As the Iranian Red Crescent Society makes preparations and arrangements to send aid to Gaza, their efforts are indeed laudable and showcase their commitment to helping those affected by the ongoing crisis in the region. The Israeli blockade of Gaza has significantly impacted access to essential supplies, such as food, medical equipment, and lifesaving medication. In these challenging circumstances, it is important to explore the potential implications and ramifications of Iran's Red Crescent Society's decision to break the Israeli blockade. Firstly, the economic and humanitarian crisis in Gaza is quite dire. With the blockade in place for over a decade, the situation has been exacerbated by restrictions on movement, unemployment, poverty, and the lack of access to basic services such as healthcare, electricity, and clean water. By sending food and medical supplies, the Iranian Red Crescent aims to alleviate some of the hardships faced by civilians in the region. The initial shipment through Egypt will offer much-needed relief in the immediate term, while the two subsequent ships, including a fully equipped hospital and relief vessel, can provide longer-term support and assistance. This mission demonstrates Iran's commitment to helping those in need and also reflects the country's evolving foreign policy objectives. Iran has historically been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause and has often criticized Israel's actions against the Palestinians. By providing aid and assistance to Gaza, Iran is strengthening its position in the region and building relations with groups that consider Israel an adversary. This move might also gain Iran more recognition and support from other countries and organizations sympathetic to the Palestinians or opposing the Israeli blockade. However, there are potential risks and dangers involved in attempting to break the Israeli blockade, which Iran must address. With tensions already high between Israel and Iran, sending ships with Iranian flags to Gaza might be perceived as a provocation by the Israeli government. The Israeli navy has a history of intercepting and even attacking vessels attempting to break the blockade, including the infamous 2010 Mavi Marmara incident that resulted in the deaths of several activists. Additionally, Israel might view Iran's Red Crescent Society's actions as supporting extremist groups based in Gaza, such as Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States, and the European Union. This could potentially further strain the already tense relationship between Israel and Iran and lead to increased hostility between the two countries. It is crucial that Iran's Red Crescent Society, along with relevant international organizations, works towards ensuring the safety and well-being of those involved in the aid mission. This includes conducting ongoing security assessments, coordinating closely with Egyptian authorities during the initial shipment's transit through Egypt, and engaging in diplomatic efforts to facilitate the safe passage of the relief ships to Gaza. Furthermore, maintaining transparency about the contents of the shipments and the motive behind this mission can help mitigate allegations of hidden agendas and lessen the chances of a military confrontation at sea. In conclusion, the efforts of Iran's Red Crescent Society to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza and provide essential food and medical supplies are commendable, but they must be weighed against the potential risks involved. It is imperative that Iran, Israel, and other regional stakeholders engage in dialogue and diplomacy to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza and prevent any escalation of tensions that could exacerbate an already fragile situation. Ultimately, it is the people of Gaza who stand to benefit or bear the consequences of these actions, and it remains the responsibility of all parties involved to prioritize their well-being and safety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It turned out the teen had been carrying his unborn twin inside him for 15 years, and he recently underwent surgery to remove the mass in what may be the first case of its kind in Malaysia, Fox News reported. “The fetus removed from my son's stomach was formed with organs like those of a baby -- only the nose and mouth were not complete,” said Hasmah Ahmad, the teen’s mother, according to The Mirror. This included an almost complete genitalia and hair. A teenage boy in Malaysia underwent surgery to have his unborn twin removed after 15 years. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images This condition, known as \\"fetus in fetu,\\" is rare, occurring about once in every 500,000 births. It was first described by German anatomist Johann Friedrich Meckel in the late 18th century and is characterized as having the presence of one of the twins in the body of the other. It's usually located in the retroperitoneal area — or the space between the membrane lining the cavity of the abdomen and the posterior abdominal wall. Some scientists have speculated this condition is a result of a teratoma,which is a tumor that may contain several types of body tissue, including muscle, teeth, and bone. However, Meckel has determined that the fetus in fetu condition is the result of an underdeveloped twin. The difference between a fetus in fetu and teratoma is that a fetus in fetu displays “evidence of body plan organization, such as having vertebrae, limb buds, or organ tissue,” Medical Daily previously reported. Saidin, who is the fifth of eight children, had an “oddly rounded shape tummy” since he was a year old, Malaysian Digest reported. However, it didn’t adversely affect him physically until he reached secondary school. His movements became more restricted due to his growing, protruding stomach. He was taken to the doctor once he started complaining of intense stomach pains. The teen and his family held a funeral for the fetus, and buried the remains in a cemetery. The last recorded case of fetus in fetu occurred in 2015, when a 45-year-old woman discovered that a 10-centimeter mass growing on her left ovary was her unborn twin. Similar to Saidin’s case, the mass also looked like an underdeveloped human with a partially formed face, an eye, a tooth, and long black hair. ||||| Since birth, a teenage boy in Malaysia has carried around the unborn fetus of his twin. Recently, the teen successfully underwent surgery to remove the mass, which is believed to be the first such case in the country, Central European News (CEN) reported. Mohd Zul Shahril Saidin, 15, is the fifth of eight children and a native of the town of Baling. He was only hospitalized within the last four months after complaining of pain, CEN reported. After the surgery, reports suggest the fetus had hair, legs, hands and genitals. “The fetus removed from my son’s stomach was formed with organs like those of a baby— only the nose and mouth were not complete,” Hasmah Ahmad, the teen’s mother, told CEN. The condition is known as “fetus in fetu,” a rare congenital anomaly in which a malformed and parasitic fetus is located in the body of its twin, according to the National Institutes of Health. The mass resided in Saidin’s abdomen. The phenomenon occurs in 1 in every 500,000 live births, CEN reported. The family has performed funeral rites on the fetus, which has been buried in a cemetery. ||||| Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

Sinar Harian reported that the boy, who prefers to only be known as Shahril underwent a surgery recently to remove the ‘mass’ from his body following persistent stomach aches and the worsening condition of his unusually rounded tummy. Doctors were shocked when a ‘creature’- a mass of tissue with lengthy hair, partially formed limbs and almost complete genitalia instead emerged from the young teen’s body. The rare condition is scientifically known as “foetus-in-fetu,” which occurs when one half of a twin forms in the body of the other, making this by far the first of its kind to be reported in Malaysia and only a handful of cases have been reported around the world. That parasitic twin has since been safely removed out of the 15-year-old who had a history of seeking medical attention since he was a year old for his oddly rounded shape tummy. Sharil has been an active child growing up, playing football and other sports like any other young boys his age without facing any complications. He also displayed a big appetite and at one point remarked, “I have to feed the baby in my stomach,” while downing food in large quantities. However, his physical movements became more restricted once he entered secondary school due to his ever growing protruding stomach, which has also made him became self-conscious of his appearance. After complaining of intense stomach pain last month he was eventually taken to the hospital where doctors finally caught on to the cause for his pain. Foetus-in-fetu is said to only occur in only 1 out of 500,000 births. The last recorded case of the condition was of a 36-year-old man in India back in 1999. - mD |||||","completion":"There was once a teenage boy in Malaysia who had a very strange tummy.

To break it down: 1. \\"Hace 3 meses\\" is Spanish for \\"3 months ago\\". In Spanish, \\"hace\\" is used to express the amount of time that has passed since an event occurred. This is different from English where we would typically put \\"ago\\" after the time phrase.

Importantly, in Spanish, the name of the cities, countries and other geographic names are pronounced in a way that is as close as possible to the language these belong to. 3. \\"Hombre\\" translates to \\"Male\\" in English. This is a category often used when sorting data or specifying personal information such as gender. Therefore, if this phrase was being used to label some data, perhaps on a demographic survey or a user profile, it would indicate that the information relates to a male individual who lived in Chicago 3 months ago or that the information was from 3 months ago from a male in Chicago.

It didn't take long to find them. As the Royal Navy ship lowered her landing craft to begin rescuing the first three boats filled with migrants, reports were coming in of more on route from Libya. The first boat we saw illustrated their desperation to reach Europe. A small wooden vessel was packed with around 400 people. There was barely any room to move on deck. Below, another load of migrants had been loaded like cargo. They were drifting without an engine, just hoping for salvation. It would have needed a miracle for that boat to complete the journey to Europe. Nearby Bulwark's crew were also coming to the rescue of two perilous rubber dinghies, each carrying around a hundred more people. The fact that many didn't even have life jackets was another reminder that the gangs who trafficked them had little regard for their lives. In Bulwark's docking bay we watched wave after wave of landing craft arrive, each full with another load of people. The injured were among the first to be offloaded. We watched as a women was stretchered off - she was pregnant and suffering from dehydration. For most their only belongings were the clothes they were wearing. They were marshalled to an area to be processed. First they were searched to ensure none was carrying any weapons. Then they were asked to give their names and the countries they came from. They had travelled from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and sub-Saharan Africa. There were Syrians who had fled one civil war only to find another in Libya. After they had been given some food and water, we spoke to them about their journey. They told us that they had paid around 1,000 (Â£650) to the gangs who had smuggled them. Many had come to Libya to find work but as the country descended into chaos they found they were the victims of discrimination. Tor, a Christian man from South Sudan, said he'd been victimised because he didn't have a Muslim name. He broke down in tears when I asked him about the family he had left behind. He claimed as well that some of the people involved in the smuggling had also been rescued. Moussa from Ghana, who was just 17, said he had been beaten by the people who trafficked him. Whatever the reasons that had taken them to Libya, they all agreed that it was now too dangerous to stay. They were making the journey to Europe because they thought it was their only hope. Esaw, another man from Ghana, told me that he wasn't even expecting to survive the journey. By the end of the day Bulwark and her crew had taken on board 1,200 people with the ship declared in \\"overload\\" conditions. Some survivors were taken onto the upper open decks, because there wasn't enough room below to accommodate them. In the words of Bulwark's captain this \\"may well be the tip of the iceberg\\". This is supported by some estimates that say there are already half a million people waiting to make the same journey. The captain can't be sure they picked up everyone at sea on this day. All he can say is that Bulwark and her crew have done all they can to bring as many as possible to safety. The Royal Navy ship is now on her way to Sicily to hand the migrants over to the Italian authorities. But soon Bulwark will set sail again to look for the next wave coming in.

Percy Tyrone Sledge (November 25, 1940 - April 14, 2015) was an American R&B, soul and gospel singer. He is best known for the song \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\", a No. 1 hit on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B singles charts in 1966. It was awarded a million-selling, Gold-certified disc from the RIAA. Having previously worked as a hospital orderly in the early 1960s, Sledge achieved his strongest success in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a series of emotional soul songs. Sledge's career enjoyed a renaissance in the 1980s when \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" re-entered the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 2 behind the reissued Ben E. King classic \\"Stand by Me\\", after being used in a Levi's commercial. In the early 1990s, Michael Bolton brought \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" back into the limelight again on his hit album Time, Love, & Tenderness. On the week of November 17 to November 23, 1991, Bolton's version also hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, exactly 25 1/2 years to the week after Percy's did in 1966. In 1994, Saul Davis and Barry Goldberg produced Sledge's album, Blue Night, for Philippe Le Bras' Sky Ranch label and Virgin Records. It featured Bobby Womack, Steve Cropper, and Mick Taylor among others. Blue Night received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Blues Album, Vocal or Instrumental, and in 1996 it won the W.C. Handy Award for best soul or blues album. In 2004, Davis and Goldberg also produced the Shining Through the Rain album, which preceded his induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Songs on the CD were written by Mikael Rickfors, Steve Earle, the Bee Gees, Carla Olson, Denny Freeman, Allan Clarke and Jackie Lomax. The same year Percy recorded a live album with his band Sunset Drive entitled Percy Sledge and Sunset Drive - Live in Virginia on WRM Records produced by Warren Rodgers. In May 2007, Percy was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame in his home city of Baton Rouge, LA. In December 2010, Rhino Handmade issued a four-CD retrospective, The Atlantic Recordings, which covers all of the issued Atlantic masters, as well as many of the tracks unissued in the United States (although some were simply the mono versions of songs originally issued in stereo; Disc 1 comprises Sledge's first two LPs which were not recorded on stereo equipment).

Recently, he changed job and now working as a financial analyst for another company, company B. Company B has completely different culture than company A. Company B is mostly financed by equity. But I can use this background: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2] An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.

The tax benefits of debt come from the fact that interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, which reduces a company's taxable income. Since Company B has a lower amount of debt in its capital structure, the tax benefits it receives from debt would be smaller compared to a company with a higher proportion of debt financing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Only 14 per cent see officers on daily basis. Results in spite of PCSO 'Blunkett bobbies' introduced to boost police visibility. Article:","completion":"Title: Home Office Survey Reveals Decline in Police Visibility Despite PCSO Initiation Introduction In a recent Home Office survey involving 50,000 participants, it was revealed that only 14 per cent of the respondents claimed to see police officers on a daily basis. This comes as a cause for concern, considering the introduction of the Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) scheme, known as 'Blunkett bobbies,' which aimed to boost police visibility on the streets. This article explores the factors underlying this development and its potential implications for public safety as well as trust in law enforcement agencies. Background: The Introduction of PCSOs In the early 2000s, the British government introduced the PCSO initiative, also known as 'Blunkett bobbies,' named after David Blunkett, the then Home Secretary. The main goal of this scheme was to enhance police visibility and presence within neighborhoods across the country, thereby promoting public safety and fostering trust between the police and the communities they serve. Over the years, thousands of PCSOs have been employed to work alongside traditional police officers in various jurisdictions. The Home Office Survey Findings According to the recent study commissioned by the Home Office, only a fraction of respondents (14%) reported seeing police officers on a daily basis. Considering the goals of the PCSO initiative, these findings have raised multiple questions and concerns among citizens and law enforcement agencies. Several factors might have contributed to this decline in police visibility. The most obvious one is the significant reduction in the overall number of frontline police officers across the country in the past decade. This decline has put pressure on the remaining officers, forcing them to focus on attending to more critical incidents and investigations, leaving less time for regular patrols or public engagement. Another factor affecting police visibility might be the shift in policing strategies in recent years with the emergence of new technologies. Many law enforcement agencies are adopting data-driven and intelligence-led policing models, which focus on identifying and addressing the root causes of criminal activities. This approach might limit the physical presence of officers on the streets since they spend more time analyzing information and identifying trends. Implications of Reduced Police Visibility Decreased visibility of police officers has multiple consequences for both the public and the law enforcement agencies. Firstly, it can negatively impact the community's perception of police effectiveness and trust in their ability to maintain public safety. A diminishing police presence on the streets might create the impression that crime levels are on the rise, increasing fear among citizens, and potentially leading to a decline in public confidence in the police department. Secondly, reduced police visibility might hamper the flow of information from the public to the police. When officers are regularly seen walking the beat or patrolling neighborhoods in their vehicles, community members are more likely to approach them with useful information, which can be vital in preventing or solving crimes. This interaction between the police and the public can be an invaluable tool that might be hindered by decreased police presence. Conclusion The findings of the Home Office survey point out an alarming reduction in police visibility, despite the implementation of the PCSO initiative. This development calls for a critical evaluation of the policing strategies and resource allocation to ensure that communities continue to benefit from an accessible, present, and effective police force. Law enforcement agencies should explore innovative ways to maintain and enhance their visibility through the use of technology, such as deploying CCTV cameras, utilizing social media to engage with the public, and investing in community policing programs that build trust and collaboration. These efforts will be crucial to restoring public confidence and ensuring safety in our neighborhoods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: - Rain picks up carbon dioxide as it falls to earth - The rain falls on the soil over the limestone - The carbon dioxide in the rain washes through the soil - The carbon dioxide turns into acid - The acid in the rain gets to the limestone below the soil - The acid dissolves the limestone - Acid continues to erode the limestone with more rain over time - The eroded limestone sometimes forms caves. What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The first step of the process is the rain picking up carbon dioxide as it falls to earth. When rain forms in the atmosphere, it interacts with various gases, including carbon dioxide. In this interaction, carbon dioxide gets dissolved in the rainwater and forms a weak carbonic acid (H2CO3). This weak acid is what gives the rain its mildly acidic nature. Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, and its concentration has been significantly increasing due to various human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Consequently, the amount of carbon dioxide being dissolved in the rainwater has also increased, leading to a mild increase in the acidity of rain. This phenomenon, commonly known as \\"acid rain,\\" has various environmental implications, including the weathering and erosion of limestone rocks. As rainwater carrying dissolved carbon dioxide makes its way through soil and reaches the underlying limestone rock, the dissolved carbonic acid reacts with calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is the primary mineral constituent of limestone. This reaction results in the dissolution and subsequent erosion of the limestone rock. Over time, the continuous erosion of limestone by acid rain leads to the formation of various geological features, such as caves, sinkholes, and underground drainage systems. In conclusion, the first step in the process of limestone erosion due to acid rain is the formation of carbonic acid in rainwater, which occurs when rain picks up carbon dioxide as it falls to the earth. This weak acid then initiates the chain of events leading to the erosion of limestone rocks and the eventual formation of caves and other unique geological features."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: the brain is what Context: The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.

PUBLISHED:. 17:28 EST, 1 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:57 EST, 2 November 2013. A pet rabbit has apparently become the latest victim of false widow spiders. Only hours earlier one-year-old Molly had been hopping happily around the garden. But she was found dead in her hutch after it was infested by the poisonous creatures. Recently false widow spiders have put several people in hospital after biting them and even caused a school to be closed temporarily. Victim: The body of the pet rabbit, called Molly, was found next to a spider's web with five false widows crawling around. Molly’s owner Samantha Davies found her dead when she went to feed her two rabbits, Molly and Milly. When the 21-year-old removed Molly’s body, she found a hammock-shaped web and up to five spiders scuttling around the hutch. After using the internet to identify them as false widows, Miss Davies became worried for the safety of her 18-month-old daughter, Rosie. She contacted her local environmental health department in the hope of having her home treated for infestation. Her request was declined, but an officer told her he was 98 per cent certain the spider was responsible for Molly’s death. Yesterday Miss Davies, a kitchen assistant, said: ‘We couldn’t believe it when we saw the spiders. I was really upset when Molly died. Devastated: Samantha Davies, 21, pictured with her 18-month-old daughter Rosie and partner Scott Barnes, was told by an environmental health officer he was 98 per cent certain the pet's death was caused by the spiders. ‘I really didn’t want the spiders around my daughter. We asked environmental health if they could help us, but they refused. ‘If it had been a rat, they would have done something, but not with poisonous spiders.’ Miss Davies, who lives with her partner Scott Barnes and their daughter in Mountain Ash, South Wales, has since disinfected the hutch where Milly still lives, and killed the spiders she found last weekend. Venomous: The false widow spider has caused a school to be closed and has left people with horrific injuries after the attack in recent weeks. The false widow is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known to be in Britain and cases of people being bitten by the venomous creature have been on the rise. John Catlin, 66, from Bromley, Kent, is still recovering a year after a bite that caused his organs to start shutting down. Bodybuilder Gary Meadows from Teesville, Middlesbrough, required a skin graft when he was bitten in 2011 and has suffered severe reactions to any insect bite since. Layla Benton, 14, was off school for three weeks after her knee swelled up when she was bitten in her bathroom in Basildon, Essex. And last month Dean Academy in Lydney, Gloucestershire, had to close its doors to pupils after the dangerous spiders were found there. The spiders are shiny and black with distinctive cream markings on the abdomen that resemble a horseshoe – or, to some eyes, a skull. They have long, spindly legs and are easily confused with the black widow, a far more venomous cousin not found in Britain. As with most species of spider, it is the female false widow which is the force to be reckoned with. Males tend not to grow much bigger than two centimetres, while females reach up to three centimetres. The first false widow is thought to have come to Britain from the Canary Islands or Madeira in the 1870s in a bunch of bananas. The first recorded sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879.

But late in the quarter, Akers had a 34-yard field goal attempt blocked by Carlos Dunlap, which the Bengals returned all the way to the Lions 40 yard line despite fumbling during the return. That set up a 12-yard TD strike from Andy Dalton to Marvin Jones just before the first half closed, giving Cincinnati a 14-10 lead. The teams exchanged TD passes in the third quarter. First, Dalton hit Tyler Eifert for a 32-yard TD, and Stafford followed shortly after with a 27-yard TD toss to Calvin Johnson. Mike Nugent connected on a 48-yard field goal late in the third to put the Bengals up 24-17.

Malaysia's police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, said an examination of the simulator, taken from the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, showed its data log had been cleared on February 3, more than a month before the airliner, carrying 239 people, disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. \\"The experts are looking at what are the logs that have been cleared,\\" he told a news conference. No wreckage has been found from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8 (1721 GMT March 7), less than an hour after taking off. Malaysia has now made available to the FBI electronic data generated by both pilots of Flight MH370, including data from a hard drive attached to the captain's flight simulator, and from electronic media used by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. The official said he could not confirm that some data had been wiped from the simulator and stressed that there was no guarantee the FBI analysis would turn up any fresh clues. U.S. investigators had become increasingly frustrated in recent days that Malaysian authorities had not asked them for more help. The FBI has extensive experience investigating airplane crashes, including those of TWA 800 and EgyptAir 990 off the U.S. east coast in the 1990s and Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. In the case of EgyptAir 990, the FBI helped air safety investigators establish that the crash was caused by a suicidal co-pilot, while in the case of Pan Am 103, the agency worked with British and U.S. intelligence to build a case against the government of Libya. In Kuala Lumpur, at the headquarters of a search operation that has so far turned up few leads, Chinese relatives' anger over sparse information on the fate of their relatives sparked chaotic scenes on Wednesday. Malaysia's transport minister ordered an inquiry after security guards carried out the distraught mother of a passenger from a briefing room where she had protested about a lack of transparency. \\"They are just saying wait for information. Wait for information. We don't know how long we have to wait,\\" cried the woman before being whisked away from a massive media scrum. Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said he regretted the anguish. \\"Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing,\\" he said in a statement. DWINDLING HOPES Prospects that a 26-nation operation would lead to quick results appeared to be dwindling, however, as investigators confirmed they were focusing on the remote southern Indian Ocean after failing to find any traces of the jet further north. \\"Our top priority is being given to that area,\\" Hishammuddin told the news conference, confirming an earlier Reuters report. Australia is leading the search in the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the U.S. Navy. It has shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but it still covers an area of 600,000 sq km (230,000 sq miles), roughly the size of Spain and Portugal. The unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER had focused on two vast search corridors: one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia's Sumatra island to west of Australia. \\"The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,\\" said a source close to the investigation. That view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane entered their airspace, and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor. Some sources involved in the investigation have voiced fears it could stall due to the reluctance of countries in the region to share militarily sensitive radar data that might shed new light on the direction the jet took. Two people familiar with the investigation said the search had been hampered in some cases by delays over the paperwork needed to allow foreign maritime surveillance aircraft into territorial waters without a formal diplomatic request. \\"These are basically spy planes; that's what they were designed for,\\" said one source close to the investigation, explaining the hesitance of some nations to give blanket permission for other countries to scour their waters. Hishammuddin confirmed that some assets that could be involved in the search were waiting for diplomatic clearance. \\"The search for MH370 involves diplomatic, technical and logistical challenges,\\" he told the news conference, held in a Kuala Lumpur airport hotel that has served as a temporary crisis coordination centre and a base for dozens of news organizations. DELIBERATELY DIVERTED Malaysian and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course, but an exhaustive background search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that might explain why. If the plane did indeed end up in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the remotest places on Earth and also one of the deepest seas, it increases the chance it may never be found - and investigators may never know for sure what happened on board. Officials believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777 and commercial aviation navigation switched off two vital datalinks: the ACARS system, which relays maintenance data back to the ground, and the transponder, which enables the plane to be seen by civilian radar. U.S. agencies have looked for evidence that anyone other than the pilots knew how disable ACARS but have found nothing.

Marks, the spokesman for the United States Navy Seventh Fleet, which has helped oversee the American military contribution to the search for the missing plane, said in a brief email on Thursday that he had not heard word of finding any objects possibly from the aircraft. On Wednesday, Commander Marks said, “If suspect debris were spotted, the aircraft would more than likely use the EO/IR camera at close range to identify exactly what was detected.” He was referring to a camera with electro-optical and infrared functions that can discern objects much more sharply than a naked human eye. The aircraft, he added, “could provide the necessary information to lead salvage ships to the wreckage.” Photo As the possible break in what had been a fruitless search was being pursued, the Malaysian authorities were seeking help from the F.B.I. to help retrieve deleted computer data from a homemade flight simulator belonging to the captain of the Malaysia Airlines jet that vanished 11 days ago, their first request for high-level American assistance in solving the mystery of the missing plane. Malaysian and American investigators are homing in on the pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and his first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, though they have not excluded different possibilities.

Video “Right now, it’s the best chance we have of finding something,” the law enforcement official said. Unless the pilot used very sophisticated technology to erase files, he added, the F.B.I. will most likely be able to recover them. Advertisement Continue reading the main story More than two dozen nations are searching for any trace of the missing airliner, a challenge that has seemed to grow more complicated and more contentious with each passing day. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the geographic scope of the search has widened, Australia as well as China, India, France, the United States and other nations have offered naval ships, surveillance planes, satellites and experts to Malaysia, which is leading the effort. The investigators face a formidable set of mechanical, avionic and satellite communication puzzles. Flight 370 was about 40 minutes into a six-hour trip to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, early on March 8 when it suddenly stopped communicating with air traffic controllers and turned far off course, cutting back across peninsular Malaysia, over the Strait of Malacca and toward the Indian Ocean. Military radar tracked it for a while, but the operators did not seek to identify the plane or alert anyone. A satellite over the ocean picked up automated signals for several more hours — facts not released publicly for days after the plane vanished. Tracking Flight 370 The sequence of events known by the authorities, in local times. Mar. 8, 2014 00:41 AM A Boeing 777-200 operated by Malaysia Airlines leaves Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing with 227 passengers, of which two-thirds are Chinese, and a Malaysian crew of 12. Mar. 8, 2014 01:07 AM The airplane's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or Acars, which transmits data about the plane's performance, sends a transmission. It is not due to transmit again for a half-hour. Mar. 8, 2014 01:19 AM The cockpit crew acknowledges a message from ground control, saying, \\"Good night Malaysian three seven zero.\\" No further voice messages are received from the plane. Mar. 8, 2014 01:21 AM Two minutes after the last voice transmission, the plane's transponder, which signals its identity, altitude and speed to other aircraft and to monitors on the ground, is shut off or fails. Detecting a Plane Mar. 8, 2014 01:37 AM The Acars system fails to send its scheduled signal, indicating that it has been shut off or has failed sometime in the past half-hour. Mar. 8, 2014 02:15 AM An unidentified plane flying westward is detected by military radar. It ascends to 45,000 feet, above the approved limit for a Boeing 777, then descends unevenly to 23,000 feet and eventually flies out over the Indian Ocean. Investigators later conclude that it was Flight 370. It was last plotted 200 miles northwest of Panang. Q. and A. Mar. 8, 2014 06:30 AM By now Flight 370 was scheduled to have landed in Beijing. Mar. 8, 2014 07:24 AM Malaysia Airlines announces that it has lost contact with the aircraft. Mar. 8, 2014 08:11 AM The last complete signal is received from an automated satellite system on the plane, suggesting that it was still intact and flying. The Malaysian authorities say the jet had enough fuel to keep flying for perhaps a half-hour after this. Search Area Expanded Mar. 8, 2014 08:19 AM Inmarsat, a satellite communications company, says an incomplete signal representing a “partial handshake\\" may have been received. Further analysis of satellite data confirms that the jet went down in the southern Indian Ocean. Mar. 15, 2014 00:00 AM The Malaysian authorities say the investigation has become a criminal matter because the jet appears to have been deliberately diverted. The plane's first turn off course, to the west, was executed using an onboard computer, probably programmed by someone with knowledge of aircraft systems. The authorities say two passengers were Iranians who boarded using stolen European passports, but no links to terrorist groups are found. The satellite “pings” led investigators to conclude that the plane had made its way to some point along one of two long, arcing corridors that together embrace 2.24 million square nautical miles of sea and land.

In the same hotel meeting room where Malaysian officials have tried each day to maintain a tone of calm resolve while briefing reporters, several protesters unfurled a banner that read: “We oppose the Malaysian government concealing the truth. Delaying time for saving lives.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story “All our feelings are the same: We demand to know the truth,” said Xu Dengwang, one of the protesters. Security guards soon ejected them from the room. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Investigators have said the plane’s extraordinary diversion from its intended course was probably carried out by someone who had aviation experience. The Malaysian police, who found that Mr. Zaharie had built a flight simulator at his home, said Wednesday that some data had been erased from the simulator on Feb. 3, more than a month before the ill-fated flight. Evidence suggests that whoever diverted the plane knew how to disable its communications systems and program course changes, and the data recorded in the pilot’s flight simulator may shed light on whether he was involved. But building and using flight simulators at home is a popular hobby among aviation enthusiasts, and the deletion of data from Mr. Zaharie’s simulator may have been routine housekeeping. Mr. Zaharie did not keep his simulator a secret: He posted a video on YouTube more than a year ago showing him sitting in front of it. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The computer search could reveal impulses or plans linked to the plane’s disappearance. But the investigators could also conclude that Mr. Zaharie deleted files just as the average person does to clean out a computer. ||||| Story highlights Australian Prime Minister says two objects are seen in the southern Indian Ocean An Australian air force plane is attempting a closer inspection, Australian media report President Barack Obama says search for Flight 370 is ''a top priority'' No information of significance has so far been found on any passengers, authorities say Authorities have spotted two objects in the Indian Ocean that are possibly related to the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Thursday. \\"New and credible information has come to light in relation to the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean,\\" Abbott said in the the Australian House of Representatives in Canberra. \\"The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has received information based on satellite imagery of objects possibly related to the search. \\"Following specialist analysis of this satellite imagery, two possible objects related to the search have been identified,\\" he said. \\"I can inform the House that a Royal Australian Air Force Orion has been diverted to attempt to locate the objects.\\" Three other planes will carry out a \\"more intensive follow-up search,\\" he said. Australian search teams have been at the forefront of the hunt for the missing plane in the remote southern Indian Ocean. The announcement from Abbott raises hopes of finding parts of the plane after a huge search that is now in its 13th day. Previous reports of debris found in the sea have not turned out to be related to the passenger jet, which vanished over Southeast Asia earlier this month. But those reports came before the search area was massively expanded into two large arcs, one that heads northwest into Asia, the other southwest into the Indian Ocean. The Malaysian military is checking the new information from Australian authorities, a source close to the investigation told CNN. \\"Verification might take some time. It is very far and it will take some time to locate and verify the objects,\\" the source said. Malaysia's Acting Transportation Secretary Hishammuddin Hussein said Abbott had informed Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak of the development Thursday. \\"At this stage, Australian officials have yet to establish whether these objects are indeed related to the search for MH370,\\" Hishammuddin said. Other pieces of information related to the investigation into the plane's disappearance had emerged Wednesday. Flight simulator probed Investigators looking at the flight simulator taken from the home of Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the pilot of the plane, have discovered that some data had been deleted from it, Hishammuddin said at a news conference. What the revelation means is unclear. It could be another dead end in an investigation that has been full of them so far, or it could provide further evidence for the theory that one or more of the flight crew may have been involved in the plane's disappearance 12 days ago. \\"It may not tell us anything. It's a step in the process,\\" one U.S. law enforcement source told CNN. \\"It could be a very insignificant detail in the process.\\" Investigators have been looking into the background of all 239 passengers and crew members aboard the plane that vanished in the early morning hours of March 8 while en route from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Particular attention has focused on the pilot and first officer on Flight 370, but authorities have yet to come up with any evidence explaining why either of them would have taken the jetliner off course. Hishammuddin didn't say what had been deleted, but simulation programs can store data from previous sessions for later playback. He also did not say who might have deleted the data. FBI examination Specialists are examining the simulator in hopes of recovering the data that was deleted, Hishammuddin said.

The FBI examination of the computer drives involves sorting through a large volume of data, according to a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation. \\"It is going to take some period of time, but we are analyzing it with a great degree of urgency. It is prioritized right at the top because the world is trying to figure this out,\\" the official said on condition of anonymity. Deleted files from Shah's simulator could reveal it had been used to practice diverting the plane and flying it to an unfamiliar airport, experts said. But even if investigators retrieve past simulations showing that Zaharie practiced flying to seemingly odd locations, that doesn't necessarily indicate evidence of anything nefarious, said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. \\"You put in strange airports and try to land there, just to see if you can do it,\\" said Schiavo, adding that she sometimes does just that on the flight simulation program on her home computer. 'Grasping at straws' President Barack Obama called the search for Flight 370 \\"a top priority,\\" telling KDFW of Dallas on Wednesday that the United States will keep working on it. \\"We have put every resource that we have available at the disposal of the search process,\\" he said. But beyond help with the computer drives, the Malaysian government has not put in a formal request for additional FBI help overseas, according to the senior U.S. official. \\"We have made it clear we are ready to provide help whenever they need it,\\" the official said. \\"We are grasping at straws. No one is running on anything white hot.\\" More than 60 ships and 50 aircraft are participating in the search. But at least two aircraft, a Japanese search plane and a U.S. Navy P-3 Orion, sat on a runway at a Subang air base this week after Indonesia refused to allow the planes to fly through its airspace. \\"From what I understand, this is an international operation,\\" Cmdr. William Marks, spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet, told CNN by telephone. \\"...I'm confident we're going to be flying today or very soon.\\" Later, Indonesia's military spokesman told CNN clearance was given to all search planes. Although the search area spans nearly 3 million square miles, a U.S. government official familiar with the investigation said the missing plane is most likely somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. \\"This is an area out of normal shipping lanes, out of any commercial flight patterns, with few fishing boats, and there are no islands,\\" the official said, warning that the search could well last \\"weeks and not days.\\" Angry families want answers The lack of progress has angered and frustrated families, who have accused Malaysian officials of withholding information. Some family members staged a protest at the Kuala Lumpur hotel where media covering the search are staying. Their efforts were cut short by security guards who removed them through a crush of reporters, dragging one as she screamed.

They gather daily for a briefing with officials. Ye Lun, whose brother-in-law is on the missing plane, says every day is the same. He and his group leave the hotel in the morning for a daily briefing, and that's it. They go back to the hotel to watch the news on television. In a statement, Hishammuddin said Malaysian authorities \\"regret the scenes at this afternoon's press conference.\\" \\"One can only imagine the anguish they are going through,\\" he said of the families. \\"Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing.\\" An abrupt change in direction The disappearance continues to intrigue the public and frustrate officials, who have turned up no sign of the plane despite the involvement of teams from 26 nations. On Tuesday, a law enforcement official told CNN that the aircraft's first major change of course -- an abrupt westward turn that took the plane off its route to China and back across the Malay Peninsula -- was almost certainly programmed by somebody in the cockpit. The change was entered into the plane's system at least 12 minutes before a person in the cockpit, believed to be the co-pilot, signed off to air traffic controllers. Two minutes after the signoff, the plane's transponder stopped communicating details about the plane's altitude, speed and heading. Some experts said the change in direction could have been part of an alternate flight plan programmed in advance in case of emergency; others suggested it could show something more nefarious was afoot. But Hishammuddin said Wednesday that \\"there is no additional waypoint on MH370's documented flight plan, which depicts normal routing all the way to Beijing.\\" The Thai military, meanwhile, said it had spotted the plane turning west toward the Strait of Malacca early on March 8. That supports the analysis of Malaysian military radar that has the plane flying out over the Strait of Malacca and into the Indian Ocean. But it didn't make it any clearer where the plane went next. Authorities say information from satellites suggests the plane kept flying for about six hours after it was last detected by Malaysian military radar. Malaysian authorities, who are coordinating the search, say the available evidence suggests the missing plane flew off course in a deliberate act by someone who knew what they were doing.

They've received background checks for all passengers on board, with the exception of those from Russia and Ukraine, Hishammuddin said. So far, no information of significance has been found about any passengers, Hishammuddin said. China says it has found nothing suspicious during background checks on its citizens on the flight -- a large majority of the plane's passengers. And some experts have warned against hastily jumping to conclusions about the role of the pilots. \\"I've worked on many cases were the pilots were suspect, and it turned out to be a mechanical and horrible problem,\\" said Schiavo. \\"And I have a saying myself: Sometimes, an erratic flight path is heroism, not terrorism.\\" Ticking clock Searchers are racing the clock in their efforts to find the plane and its flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders. The devices have batteries designed to send out pings for 30 days. That leaves 18 days until the batteries are expected to run out. The task is being complicated by the scope of the search area, as well as the depth of some of the waters being searched -- up to 23,000 feet (7,000 meters). Searchers trying to find and retrieve wreckage and bodies from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, had to use unmanned submarines. It took nearly two years to find the bulk of the wreckage, including the flight data recorders, in waters nearly 12,000 feet deep. It took even longer to determine what happened to the plane. ||||| Summary:","completion":"An extensive investigation into the missing Malaysian airliner, flight MH370, is ongoing.

Review: Well, what can you say about sitcoms. There often quite lame, morale dedicative, and just plain. So is this show! It got a boring cast, although A.Bynes is okej in her perky way, the rest is just stereotypical crap....as always. We have all seen it before, and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled. Cause, lets face it, its a mediocre and self righteous show. As the most sitcoms are.... Well, in short. If you wanna see some good entertainment, you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror. Do some faces and move on.... Its more entertaining than this show! Now, what is this review like? Possible answers: [+] negative. [+] positive.","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the sentiment of the review. The review contains negative words and phrases like \\"lame\\", \\"mediocre\\", \\"boring cast\\", \\"stereotypical crap\\", and \\"self-righteous\\". This indicates that the reviewer is not giving a positive opinion on the sitcom. Step 2: List reasons for the sentiment. The reviewer states that the sitcom is: 1. Boring: The cast is not engaging and it uses stereotypical characters and situations. 2. Mediocre: It doesn't provide any unique or interesting content. 3. Self-righteous: The sitcom may try to push various morals in a patronizing way. Step 3: Determine any positive aspects. Amanda Bynes is mentioned to be \\"okej\\" in her perky way, indicating that she might be the only positive aspect in the show according to the reviewer. Step 4: Summarize the review. The review is negative toward the sitcom, mainly for its lack of originality and engaging plotlines, as well as its overuse of stereotypes. The reviewer considers Amanda Bynes to be an acceptable part of the show, but overall would not recommend it as an entertaining experience. The answer is: [+] negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. One day Einstein is walking in a street in New York .

A) buys a new one B) becomes a great scientist C) still wears the old clothes D) Both B and C","completion":"D) Both B and C Over the years, Einstein goes through different phases of his life. At first, when nobody knows him in New York, he is comfortable wearing his old coat. He believes that since nobody knows him, it doesn't matter what he wears. However, as time passes and he makes significant contributions to the field of science, he becomes a globally renowned scientist – a transformation that highlights option B. But even with this newfound fame, Einstein’s mindset towards his coat remains more or less the same. Though he is aware of his recognition and the expectations people have of him, he still doesn't see the need to buy a new coat. He believes that since everyone knows who he is, it shouldn't matter what he wears. This idea reflects option C. Additionally, the story of Einstein and the old coat could also be seen as an allegory for his general attitude towards materialism. For Einstein, the pursuit of knowledge and understanding the world around him held more importance than superficial appearances or possessions. Hence, his reluctance to replace his old coat illustrates his preference to focus on his work and research rather than on materialistic endeavors. In conclusion, as Einstein becomes a great scientist (option B), he still continues to wear his old clothes, specifically the old coat (option C). Hence, the answer is D) Both B and C."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Information: - The Marxophone is a fretless zither with a system of metal hammers added for ease of playing . It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major ( middle C to C '' ) , and four sets of chord strings ( C major , G major , F major , and D7 ) . Sounding somewhat like a mandolin , the Marxophone 's timbre is also reminiscent of various types of hammered dulcimers . The player typically strums the chords with the left hand . The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings . A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note . Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings , which produces a mandolin - like tremolo . The bounce rate is somewhat fixed , as it is based on the spring steel strip length , hammer weight , and string tension -- but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip , effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer . Numerically coded sheet music prepared specifically for the Marxophone indicates when and in what order to play melody and chord strings . This type of music , similar to tablature , was produced for those who could not read standard notation . A rectangular piece of metal provides a backstop for the spring steel hammers , displays the name Marxophone and the patent number , and has clips that hold sheet music . It also marks the 15 keys by letter ( C , D , etc. ) , by number ( 1 - 15 ) and in standard musical notation . When the instrument is moved or stored , the metal rectangle bends down , holding the keys against the strings , so the Marxophone can fit into its case -- which is the size of a large briefcase . - A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a stringed instrument. For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a pick, and is a separate tool held in the player's hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat, B. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins. - Lute can refer generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the HornbostelSachs system), more specifically to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes. - In music, unison is two or more musical parts sounding the same pitch or at an octave interval, usually at the same time. - C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps. - The harp is a stringed musical instrument which has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the fingers. Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3500 BC. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. While some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Burma and in Sub-Saharan Africa, while other defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been revived by musicians in the modern era. - The mandocello is a plucked string instrument of the mandolin family. It has eight strings in four paired courses, tuned in fifths like a mandolin, but is larger, and tuned CC-GG-dd-aa (low to high in pitch). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin. - G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Its key signature has one sharp, F. - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\". - The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \\"octavus\\", the eighth). - In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp, flat, and rarely, natural symbols placed together on the staff. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline. - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola. - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians. What object entity has the relation of 'subclass of' with the subject 'marxophone'?

The chytrids are the simplest and most primitive Eumycota, or true fungi. The evolutionary record shows that the first recognizable chytrids appeared during the late preCambrian period, more than 500 million years ago. Like all fungi, chytrids have chitin in their cell walls, but one group of chytrids has both cellulose and chitin in the cell wall. Most chytrids are unicellular; a few form multicellular organisms and hyphae, which have no septa between cells (coenocytic). They produce gametes and diploid zoospores that swim with the help of a single flagellum. The ecological habitat and cell structure of chytrids have much in common with protists. Chytrids usually live in aquatic environments, although some species live on land. Some species thrive as parasites on plants, insects, or amphibians (Figure 24.10), while others are saprobes. The chytrid species Allomyces is well characterized as an experimental organism. Its reproductive cycle includes both asexual and sexual phases.

Lottery officials released the winning numbers for the largest multistate Powerball jackpot: 22, 10,13,14, 52, and the Powerball number is 11. One winning ticket was sold at a Publix supermarket in Zephyrhills, Florida, according to David Bishop, deputy secretary of the Florida lottery. Saturday's jackpot is a record 590.5 million. It marks the largest in Powerball history, surpassing a 587.6 million jackpot split by winners in Arizona and Missouri in November. The jackpot has a cash value of 376.9 million. \\"I buy mine here all the time. Yesterday, I was in Naples. I bought it in Naples, That's just my luck,\\" Butch Gonzalez, a regular lottery player, told CNN affiliate Bay News 9 outside the Publix in Zephyrhills. \\"I just hope whoever won really needs the money, and I hope they do right by it,\\" he said. The largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history was 656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. That was split among three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. If there had been no winner in Saturday's Powerball, the jackpot would have shot up to 925 million for Wednesday's drawing, according to Kelly Cripe, spokeswoman for the Texas Lottery, which is part of the Powerball game. Powerball is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A single ticket costs 2, and the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175,223,510. Why you keep playing the lottery. Hate to break it to you, but you stand a better chance of walking onto the golf course and hitting two consecutive holes in one than winning the jackpot. But that didn't stop hundreds from driving to the Trex Mart in Dearborn, Missouri, where one of two winning tickets was sold in last year's 587 million Powerball drawing. About 100 people an hour were buying tickets at the store. At a convenience store in Riverside, Missouri, Jim Mansell said he was buying only one ticket. \\"I figure if the good Lord intends you to win, you only need one ticket,\\" he told CNN affiliate KCTV5. \\"But I don't know if the good Lord believes in gambling or not.\\" In Florida, winners must claim prizes at a state lottery retailer or lottery district office on or before the 180th day after the drawing. Any Powerball retailer in the state can validate a winning ticket. CNN's Scott Thompson and Jake Carpenter contributed to the report. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Iwasaki's careful respect for the Long Beach program and its lawyers earned him the political capital he needed to complete his takeover in a matter of weeks. \\"The Long Beach program had strong support in the community so in a situation like that, one has to recognize that it's not like a takeover where I have all the answers and I know best,\\" Iwasaki said. \\"The people in the community who are working there have the contacts and the knowledge that will allow service to continue.\\" Things have gone less smoothly across town. There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes. Personalities got involved when they shouldn't have. Things were said that caused bad feelings and couldn't be unsaid.\\" Iwasaki's merger with the smaller, 48-year-old Long Beach program was friendly and fast, and no one - not even Long Beach board members - lost a job.

The book, which delves into Pietersen's cricketing career and personal experiences, sheds light on the darker side of English cricket and has raised eyebrows amongst fans, players, and administrators alike. Adding more fuel to the fire is a dossier of information on Pietersen put together by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The document, leaked on Tuesday, alleges that Pietersen disobeyed then-coach Andy Flower's instructions ahead of the second Test. According to the dossier, Pietersen took two young players out drinking until late, defying Flower's orders. In response to these allegations, Pietersen has vehemently defended himself, stating, \\"My character has been assassinated for five or six years by the ECB press machine, but I can go to bed at night and sleep easy.\\" These strong words underscore the tumultuous relationship that Pietersen has had with the ECB and the English national team. The unveiling of the autobiography at a picturesque Franciscan monastery only added to the drama surrounding the launch. The choice of the venue and the significant revelations in the book have together given rise to speculation about Pietersen's intentions and the larger implications of this extraordinary affair. Pietersen's autobiography has, undoubtedly, lit bonfires around the national team. The book addresses a range of issues that have plagued English cricket in recent years, from the culture of bullying within the dressing room to the inefficiency of the team management. In doing so, Pietersen has opened a Pandora's box that could lead to further repercussions and inquiry into the inner dynamics of the team. The allegations in the leaked dossier have sent shockwaves through the cricketing community. Several former players and experts have weighed in on the ongoing controversy, with opinions ranging from support for Pietersen to outright condemnation. Some argue that Pietersen’s claims of character assassination by the ECB hold water, bearing in mind his impressive record and contributions to the England team. They contend that the organization should be held accountable for its targeted campaign against one of its most prominent players. Others, however, believe that Pietersen's actions, as stated in the dossier, warrant scrutiny and criticism, especially given the responsibilities he had as a senior team member. In conclusion, Kevin Pietersen's new autobiography, the leaked ECB dossier, and the Franciscan monastery launch have together created a perfect storm of controversy in the world of cricket. While Pietersen's character and actions have once again come under the spotlight, the underlying issues he has unearthed have sparked a broader debate about English cricket's management, culture, and performance. With passions running high, the fallout of this episode will be keenly watched and dissected for a long time to come."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(2). Amy put a ring on their finger.","completion":"(2). Amy put a ring on their finger. Amy, who was fortunate enough to not have a cut on her finger, decided that today was the perfect occasion to wear her grandmother's treasured antique ring. Passed down through generations, this ring held a special place in Amy's heart, not only for its beauty but also for the history it represented. The intricately crafted band of yellow gold, adorned with a single shining emerald, was symbolic of her family's love, unity, and strength. As Amy carefully slipped the ring onto her finger, she reflected on her grandmother's stories about the many strong women that had worn it before. Each of these women had faced their own struggles and trials but, at the end of the day, they stayed true to their family roots. The emerald, a distinct choice of gemstone among her ancestors, symbolized growth and new beginnings, guiding each generation forward. Rebecca, intrigued by the shimmering piece of jewelry, gently examined Amy's finger. She delicately traced the delicate engravings along the gold band, in wonderment of the craftsmanship. She became curious about the stories behind the ring and listened attentively as Amy shared her family's tales - the adventures, heartbreaks, and victories. Rebecca, though envious of the beautiful heirloom, felt a sense of vulnerability knowing her own family did not possess such a tradition. Despite this, Amy believed that every family had a story to tell, however unconnected it may be to a physical object. The friendships established, acts of kindness, and sacrifices made—those were the real treasures that connected generations. Sharing these stories with people close to them breathed life into those memories, making them last forever. Amy then suggested to Rebecca that they could start a unique tradition of their own, initiating a legacy to pass down to future generations. One which celebrates the journeys of their families while symbolically intertwining their friendship. The two women spent hours brainstorming and decided on a simple and meaningful idea: a journal. This journal would capture their thoughts, dreams, and journeys so their descendants could relive their lives. The idea brought them closer than ever, as they became active participants in preserving their heritage. Rebecca, who initially felt uneasy about her lack of a family heirloom, embraced her newfound role in creating a legacy. Together, Amy and Rebecca embarked on a journey, with the knowledge that their stories would be treasured by generations to come. As for the ring, it continued to serve as an emblem of their unbreakable bond and the resilient spirits of the women who had worn it before."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"The Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart, also known as the Antifaschistischer Schutzwall in German, was the official name given to the Berlin Wall that separated East and West Berlin from 1961 to 1989. The term \\"Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart\\" was coined by the East German government to justify the construction of the wall and to ostensibly indicate that its purpose was to protect East Germany from alleged fascist elements in West Germany. The construction of the Berlin Wall began on August 13, 1961, under the orders of the East German government led by Walter Ulbricht, the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED). Physically, the wall was a massive concrete barrier, approximately 155 kilometers (96 miles) long, accompanied by various watchtowers, military checkpoints, and a heavily guarded \\"death strip.\\" The construction of the wall was motivated by political, social, and economic factors that arose during the years of the Cold War. The term \\"Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart\\" was intended as a propaganda tool to convince the East German population that the wall was necessary for their security and protection, rather than a measure to prevent them from fleeing to West Germany. By alluding to the shared history of World War II and the fight against Fascism, the East German government tried to create a narrative where the West was painted as the enemy, drawing upon memories of fascism and transforming the wall into a symbol of national defense. In reality, the primary purpose of the Berlin Wall was to prevent East Germans from leaving the country amidst a growing refugee crisis, as thousands of East Germans were crossing into West Berlin in search of better economic opportunities and political freedom. The Communist government in East Germany was struggling both economically and politically, so the wall served as a means to stabilize their situation and to maintain control over the population. The Berlin Wall stood for 28 years and became the iconic symbol of Cold War-era division, not only in Germany but also around the world. It was finally demolished in 1989, following a series of political changes and social unrest within East Germany. The fall of the Berlin Wall was one of the key events leading to the eventual reunification of Germany in October 1990, marking the end of the Cold War era and the separation of East and West Germany."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But some teachers think the changes are not all for the better. Eleanor Johnson, an English professor, thinks that text messaging has made students believe that it is far more acceptable than it actually is to just make terrible spelling and grammatical errors. And she says her students over the past several years have increasingly used less formal English in their writing. Words and phrases like \\"guy\\" and \\"you know\\" now appear in research papers. Professor Johnson supposes there is a strong relationship between the rise of informal online communication and an increase in writing mistakes. But she says there may not be much scientific information, at least not yet. David Crystal, a British linguist , says the actively changing nature of the Internet makes it difficult to keep up-to-date in studying its effects. But he believes its influence on language is small. The main effect of the Internet on language is the way it has added to the expressive richness of language, providing language with a new set of communicative tools that haven't existed in the past. Erin Jansen is founder of NetLingo.com, an online dictionary of the Internet and text messaging terms. She says the new technology has not changed existing language but has greatly added to its vocabulary. Basically it's freedom of expression. And what about those teachers who find these new kinds of mistakes in spelling and grammar in their students' work? What is her message to them? Erin Jansen said, \\"I am always on the students' side and won't get angry or upset about that. If it's helping the kids write more or communicate more, that's great.

The intelligentsia was often characterized by their progressive views and commitment to the betterment of society. They played a crucial role in the development of the Polish state and its culture, as well as contributed to the spread of democratic ideals.

Have a friend help you stretch a tape measure from the front left corner to the back left corner of your truck bed, on the inside. The tape measure should be running in a straight line that's even with the top of the bed (make sure it isn't sagging in the middle).","completion":"Now that you have measured the length of your truck bed, it’s essential to get the complete dimensions to determine its capacity accurately. To do this, you will need to measure the width and height as well. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you measure the other dimensions of your truck bed: 1. Measuring the Width: First, you will need to measure the truck bed width from side to side. This measurement should be taken from the inside edges of the bed to ensure accuracy. To do this, follow these steps: a. Secure the starting point of your measuring tape to one of the inside edges of the truck bed. You can either hook the tape or have a friend hold the starting point. b. Stretch the tape measure horizontally across the truck bed, ensuring the tape is straight and parallel to the ground. c. Measure the distance to the other inside edge of the bed, at both the widest part near the cab and the narrowest part near the tailgate. This will account for any differences in width due to the wheel wells or bed design. d. Record these measurements as the maximum and minimum width of your truck bed. 2. Measuring the Height: The height of a truck bed, commonly referred to as the depth, is also an essential dimension to consider when calculating its overall capacity. To measure the height, follow these steps: a. Decide on a location where you want to measure the height of the truck bed. Ideally, this should be at least a couple of feet from either corner to help balance out any differences in bedliner or construction. b. Hold the measuring tape vertically at the chosen spot, with the starting point resting on the bed's floor inside. c. Stretch the tape measure upward until you reach the top edge of the truck bed. d. Record this measurement as the height of your truck bed. You may want to take a couple of additional height measurements at different locations along the bed, just to ensure accuracy and account for any variations in height due to bedliner or design. With the length, width, and height measurements of your truck bed in hand, you can now calculate its overall capacity. To do this, use the following formula: Truck Bed Capacity = Length × Width × Height Remember to use the appropriate width measurement depending on the specific area you want to calculate. For example, if you measured different widths due to wheel wells, you'll want to consider them when determining the available space for specific items. Finally, it's essential to compare your calculated capacity with the manufacturer's specifications for your specific make and model of truck to ensure that the measurements align and that you do not exceed the recommended payload limits. This information can typically be found in your owner's manual or on the manufacturer's website."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"The person who started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses had what descent?\\" Context: \\"Martin Luther, a German monk, started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses on the castle church of Wittenberg on October 31, 1517.

Which Swiss painter who lived from 1879 to 1940 was responsible for works such as 'The Red Balloon' in 1922, 'Landscape with Yellow Birds' in 1923 and 'Around the Fish' in 1926?","completion":"The Swiss painter who lived from 1879 to 1940, responsible for creating the works 'The Red Balloon' in 1922, 'Landscape with Yellow Birds' in 1923, and 'Around the Fish' in 1926 is Paul Klee. Born on December 18, 1879, in Münchenbuchsee near Bern, Switzerland, Klee was an influential figure in the world of art, particularly during the 20th century. He is well-known for his distinctive and unique style that blended elements of Expressionism, Surrealism, and Abstraction. Paul Klee's inclination towards art began during his early years, and he pursued his passion by studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich from 1898 to 1901. He developed his personal style through experimenting with various mediums, including drawing, printmaking, and painting, working with watercolor, ink, and oil. Klee's first significant breakthrough came in 1911 when he was introduced to the group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), a prominent and influential German expressionist group founded in Munich by Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc. During this time, Klee had the opportunity to work alongside other eminent artists like August Macke, Alexej von Jawlensky, and Gabriele Münter. Der Blaue Reiter's influence had a profound impact on Klee's artistic approach, enabling him to explore color theory and create deeply emotive compositions. Paul Klee's unique artistic style was marked by his inventive use of form, color, and symbolism. He was inspired by various art movements, including Cubism, Expressionism, and Surrealism, which often blended his work, creating powerful compositions that transcended the conventional boundaries of artistic genres. In 1922, Klee created 'The Red Balloon,' which features a harmonious blend of geometric shapes with vibrant colors dominating the foreground. This captivating image of a child holding a red balloon edges towards abstraction while maintaining a dreamlike quality that resonated with Klee's reputation for the spiritual in art. 'Landscape with Yellow Birds,' a painting created in 1923, further demonstrates Klee's exploration of color and form. Using delicate watercolor techniques and composition, he portrayed birds perched along the sweeping, multicolored lines representing the landscape, evoking a sense of harmony between nature and form, showcasing the artist's enchanting universe. 'Around the Fish,' which he painted in 1926, is another example of Paul Klee's unique blend of artistic styles. This piece incorporates geometric fish, natural elements, and various culinary objects all beautifully arranged in surreal, dreamlike composition rendered through a rich color palette that embodies Klee's mastery over color. After a prolific career, Paul Klee passed away on June 29, 1940. Today, his artwork continues to be celebrated worldwide for its individualistic style, enchanting compositions, and lasting impact on various art movements. Exhibitions of his work are displayed in museums and galleries globally, showcasing the enduring legacy of his artistry and creative vision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Vulgar Context: Will Carlson is a 20-something loser who lives in a rundown neighborhood in New Jersey, where he ekes out a living as a birthday party clown in order to pay the rent for his abusive mother's nursing home and the rent on his rundown house. Despite the difficulties of the job, clowning is Will's one escape from the realities of his miserable existence: Will genuinely likes kids, and takes great joy from making them happy on their birthdays. Struggling to make ends meet, but not wanting to give up his dream job, Will comes up with the idea to be a \\"bachelor party clown.\\" Will's idea is that men throwing bachelor parties can hire him as well as a stripper; Will enters the room prior to the \\"real\\" entertainment, wearing clown makeup and lingerie, tricking the bachelor into thinking that there was a mix-up and a gay clown stripper has been sent in lieu of a female one. Will invents the persona of Vulgar the Clown (after his friend Syd tells him that the entire idea is \\"vulgar\\") and solicits himself in the want-ads. Before long, he is hired to appear at a bachelor party being held at a nearby motel. When Will arrives for the party â wearing stockings, garters, clown makeup, and a trench-coat â he is attacked and brutally beaten by a middle-aged man, Ed, and his sons Gino and Frankie. The three men then proceed to gang rape Will, taking turns videotaping the attack. The trio hold Will hostage in the motel room for an indeterminate amount of time, during which they subject him to a series of violent and humiliating sexual assaults. They also break a bottle over his head and drug him. A tearful Will goes home and spends the remainder of the night and part of the next morning crying while he washes himself clean in the bathtub. Will spends a considerable amount of time after the attack in a crippling depression, which nearly costs him his home.

While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. Now, I have a new situation: Jacob is performing a chemistry experiment using two different liquids. Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces.

Personally Nike is my favorite one--it's so simple. And I liked the stories behind them, which made me forget all other things. McDonald's, Apple, Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well, and they are among my favorites. Nike In the Greek myth, Nike is the goddess of victory and the source of inspiration for soldiers. This logo represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek goddess. Nike's logo was designed by Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for 35, and was registered as a trademark in 1995. McDonald's The logo was designed in 1962 by Jim Schindler to resemble the archshaped signs on the side of the company's then walk-up hamburger stand. Later on, the two golden arches were combined together to form the M. The McDonald's name was added to the logo in 1968. Apple There are different stories behind Apple's logo. The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve, in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. One year later, the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne, and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. This logo didn't stay long. One year later it was replaced almost immediately by graphic designer Rob Janoff's \\" rainbow apple\\", a rainbow- colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. And then the rainbow- colored apple was replaced by the one- colored logo in 1998. It has not been changed so far. Mercedes Benz The Mercedes Benz logo, which was originally created by Gottlieb Daimler in 1909, consists of a simple description of a three- pointed star that represents its rule of the land, the sea and the air. The company was founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Marcedes is the name of Maybach's elder daughter, while Benz came as a result of a combination with Benz, Cie.and DMG in 1926.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Following the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and the forced migration of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants settled in the central Susquehanna Valley, including in the area that would become Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a potash manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses. The Priestley property, purchased in 1794 at a total cost of £500 (£ 56,400 in 2019) from Reuben Haines, who had secured the patent to the land for Northumberland, comprised four lots of the original village plan (numbers 29–32). Currently, the house and grounds occupy 1 acre (4,000 m²) at 472 Priestley Avenue. (The address of the house was originally \\"North Way\\", but the street was later renamed in honor of Joseph Priestley.) This street forms the northwest boundary of the property; the other boundaries are Hanover Avenue to the northeast, Wallis Street to the southwest, and the North Shore Railroad to the southeast. Beyond the railroad line is a baseball field, and beyond that lies the Susquehanna River, which was the original southeastern boundary of the property. The confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the main (or North) branch of the Susquehanna is a short distance southwest of the property, which is at an elevation of 456 feet (139 m).The property's original area was 2 acres (8,000 m²), but this was reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, between the house and river.

These buildings can range from just a few storeys to tall structures that accommodate dozens of families. The other options provided are not as appropriate for the given question: - Skyscraper: Although a skyscraper is a tall building, it typically serves various purposes and is not solely residential. It may contain commercial spaces, offices, and other mixed uses. Therefore, the specific context of a person living on the tenth storey does not directly point to a skyscraper as the most appropriate option. - Book of stories: A book of stories is a work of literature, not a place where someone could live or have a residence. Thus, it is unrelated to the context of the question. - Tall building: While this option is not entirely wrong, it is too broad and does not specifically cater to the residential aspect of the context. Apartment buildings, on the other hand, are designed specifically for residential purposes. - Mall: A mall is a commercial structure that primarily serves as a shopping center. Although some malls may include residential units, this is not their primary function, and it is much less likely for someone to have their home on the tenth storey of a mall. Therefore, considering the specific context of someone living on the tenth storey of a walk-up building, an \\"apartment building\\" is the most suitable and relevant answer.

The climate during this period was a mixture of two different seasons , a rainy season and a shorter dry season .","completion":"While these two sentences may seem similar at first glance, they do not convey the same meaning. The main difference between them lies in which season is described as shorter, which alters the overall understanding of the climate during the specified time period. In the first sentence: \\"During this time the climate was a mixture of two different seasons, a dry season and a shorter rainy season.\\" This conveys that the climate consisted of two seasons: a dry season of a standard length and a rainy season that was shorter in comparison to the dry season. The focus is on the dry season being longer and a significant portion of the time. Consequently, someone reading or hearing this sentence would likely get the impression that this area or time period had an overall dry and arid climate, with some periods of rainfall. In the second sentence: \\"The climate during this period was a mixture of two different seasons, a rainy season and a shorter dry season.\\" This sentence indicates that the climate consisted of two seasons as well, but here the rainy season is of standard length, and the dry season is shorter in comparison. The focus shifts to the rainy season being longer and taking up a significant portion of the time. As a result, readers or listeners would likely interpret this climate as predominantly wet or humid, with occasional dry periods. Considering the main difference is which season is shorter, the two sentences express different information about the prevalent climate during the mentioned time. The first sentence indicates a more arid climate with a shorter rainy season, while the second sentence suggests a moister climate with a shorter dry season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Which king appointed John Dryden as the first official Poet Laureate?","completion":"John Dryden was appointed as the first official Poet Laureate by King Charles II of England. Charles II was the monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, reigning from the year 1660 until his death in 1685. Born on May 29, 1630, Charles II was a prominent figure of the British Restoration period that commenced with the monarchy's restoration after the demise of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland. During the Restoration period, there was a revival of arts, literature, and culture. Charles II was a patron of the arts and took an active interest in the promotion of literary works. His reign witnessed the rise of many artists and writers who went on to achieve prominence in their respective fields. John Dryden, an English poet, literary critic, and playwright, was appointed the first official Poet Laureate in 1668. Born on August 9, 1631, Dryden was a major literary figure in Restoration England. Prior to his appointment as Poet Laureate, Dryden had written several successful plays, poems, and works of literary criticism. He played an influential role in refining the English language and defining the literary style of the time, which made him a deserving candidate for the role of Poet Laureate. The role of Poet Laureate in the United Kingdom is an honorary one, traditionally given to a poet who is expected to create verse for significant national occasions and events. While there were earlier poets who served in similar capacities before John Dryden, it was during King Charles II's reign that the position was officially recognized and sanctioned. The appointment of Dryden as the first official Poet Laureate by King Charles II set the stage for a long line of poets who would hold this prestigious position, contributing greatly to English literature and history in the process. It is worth noting that John Dryden's appointment as Poet Laureate was influenced by his political inclination towards the Stuart court. During his tenure as Poet Laureate, Dryden published several odes and poems on themes related to politics, religion, and the monarchy. However, after the ascension of the Protestant King William III and Queen Mary II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Dryden, a Roman Catholic convert, lost his position as Poet Laureate due to his religious and political affiliations. Despite losing his title, Dryden continued to make significant contributions to English literature until his death on May 12, 1700."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Grim disappeared upstairs himself, and returned about ten minutes later in the uniform of a Shereefian officer--that is to say, of Emir Feisul's Syrian army. Nothing could be smarter, not anything better calculated to disguise a man. Disguise, as any actor or detective can tell you, is not so much a matter of make- up as suggestion. It is little mannerisms--unstudied habits that identify. The suggestion that you are some one else is the thing to strive for, not the concealment of who you really are. Grim's skin had been sun-tanned in the Arab campaign under Lawrence against the Turks. The Shereefian helmet is a compromise between the East and West, having a strip of cloth hanging down behind it as far as the shoulders and covering the ears on either side, to take the place of the Arab head-dress. The khaki uniform had just enough of Oriental touch about it to distinguish it from that of a British officer. No man inexperienced in disguise would dream of choosing it; for the simple reason that it would not seem to him disguise enough. Yet Grim now looked so exactly like somebody else that it was hard to believe he was the same man who had been in the room ten minutes before.

QB Chad Pennington got off to a quick start, completing a 57-yard pass to Laveranues Coles. Both New York and Cincinnati were able to move the ball back and forth in the first half, ending the half with the Jets on top 20-10. The fourth quarter would eventually prove to be the Jets undoing, however. After giving up a touchdown in the third quarter to make the score 23-17, the Jets gave up three touchdowns and only scored their last touchdown in the closing seconds of the game, ending with a 38-31 loss. The fourth quarter was marked by many mistakes, including a costly pass interference by Darrelle Revis and a fumble and interception by Chad Pennington. The pass interference kept a Bengals drive alive, and the fumble gave the Bengals the ball at midfield. Finally, with 50&#160;seconds left in the game, Pennington throws a hurried pass into the hands of Bengal Johnathan Joseph, who runs the ball 42&#160;yards for the game-sealing touchdown.

What is the answer for the question: Who later expanded their original idea to include a third opera with mystic or religious tones? from the following article ? The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

Problem:Abstract: To define the genetic changes of flat urothelial lesions, carcinoma in situ (CIS) and moderate dysplasias (DII) were investigated for alterations in the two chromosomal regions most frequently involved in bladder cancer. Overall, 33 CIS and 16 DII from 21 patients were used to microdissect urothelium. Dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using gene locus probes of 9q22 (FACC), 9p21 (CDK), 17p13 (p53), and related centromeric probes was applied on interphase nuclei. In parallel, preamplified DNA of these samples was used for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses with eight microsatellite markers on chromosomes 9p, 9q and 17p, and for sequencing of exons 5-9 of p53. Data indicated nearly identical deletion frequencies for chromosomes 9 and 17 for CIS (chromosome 9, 86%; p53, 84%). DII showed a lower deletion rate in comparison with CIS (chromosome 9, 75%; p53, 53%). A very high correlation between the results of FISH and LOH analyses was found. p53 mutations were detected in 12 of 15 patients (CIS, 72%; DII, 67%). In three of 16 patients with multifocal tumors, oligoclonal lesions were identified by LOH analyses, a finding further supported by sequencing of p53, by which two different p53 deletions were detected in two cases. In conclusion, data from microdissected flat urothelial lesions indicate that chromosome 9 deletions cannot be regarded as indicators of papillary growth, because they are found frequently in both types of flat lesions of the urothelium: those associated with papillary tumors and those that are not. The similar distribution and lower amount of genetic changes in DII render DII a possible precursor lesion of CIS..

Options: - arguments - dust poisoning - headache - exhaustion - boredom Explain why a human would choose \\"headache\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"headache\\" as the answer to the question above because dust, when inhaled during housework, can lead to various physical discomforts, including headaches. When there is a lot of dust in the environment, particularly during cleaning activities, it can irritate the respiratory system and the eyes, causing discomfort and potentially a headache. Dust particles are typically small and can easily spread in the air, particularly during cleaning tasks such as sweeping, vacuuming, or dusting. When a person breathes in these particles, they can irritate the sensitive mucous membranes in the nose and throat, causing inflammation and discomfort. Prolonged exposure to dust can also worsen pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma or allergies, which can further contribute to headache development. Additionally, dust may contain various allergens, such as pollen, mold spores, or pet dander. In people who are sensitive to these allergens, exposure to dust can trigger an allergic reaction. The body responds to these allergens by releasing histamines, which can lead to inflammation and a variety of symptoms, including sinus congestion, sneezing, coughing, watery eyes, and, of course, headaches. Headaches caused by dust exposure may also be linked to eye strain and irritation, as dust particles coming in contact with the eyes can create discomfort and hinder vision. This eye irritation and strain can trigger headaches in some individuals. While the other options, such as arguments, dust poisoning, exhaustion, and boredom, can potentially result from housework or be associated with exposure to dust in varying contexts, they are less likely to be selected by a human as the primary outcome caused by dust exposure. The description of \\"a lot of dust\\" in the question heavily implies that the issue at hand is a physical health concern, which aligns more closely with the development of a headache rather than the other options presented. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"headache\\" as the answer to the question because exposure to high levels of dust during housework can lead to various physical and respiratory discomforts, of which headache is a common and well-recognized symptom. This selection is further supported by the overall context of the question, which emphasizes the impact of dust on health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Chinese New Year is now known as the Spring Festival because it starts from the beginning of spring. Though there are some sayings about its origin, all agree that the word Nian, which in modern Chinese means \\"year\\", was originally the name of a beast that started to eat people the night before the beginning of a new year. One story goes that the beast Nian had a very big mouth that would take in a great many people at one time. People were very afraid. One day, an old man came to their help and said he would stop all this. He said to Nian, \\"I hear that you are very strong, but can you eat up all the beasts on earth instead of people who are too weak to be your enemies?\\" \\"Yes,\\" Nian agreed with him and went to kill many of the beasts on earth. People were very happy because those beasts also did bad things to people and killed their farm animals from time to time. After that, the old man, who was a god, rode on the beast Nian and left. Nian was gone, and other beasts also went into forests; people began to enjoy their happy life. Before the old man left, he had told people to put up red paper-cuts on their windows and doors at each year's end to drive Nian away, because red is the color the beast felt most afraid of. From then on, every year at the beginning of spring, people prepare to \\"Guo Nian\\". The word \\"Guo Nian\\" means \\"go through the Nian safely\\". Putting up red paper-cuts to drive Nian away and making dumplings for a better new year are still an every-year doing by the Chinese people. However, people today have long forgotten why they are doing all this, they just feel the color and the food make the New Year very enjoyable.

THERE was no obstacle to the speedy departure of Romayne and his wife from Vange Abbey. The villa at Highgate--called Ten Acres Lodge, in allusion to the measurement of the grounds surrounding the house--had been kept in perfect order by the servants of the late Lady Berrick, now in the employment of her nephew. On the morning after their arrival at the villa, Stella sent a note to her mother. The same afternoon, Mrs. Eyrecourt arrived at Ten Acres--on her way to a garden-party. Finding the house, to her great relief, a modern building, supplied with all the newest comforts and luxuries, she at once began to plan a grand party, in celebration of the return of the bride and bridegroom. \\"I don't wish to praise myself,\\" Mrs. Eyrecourt said; \\"but if ever there was a forgiving woman, I am that person.

Tea and coffee, my dear Romayne, in your study; Coote's quadrille band; the supper from Gunter's, the grounds illuminated with colored lamps; Tyrolese singers among the trees, relieved by military music--and, if there _are_ any African or other savages now in London, there is room enough in these charming grounds for encampments, dances, squaws, scalps, and all the rest of it, to end in a blaze of fireworks.\\" A sudden fit of coughing seized her, and stopped the further enumeration of attractions at the contemplated ball.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who used photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent? , can you please find it? In 1960, Ronald William Clark published a biography titled Sir Mortimer Wheeler. FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing \\"this very readable little book\\" as being \\"adulatory\\" in tone, \\"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu–Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the South Asian Studies journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent. In 2011, the academic journal Public Archaeology published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting archaeology to the British public. Two years later, the Papers from the Institute of Archaeology issued a short comic strip by Moshenska and Alex Salamunovich depicting Wheeler's activities in studying the archaeology of Libya during World War II.","completion":"The first name of the person who used photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent is Mortimer.

Over the last 13 months there has been a series of extremely bloody attacks on schools, colleges and universities. On Wednesday Taliban suicide bombers mounted an assault in north-western Pakistan; just over a year ago the same movement attacked a school only 30 miles away,killing 150 people, most of them children. In April last year 147 were killed in a massacre at a university in northern Kenya by the Somalia-based al-Shabaab. Then there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of other incidents of violence directed at educational institutions, teachers or students across the world which have not been reported. Related: Pakistan attacks: at least 30 dead in terror raid at Bacha Khan University Why would terrorists attack such targets? One obvious answer is because they can. Schools are usually unprotected. Embassies, military bases, even hotels are, after a decade and a half of rolling waves of terrorist violence across the world, now harder to hit. But there are other reasons, too. Terrorism aims to undermine the legitimacy and authority of a state. In many parts of the world, the local school is that state’s only tangible presence. Another goal is simply to stall education, of both girls and boys, though the former tends to prompt a greater reaction. In 2012 the Pakistani Taliban tried to kill a 15-year-old schoolgirl, Malala Yousufzai, who went on to become an international icon. A more pragmatic aim may be to send a message to policymakers or even to the general public. What is clear is that such attacks are increasing. Data compiled by the University of Maryland in the US shows a dramatic increase in violence directed at schools following the 2004 massacre at a school in Beslan in southern Russia of more than 300 people, including 186 children. This is easily explained. It is in line with the rise of terrorism more generally over the period. The proportion of attacks on educational institutions overall – between 3% and 5% – has barely changed. But, again reflecting a more general trend, the attacks are now much more lethal. According to another recent study by the University of Maryland, “mass-fatality terrorist events” – defined as those in which more than 100 people are killed by terrorists in one country in one day – occurred just over four times a year on average between 1978 and 2013. In 2014, there were 26. In 2015, the number is equivalent or higher, depending on how many of the massacres carried out by Islamic State and Boko Haram, the extremist movement based in north-eastern Nigeria, are counted. Boko Haram has made targeting schools and students a priority, most infamously abducting 276 schoolgirls in 2014. Nigerian officials say they still have no idea where they are. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is talking about how terrorists are attacking schools and universities more often. The important parts are: 1. There have been many bloody attacks on schools, colleges, and universities in the last 13 months. 2. Terrorists are targeting schools because they are usually unprotected and easier to attack than places like embassies or military bases. 3.

The Appalachians are also home to two species of fir, the boreal balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and the southern high elevation endemic, Fraser fir (Abies fraseri). Fraser fir is confined to the highest parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains, where along with red spruce it forms a fragile ecosystem known as the Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest. Fraser fir rarely occurs below 5,500 ft (1,700 m), and becomes the dominant tree type at 6,200 ft (1,900 m). By contrast, balsam fir is found from near sea level to the tree line in the northern Appalachians, but ranges only as far south as Virginia and West Virginia in the central Appalachians, where it is usually confined above 3,900 ft (1,200 m) asl, except in cold valleys. Curiously, it is associated with oaks in Virginia. The balsam fir of Virginia and West Virginia is thought by some to be a natural hybrid between the more northern variety and Fraser fir. While red spruce is common in both upland and bog habitats, balsam fir, as well as black spruce and tamarack, are more characteristic of the latter.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Kendall?\\", is \\"Wasteful\\" a valid answer? Choose your answer from: 1). Yes. 2). No. Answer:","completion":"1). Yes. Describing Kendall as \\"wasteful\\" is a valid answer. Here is a detailed explanation as to why: Kendall's action of throwing the lunch their mother made for them to the dogs, rather than consuming it or trying to diplomatically address the issue, can be seen as an act of waste, particularly when considering the time, effort, and resources that went into the preparation of the meal. Kendall didn't seem to take these factors into account when they chose to dispose of the lunch in this manner. By discarding the lunch, Kendall wasted the ingredients used to make it, as well as the energy and time their mother devoted to preparing the meal. Moreover, their action could lead to spoilage, as the dogs might not consume the entire lunch. Furthermore, the discarded meal could have had another purpose, such as being offered to another family member or consumed at a later time. In addition to being wasteful, Kendall's behavior might also be seen as disrespectful toward their mother, as they disregarded her efforts in providing sustenance. Instead of discussing their preferences or other solutions with their mother, Kendall chose a more impulsive and thoughtless approach. In conclusion, describing Kendall as \\"wasteful\\" is a valid answer due to the various factors mentioned above. However, it is essential to note that this description might not encompass the entirety of Kendall's character, and it should not be used as a generalization. There might be other aspects of Kendall's personality, and it is possible that they could have been acting out of character in this particular situation.

We already defined a homogeneous mixture in step 2 above: A homogeneous mixture is a mixture in which the components are uniformly and evenly distributed, and it appears to be the same throughout. 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Step 1: Analyze the questions Question 1 is asking if a solution is considered a homogeneous mixture. Question 2 is asking for the definition of a homogeneous mixture. Step 2: Determine if they are paraphrases Paraphrases are reworded versions of the same question or statement, with the same meaning. Step 3: Answer the question These two questions are not paraphrases of each other. While they are related, they have different meanings and elicit different answers - one confirms the relationship between solutions and homogeneous mixtures while the other asks for a definition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although the wording is slightly different, the meaning is the same between the two statements. The premise, \\"yeah I grew up over in New Mexico at Roswell,\\" implies that the person spent their formative years in Roswell, New Mexico.

Similarly, the hypothesis, \\"I was raised in Roswell, New Mexico,\\" conveys the same idea. The phrase \\"being raised\\" mirrors the idea of \\"growing up\\" in a specific place, as it suggests that the person spent their early life in Roswell and was shaped by the experiences they encountered within that location.

She learns that her talent is to be one of the tinkers, the fairies who make and fix things. Two other tinker fairies, Bobble (Rob Paulsen) and Clank (Jeff Bennett), teach her their craft, and tell her about the fairies who visit the mainland to bring each season. Tinker Bell is thrilled and cannot wait to go to the mainland for spring. While out working, she meets Silvermist (Lucy Liu), a water fairy; Rosetta (Kristin Chenoweth), a garden fairy; Iridessa (Raven-SymonÃ©), a light fairy; and Fawn (America Ferrera), an animal fairy. After meeting them, she notices Vidia (Pamela Adlon), a fast-flying fairy who immediately dislikes her because of her unusually strong talent. Vidia challenges her to prove she will be able to go to the mainland, and Tinker Bell creates several inventions, which she shows to the Minister of Spring (Steve Valentine). But Tinker Bell soon learns from Queen Clarion (Anjelica Huston) that only nature-talent fairies visit the mainland. She tries her hand at nature skills; making dewdrops with Silvermist, lighting fireflies with Iridessa, and trying with Fawn to teach baby birds to fly, but she fails miserably at all of these. Meanwhile, Bobble and Clank cover for Tinker Bell when questioned by Fairy Mary (Jane Horrocks), the tinker fairy overseer.

Which language is this?","completion":"The language used in this sentence, \\"Bu şekilde ABD hükümetinin sağladığı başlangıç sermayesini de ikiye katladı,\\" is Turkish. Turkish is a major language spoken in Turkey and the surrounding regions. It belongs to the Turkic language family, and it's written in a Latin script that was established as the official alphabet in 1928 under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Turkey itself is located between southeastern Europe and western Asia and holds a unique position as a nation straddling these two continents. The influence of both European and Asian cultures is thus easily observed in its language, traditions, and sociocultural norms. Linguistic characteristics of Turkish include vowel harmony (where the vowels within a word need to harmonise with each other in terms of their placement and characteristics) and agglutination (where a lot of grammatical information is packed into suffixes that are attached to the root of a word). There are no genders in Turkish which simplifies the language for learners somewhat, and word order also differs from most other major languages - typically in Turkish the subject of a sentence comes first, followed by the object and then the verb. The given sentence translates to \\"In this way, it doubled the seed capital provided by the US government.\\" This statement can apply in a wide range of contexts, such as investment, financial aid, or business ventures, among others. The specific context would provide further meaning to this statement. Overall, Turkish, being the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, has a rich history and plays a significant role in world affairs due to Turkey's geopolitical position. Especially the country's roles in NATO, G20, and other international alliances contribute to the global presence of the Turkish language. Therefore, learning and understanding Turkish becomes useful in many fields, from diplomacy to business and trade."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The SATs, or the Scholastic Assessment Test, is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. It is designed to assess a student's readiness for college and serves as a key factor in college application evaluations. By investing time and effort in preparing for the SATs, Tracy aimed to perform well on this crucial test. A high SAT score is often recognized as an important factor by colleges and universities when deciding which students to admit. A good score can significantly improve Tracy's chances of getting accepted into a reputable institution, which is essential for her future academic and professional success. In addition to increasing her chances of acceptance in a competitive college, having a strong SAT score can also qualify Tracy for academic scholarships and other forms of financial aid.

In summary, Tracy dedicated a week to studying for the SATs because she wanted to secure her chances of getting into a good college.

Elk Modern subspecies are descended from elk that once inhabited Beringia, a steppe region between Asia and North America that connected the two continents during the Pleistocene. Beringia provided a migratory route for numerous mammal species, including brown bear, camel, horse, caribou, and moose, as well as humans. As the Pleistocene came to an end, ocean levels began to rise; elk migrated southwards into Asia and North America. In North America they adapted to almost all ecosystems except for tundra, true deserts, and the gulf coast of the U.S. The elk of southern Siberia and central Asia were once more widespread but today are restricted to the mountain ranges west of Lake Baikal including the Sayan and Altai Mountains of Mongolia and the Tianshan region that borders Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and China's Xinjiang Province. The habitat of Siberian elk in Asia is similar to that of the Rocky Mountain subspecies in North America.

They are both big animals that are part of the deer family, but they have differences.

Elks are usually found in forests and can have really big antlers that look like a tree branch. Caribous, which are also called reindeer in some places (yes, just like the ones that pull Santa's sleigh), usually live in really cold places, like the North Pole, and both boy and girl caribous can have antlers, not just boys like in most deer families.

Definition: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Input: By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The critcism comes from Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who said some firms had paid no tax and hidden their earnings offshore. And he promised to back the regulator Ofwat in tightening up rules to protect bill-payers and the environment. The industry body Water UK responded that the companies were dealing firmly with issues that threatened trust. But Mr Gove’s speech to a water industry conference must have made uncomfortable listening. He complained that water firms had paid out almost all of their £18bn profits to shareholders, instead of re-investing it in mending leaks and protecting the environment. And he named names: The boss of United Utilities taking home £2.8m a year; the head of Severn Trent, £2.4m. The secretary of state said last year Anglian and Southern paid zero corporation tax, whilst Thames has paid no corporation tax for a decade. He suggested: \\"Some of their best brains appear to be as intent on financial engineering as much as real engineering.\\" Mr Gove promised to back recommendations from the regulator Ofwat due to be published in April – and said he would not hesitate to increase the pressure. He told the firms: \\"You may be private companies, but you have a responsibility to the public who can’t take their custom elsewhere.\\" The politician complained that three billion litres of water still leak out every day - and said the figure has barely improved in the past four years. He said there had been no investment in new nationally significant supply infrastructure, such as major reservoirs, since privatisation. Craig Bennett from Friends of the Earth welcomed the comments but said Mr Gove could do much more himself to improve management of water. \\"Defra are not doing enough,\\" he told BBC News. \\"They are still allowing new houses on flood plains – and there is constant backsliding on the need to use water more efficiently.\\" Dr Matt Prescott from the Environmental Rating Agency told BBC News: “The environmental problems with the industry are a signal of financial problems \\"We need effective regulation – it’s clearly not happening at the moment. Politicians can’t just have an obsession with bills.\\" Dr Prescott said that during the recent prosecution of Thames Water at Aylesbury Crown Court they found that the Environment Agency did not have direct access to independently sourced pollution monitoring data. Instead, they had to rely on to water companies to self-monitor pollution levels discharged from sewage works. \\"We think these forms of self-regulation should stop,\\" he said. Water UK Chief Executive Michael Roberts countered that companies were putting public interest first. \\"Water is fundamental to all of our lives, and companies fully understand their clear responsibility to act in the public interest,\\" he said. \\"For me, that boils down to doing the right thing in the right way, and tackling issues where they arise, because we want to maintain the high levels of trust our customers have for us. \\"We know that they trust us, because more than eight out of 10 of them say so in our private polling. \\"We should not lose sight of that as we address some of the issues that critics have raised.

Elvin chimes in, announcing his availability to help Trisha by saying, \\"I'm ok,\\" which can be understood as him agreeing to pick her up. 4. Vinnie acknowledges Elvin's response and indicates his agreement with the plan, showing no objections and accepting the situation by replying with a simple \\"ok then.\\" 5. Elvin proceeds to confirm the pickup time and asks if it should be at 8:15 a.m. This is an attempt to finalize the arrangement by specifying a time of departure. 6. Trisha appreciates the assistance and enthusiastically expresses her gratitude by saying, \\"thx a million!\\" Here, \\"thx\\" is short for \\"thanks\\" and is another example of abbreviated words in informal communication. The phrase \\"a million\\" is used to heighten the intensity of her gratitude, emphasizing how relieved and thankful she is to have transportation to the university.

Question: \\"Why did change his name to Napoleon Bonaparte?\\" Context: \\"Napoleon was born on 15 August 1769, to Carlo Maria di Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino, in his family's ancestral home Casa Buonaparte in Ajaccio, the capital of the island of Corsica. He was their fourth child and third son. This was a year after the island was transferred to France by the Republic of Genoa. He was christened Napoleone di Buonaparte, probably named after an uncle (an older brother who did not survive infancy was the first of the sons to be called Napoleone). In his 20s, he adopted the more French-sounding Napoléon Bonaparte.[note 2]\\" Answer:","completion":"Napoleon Bonaparte, initially born as Napoleone di Buonaparte, changed his name in his 20s to adopt a more French-sounding name. There are several reasons that led to this decision. 1. Assimilation into French society: When Corsica became a part of France, the residents of the island, including the Buonaparte family, were incorporated into the French society. By changing his name to a more French-sounding version, Napoleon aimed to better assimilate into the French culture, as it would facilitate his acceptance and opportunities within the society. This change would make it easier for him to pursue education, establish connections, and seek career advancements in the French mainland. 2. Rise in Military and Political Career: Napoleon went to mainland France to pursue his education and military training, where he joined the French Army and later rose through the ranks to become a prominent political and military figure. By adopting the name Napoléon Bonaparte, he was sending a clear message that he had integrated to French society and was dedicated to the French cause. The French-sounding name would enable him to gain respect and trust, both from the military and the civilian population. 3. Elimination of possible discrimination: As a Corsican with an Italian-sounding name in the French military and political landscape, Napoleon could have faced discrimination and other obstacles due to his origins. By adopting a French-sounding name, he minimized the risk of being ostracized or facing resistance due to his identity. This strategic decision allowed him to focus on his military and political aspirations without worrying about potential backlash or bias stemming from his name. 4. Reputation and branding: By the time Napoleon changed his name, he had started to build a reputation as a skilled military officer. He understood the importance of building a strong personal brand and saw the benefits of better aligning his name with the French culture. Transforming his name from Napoleone di Buonaparte to Napoléon Bonaparte showcased this intent and helped him solidify his image as a rising star in France's military and political landscape. In conclusion, Napoleon's decision to change his name by adopting a more French-sounding version was a calculated move aimed at better assimilating into the French society, advancing in his career, avoiding potential discrimination, and strengthening his personal brand. This change in his name played a significant role in helping him achieve the incredible feats that defined his life and career, eventually leading him to become one of history's most famous leaders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: Though she did not again win the Sulman, she was successful in having works hung in that competition on many occasions, including the 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1950 shows. Bellette continued to paint classical scenes, and around 1950 produced the work Chorus without Iphigenia. Purchased by the National Gallery of Australia in 1976, this oil painting shows five figures, \\"posed like statues in a tableau vivant, [and who] possess a kind of erotic energy\\". Anne Gray, the National Gallery's curator, interpreted the scene chosen by Bellette: Although nothing is happening in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death. In 1951, Bellette came second in the Commonwealth Jubilee Art Competition, behind the young Jeffrey Smart. The following year, she won a competitive exhibition sponsored by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, with Girl With Still Life.Although Haefliger never critiqued his wife's exhibitions, others occasionally stepped in to provide reviews in the Herald.

Please answer a question about the following article about Geological history of Earth: Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10% of the Earth's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow. Some of this object's mass merged with the Earth, significantly altering its internal composition, and a portion was ejected into space. Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, augmented by ice delivered from comets, produced the oceans.

During this period, Earth was subject to extremely high temperatures, which caused the formation of molten rock and metals. The planet's outer layer was in a constant state of flux, and it lacked a solid crust. The formation of a solid crust began much later when the outer layer started to cool down, allowing water to accumulate in the atmosphere. Concurrently, a series of geological and astronomical events — including the formation of the Moon due to a significant impact and the gradual development of Earth's primordial atmosphere — guided the Earth's evolution towards its current state.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court? is inside the article: (English: \\"The Marriage of Thetis\\") After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide \\"if you tell me to do so\\". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi.

Step 2: Secure the cat Carefully wrap the cat in a towel or blanket to help restrict its movement and avoid any accidental scratches or bites. It's vital to keep the cat as still as possible to prevent further injury or stress. Step 3: Open and check the cat's mouth Gently open the cat's mouth and inspect it for any visible obstructions. If you can see the object, use a pair of tweezers or your fingers to carefully remove it. Be cautious not to accidentally push the object deeper into the cat's throat. Step 4: Perform the Heimlich maneuver for cats (if necessary) If the obstruction cannot be removed manually, perform the Heimlich maneuver for cats. To do this, place the cat on its side, with its back against your chest. Place one hand under the cat's chest, just below the ribcage, and use your other hand to apply pressure in an upward and inward motion. Repeat this process several times to help dislodge the object. Step 5: Assess the situation After attempting the previous steps, reassess the cat's condition. If the choking signs have stopped and the cat appears to be breathing normally, the object may have been dislodged. If not, continue attempting to clear the obstruction, but also consider seeking immediate professional assistance. Step 6: Seek veterinary help Even if the cat has successfully stopped choking, it's essential to have them checked by a veterinarian. There may be underlying issues that have caused the choking incident, or the cat may have suffered injuries during the situation. In summary, after identifying a choking cat and being aware of the signs that mimic choking, the most logical next event is to secure the cat and attempt to remove any visible obstructions in its mouth or perform the Heimlich maneuver for cats. After the situation is resolved, seek veterinary help to ensure the cat's health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which very famous door cannot be opened from the outside?","completion":"The very famous door that cannot be opened from the outside is the door of the British Prime Minister's official residence, 10 Downing Street. The residence, located in Westminster, London, is one of the most recognized and iconic buildings in the United Kingdom. It serves as the headquarters and primary residence of the serving prime minister, and has been home to numerous British leaders since Sir Robert Walpole became the first prime minister to reside there in 1735. The black front door of 10 Downing Street is an essential symbol of the British government and has various security, historical, and symbolic qualities that distinguish it from other doorways. Here are some of the key features and functionality of the door: 1. No exterior handle: One of the primary security features of the door is that it lacks any handle or knob on the outside. This design decision was deliberately made to keep the building secure and prevent unauthorized access. Consequently, the door cannot be opened from the outside, preventing potential intruders or uninvited guests from entering the property. 2. Reinforced for security: The door is approximately 5.5 ft. (1.67 m) tall and 3 ft. (0.91 m) wide, and it is made from a heavy and secure blast-resistant material to protect the occupants from potential attacks. It is also said to be bulletproof and airtight, providing additional safety precautions for its residents. 3. Painted in glossy black: The front door is traditionally painted in dark glossy black. The striking color contributes to the iconic appearance of 10 Downing Street, as does the brass hardware and emblematic white fanlight window located above the door. 4. Number 10 on the door: A large white number 10 adorns the center of the door, signifying the building's address. The number is distinctively slanted to the right, with the zero sitting slightly higher than the one, adding to its distinctive appearance. 5. Traditional lion door knocker: The door also features a large brass door knocker in the shape of a lion's head. The door knocker is a historic design element and is instantly recognizable as the symbol of Downing Street's famous front door. 6. Letterbox and doorknob: The door has a brass letterbox that is inscribed with the words \\"First Lord of the Treasury,\\" which is an official title for the British Prime Minister. A brass doorknob is also present on the right side of the door, but it is only functional from the inside. Due to the security risks associated with the prominent position of the Prime Minister and various terrorist threats in the past, No. 10 Downing Street has undergone several security upgrades and changes throughout the years. However, the decision to maintain a front door without an exterior handle or knob continues to be an essential and defining feature of this historic and famous location."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No, the given sentence does not answer the question \\"How did Gaddafi die?\\" Instead, it provides information about Gaddafi's actions that led to Libya being labeled an \\"international pariah.\\" It mentions the unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, Gaddafi's support for foreign militants, and his alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing. To answer the question about Gaddafi's death, we must explore the events that occurred towards the end of his rule. Muammar Gaddafi, the former Libyan leader, was killed on October 20, 2011, near his hometown of Sirte in Libya. His death was a result of the Libyan Civil War, which was a conflict between Gaddafi's government and various rebel forces that sought to oust him from power. The civil war began in February 2011, following the Arab Spring movement that swept across North Africa and the Middle East. The movement led to widespread protests and uprisings against the regimes in countries like Tunisia and Egypt. In Libya, the protests rapidly evolved into an armed conflict between Gaddafi loyalists and anti-Gaddafi rebels. The conflict escalated, and the United Nations imposed a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians. The situation attracted international intervention. NATO and its partners launched a military campaign called Operation Unified Protector, with the aim of enforcing the no-fly zone and protecting civilians from Gaddafi's forces. This operation significantly weakened Gaddafi's government and military capabilities. By August 2011, rebel forces had entered the capital city of Tripoli, and Gaddafi's regime began to collapse. He fled the capital and went into hiding. On October 20, 2011, Gaddafi was discovered by opposition forces hiding in a drainage pipe near Sirte, his hometown. He was captured by rebels from the Misrata-based brigade and then violently killed by his captors. Graphic images and videos of the capture and killing were widely circulated around the world, marking the brutal end of Gaddafi's 42-year rule. In summary, the sentence provided does not answer the question about Gaddafi's death. Instead, it gives information about events that led to Libya being branded an \\"international pariah\\" under Gaddafi's rule."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Second question: Can you go from one country to the neighbouring country by car? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First, let me analyze and answer both questions separately. Question 1: What countries does the Equator go through? Step 1: To find which countries the Equator passes through, I will refer to a world map or consult relevant information sources. Step 2: After researching, I find that the Equator passes through 13 countries: Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Sao Tome & Principe, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Kenya, Somalia, Indonesia, Kiribati, and Maldives. Answer to Question 1: The Equator goes through Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Sao Tome & Principe, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Kenya, Somalia, Indonesia, Kiribati, and Maldives. Question 2: Can you go from one country to the neighbouring country by car? Step 1: Determine which countries in the world the user is referring to, as the question doesn't specify any particular pair of countries. Step 2: Due to the open-ended nature of the question, I will provide a general answer regarding the possibility of traveling between neighboring countries by car. Answer to Question 2: In many cases, you can go from one country to a neighboring country by car, provided that there are roads, bridges, or tunnels connecting them. International borders may require passing through customs and immigration checkpoints. However, it's important to note that some borders might restrict vehicle passage, have rough terrain, or be separated by water bodies with no available road connections. Now, I will answer the question about whether these two questions are asking the same thing. Analysis: The first question is asking about the specific countries through which the Equator passes. The second question is asking about the possibility of traveling between neighboring countries by car. Answer: No, these two questions are not asking the same thing.

Help as much as you can. Background: Prokaryotes have a different way to increase genetic variation. It’s called genetic transfer or bacterial conjugation . It can occur in two ways. One way is when cells “grab” stray pieces of DNA from their environment. The other way is when cells directly exchange DNA (usually plasmids) with other cells. For example, as shown in Figure below , the donor cell makes a structure called an F pilus , or sex pilus. The F pilus attaches one cell to another cell. The membranes of the two cells merge and genetic material, usually a plasmid , moves into the recipient cell. Genetic transfer makes bacteria very useful in biotechnology. It can be used to create bacterial cells that carry new genes. Paragraph: Two researches studied living organisms, Joe studied eukaryotes, while Bill studied prokaryotes.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Which is not a source of warmth for incubation: the sun, volcanic sources, or megapodes?\\" is in \\"Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The passage you provided states that the warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation, or volcanic sources. Based on this information, all three options— the sun, volcanic sources, and megapodes— are indeed sources of warmth for incubation. However, your question asks for the option that is not a source of warmth for incubation. It appears that there may be some confusion in the question itself, as the provided passage indicates that all three options you mention are indeed sources of warmth for incubation. Megapodes are a type of bird that use external heat sources like the sun and volcanic sources to keep their eggs warm; thereby, aiding in incubation. Therefore, the correct response should be that all three mentioned sources are relevant to incubation. It is essential to recognize that the question formulation might be ambiguous, as it inadvertently presents the megapodes as a potential heat source for incubation rather than a species of birds that utilize the heat sources mentioned (sun and volcanic sources) for incubation purposes."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole).

Answer:","completion":"The player for the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1947-48 season who earned the nickname \\"Mr. Basketball\\" was George Mikan. Born on June 18, 1924, in Joliet, Illinois, George Mikan was an American professional basketball player who became one of the most dominant forces in the first decade of the NBA. Mikan was a 6-foot-10-inch tall center with a remarkable set of skills that allowed him to excel not only defensively but offensively as well. His dominance inside the paint and on the boards, combined with an effective hook shot, helped him become a prolific scorer and rebounder in the early years of the league. After a successful college basketball career with the DePaul University Blue Demons, where he was coached by Hall of Famer Ray Meyer, Mikan was drafted by the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1946. After the Gears folded, he was picked up by the Minneapolis Lakers in 1947, beginning his career in the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which later merged with the NBL to form the NBA. Mikan was a four-time All-Star and a six-time All-NBA First Team Selection. During his time with the Lakers, the team won five championships in six years (1949, 1950, 1952, 1953, and 1954). Mikan's on-court presence was so transcendent that he was able to significantly impact the way basketball was played and officiated. As a dominant big man with excellent defensive instincts, Mikan played a key role in the NBA's eventual decision to widen the lane from six feet to twelve feet in an attempt to neutralize his proficiency inside the paint. Additionally, Mikan's propensity for goaltending shots led the league to establish goaltending rules. Consequently, his achievements earned him the nickname \\"Mr. Basketball,\\" a testament to his contribution to the growth and development of the sport. George Mikan retired in 1956, ending a decorated career in which he was consistently one of the top players in the league. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, solidifying his status as one of basketball's all-time greats. Moreover, Mikan's \\"Mr. Basketball\\" moniker has lived on and has been synonymous with legendary players who have had a profound effect on the sport. In conclusion, George Mikan, who played for the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1947-48 season, was nicknamed \\"Mr. Basketball\\" due to his dominating presence on the court, his innovative style of play, and his significant contributions to the evolution of the sport. As a trailblazer in the early years of professional basketball, Mikan's impact can still be seen in today's NBA; his legacy is an integral part of basketball history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Usage: In this problem, the concept of ratio is involved in dividing the profit earned between P and Q. The problem requires us to find the amount invested by Q based on the given ratio and investment made by P. So, the concept of ratio is the key part in this definition. Why? Because the problem directly gives us the ratio (2:3) in which the profit earned was divided between P and Q. Part #2: Set up an equation based on the given information. Usage: Based on the information given, we can set up a linear equation that represents the investments made by P and Q. Let the investment made by Q be x.

A:","completion":"I understand your perspective about the oak tree falling and making sunlight available to surrounding plants. However, the initial question seems to be asking for a general answer about what natural phenomenon typically allows sunlight to reach nearby plants. In this case, it is not specifically about grass or oak trees. The more relevant answer would focus on the process of plant growth and competition for resources, such as sunlight. In a plant community or ecosystem, larger plants and trees may block sunlight from reaching the smaller plants around them. When these larger plants die or fall, they create a gap in the canopy, allowing sunlight to become available to the surrounding smaller plants. This occurrence is known as gap dynamics. Gap dynamics is an essential process in maintaining the balance of an ecosystem. As older, taller, or more established plants die or are removed, it allows younger plants and different species to grow. This process promotes biodiversity and regeneration in the plant community. So, the right answer to the question \\"what falls making sunlight available to surrounding plants?\\" would be something like \\"larger plants, trees, or other barriers to sunlight that are removed from the plant community through natural processes, such as death, disturbance, or falling. This creates gaps, enabling sunlight to reach nearby smaller plants and promoting growth and diversity within the ecosystem.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Yes, we can conclude that \\"The Echizen recipes of crab and soba are still prepared today.\\" Providing a long and detailed answer: The mention of culinary delights including Echizen crab and distinctive Echizen soba strongly implies that these dishes are not just well-known, but they are also appreciated and enjoyed in contemporary times. The fact that they are described as \\"delights\\" suggests that they hold a special place in the local or regional cuisine, and there is demand and interest in continuing to prepare them today. The term \\"culinary delights\\" itself often refers to dishes that have a rich history or tradition and are still valued in modern cuisine. In the case of Echizen crab and Echizen soba, these recipes likely have their roots in the Echizen region of Japan, which is known for its seafood and buckwheat noodle dishes. The fact that these dishes are still considered \\"delights\\" today signifies that the traditional recipes continue to be enjoyed and appreciated in contemporary times. Echizen crab, also known as Echizen-gani and botan-gani, is a prized Japanese winter delicacy. Native to the Sea of Japan, this species of crab is rich in flavor, making it highly sought after in the culinary world. The harvesting season of Echizen crab is typically from November to March and is a significant component of the local fishing culture. Today, Echizen crab is still used in various dishes such as Sashimi, grilled, boiled, hot pot, and more, retaining their position as a culinary delight in the community. Echizen soba, on the other hand, is a well-known Japanese buckwheat noodle dish and a regional specialty of Fukui Prefecture, which includes the former Echizen Province. The distinctive Echizen soba is characterized by its slightly thicker and rough texture which gives it a unique mouthfeel. This soba's preparation methods differ from those of others, and it is often served with tasty dipping sauces or garnishes. The long-standing tradition of making soba in Echizen continues to be passed down through generations, and the dish remains a favorite in the local cuisine. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the Echizen recipes of crab and soba are still prepared today, as they continue to hold a special place as culinary delights cherished for their unique flavor and rich history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One of the best movies of the year with its extraordinary depiction of plight of Indian widows and their yearning for liberation.","completion":"The movie review appears to be about \\"Water\\", a film directed by Deepa Mehta. Released in 2005, \\"Water\\" is the third instalment of Mehta's Elements trilogy. It is preceded by 'Fire' (1996) and 'Earth' (1998). The film, set in 1938 and filmed in Sri Lanka, explores the lives of widows at an ashram in Varanasi, India. The plot of 'Water' revolves around Chuyia, an eight-year-old child widow who is sent to a home where Hindu widows must live out their remaining lives in penitence. Unaware of her status as a widow, Chuyia refuses to adapt to the regimented lifestyle enforced by the oppressive Madhumati, the head widow. Chuyia's presence reverberates throughout the ashram, especially affecting Shakuntala, a devout widow, and Kalyani, a beautiful younger widow who being the best looking is exploited by being prostituted. In its poignant portrayal of these women, their plight, and their yearning for liberation, the movie provides viewers with a vivid picture of the gender, theological, and social injustices of the time. It offers a deep exploration of the circumstances of marginalized widows, challenging societal norms of oppression, especially those existing due to certain interpretations of religion. The characters and their stories are constructed with depth and nuance, fostering in viewers a deep understanding and empathy. The cinematography, capturing the heartbreaking beauty of Varanasi along the Ganges River, is an integral part of the narrative, contributing to the film's wide acclaim. Perhaps what's most compelling about \\"Water\\" is its exploration of the dichotomy between tradition and change, between sacred and profane, and between freedom and enslavement. It is a deeply affecting film that encourages viewers to grapple with societal norms, tradition, and the interpretation and application of religious texts. \\"Water\\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2006, making it the first non-French-language Canadian film to receive a nomination in that category. It also won three awards from the Film Critics Circle of India. Despite its critical acclaim, the film was a subject of controversy and experienced protests from conservative groups in India. Undeniably, 'Water' is a significant work in global cinema, not just for its compelling narrative and cinematic beauty, but also for its brave confrontation of sensitive social issues. It undeniably fits the criteria of being one of the best films of the year, with its extraordinary depiction of the plight of Indian widows and their yearning for liberation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Confronted with evidence that key files were tampered with, the Government has reopened investigations into a possible cover-up involving suspected Nazi war criminals living in America. The investigations are being conducted by the Justice Department and the General Accounting Office. They concern allegations of a conspiracy to protect former Nazis and collaborators who may have been smuggled into the United States by American intelligence agencies for cold war operations against the Russians. Charges that the American authorities mishandled investigations of war criminals date back at least 10 years. But the G.A.O. concluded in 1978 that it could find no evidence of a conspiracy to impede the inquiries. Nearly 200 cases remain under investigation by a unit of the Justice Department, the Office of Special Investigations. Congressional investigators are also reviewing new information provided by a former prosecutor in that office, including long-secret military documents setting forth links that American intelligence agencies had with Nazis and their East European collaborators. Episodes described in the documents and other information collected by the former prosecutor, John Loftus, include these cases: - An Army officer working in intelligence after World War II acknowledged allowing some Nazi collaborators to falsify their applications for American visas in exchange for providing intelligence information. - Some former Nazis entered the United States through lightly patrolled Canadian and Mexican border crossings while others were routed through Argentina and other cooperative Latin American countries. - Other former Nazis arrived on cargo planes, after being listed on the waybills as freight. - One collaborator accused of killings was identified and barred from emigrating to America on five separate occasions by American counterintelligence agents. Yet with the help of other agents, he finally gained entry to this country. Mr. Loftus first made public on the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' last Sunday his charges that hundreds of Nazi collaborators were illegally brought into the country after World War II to form an anti-Soviet spy army. Masterminding the efforts, he said, was a highly secret covert operations agency close to the State Department called the Office of Policy Coordination. Mr. Loftus, who has written a book about his findings as a war crimes investigator, provided a draft of the book and documents to Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Immigration Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. The book is tentatively scheduled for publication later this year. Mr. Loftus is now himself the subject of Justice Department inquiries into his disclosure of possibly confidential material, according to a department official. Mr. Loftus, now in private law practice in Boston, denied releasing any material not properly cleared by intelligence authorities. 'Just Provided Records' ''I just provided Congress records they were supposed to get four years ago,'' he said. In the reopened Government investigations, the Justice Department announced last week that its criminal division was looking into the removal, apparently by the Defense Department, of certain intelligence information from at least two files in military archives. The files were checked by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, as part of its conspiracy inquiry from early 1977 to May 1978. They dealt with two Byelorussian emigres under Justice Department investigation for atrocities in the Nazi-occupied region of western Russia. The two, Emmanuel Jasiuk and Franz Kuchel, have since died. The tampering was discovered a year later by Mr. Loftus, who found material that the accounting office later said it had never seen. Mr. Loftus also found a note in one of the files: ''Do not disclose to G.A.O. until notified to do so.'' The note was signed only ''General Counsel'' and the Justice investigation is aimed at learning where the directive originated. One Justice Department official said the Defense Department was queried months ago but had been slow in responding. Denials From Two Departments Both the Justice and State Departments denied last week that they had attempted to impede any investigation. The accounting office, basing its finding only on material it had been shown, concluded in May 1978 that no ''widespread conspiracy'' existed to frustrate investigations of people suspected of being war criminals. But it found that nine suspected war criminals had worked for and been paid by the Central Intelligence Agency or the State or Defense Departments. After the disclosure last week that the files had been tampered with, Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called on the accounting office to reopen its investigation and the office complied. ''It looks like we were misled,'' said John Tipton, the accounting office's senior evaluator who also headed the 1978 investigation. The withholding of the material from him last time, he said, ''would lead to the fact that there might be a conspiracy, yes.'' 'Started Making Our Contacts' Meanwhile, he said, ''We've already started making our contacts'' for the reopened inquiry. He called the task ''pretty big - big as hell'' but said he had no idea yet how long it might take.

Answer the above question based on the context below: As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia.

On an alien planet, a band is playing to a packed audience; keyboardist Octave, guitarist Arpegius, drummer Baryl, and bass player Stella. (\\"One More Time\\"). A military force invades the planet and kidnaps the band (\\"Aerodynamic\\"). A space pilot called Shep is awoken from a dream about Stella by a distress call about the kidnapping, and pursues the kidnappers through a wormhole, where he crashes on Earth (\\"Digital Love\\"). The band are taken to an underground facility, where their memories are removed to disks and their blue skin changed to make them resemble humans.

Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. The feeling will come on gradually and may start to spread from your hands and feet up through your arms and legs. If your numbness, prickling, or tingling sensations do not have an obvious cause, such as sitting on your leg for too long or sleeping funny, you should talk to your healthcare provider. If your feet are numb, it can change the way that you walk. Over time, the change can affect your body in other ways, such as causing foot deformities or pain from an uneven gait. You may also get blisters and sores around the affected areas of your feet because you cannot feel that you are walking unevenly. You may experience sharp, jabbing, throbbing, burning, or freezing pain caused from issues within your nerves and not due to an injury. If you’re experiencing pain for no reason, it could be neuropathy. Since your nerves are not responding properly to sensations, you may feel sensations more strongly than you did before. Although this is rare, it could mean that a light pat on the back feels painful to you, or that a hug ignites your pain receptors. If this is caused by neuropathy, it will likely be a recent development and not a lifelong issue with clumsiness. Consider if you’ve been bumping into doors and furniture more often lately, or if you’ve suddenly started to fall down or trip for seemingly no reason. When your motor nerves are affected by the neuropathy, you’ll experience muscle weakness and possibly paralysis because the nerve can’t appropriately communicate with your muscles. In late stages of neuropathy, you may have trouble moving around, picking things up, or even talking. If your autonomic nerves are affected, you may have trouble regulating your bodily functions. This includes telling your body to sweat when you get hot. Your body may not sweat as often, causing you to overheat. Though these symptoms alone could be caused by a variety of problems, if you have them in conjunction with other symptoms like numbness or pain, they may indicate neuropathy. Neuropathy causes nerve damage, so your nerves may not be able to send messages to your body to tell it when to go to the bathroom, when to process food, and when to stop those functions. It’s possible that you may experience the following symptoms: Constipation Diarrhea Nausea Vomiting Indigestion Problems urinating Erectile dysfunction in men Lack of vaginal fluid in women If you have neuropathy, your body may be unable to regulate your heart rate and blood pressure, so it won’t be able to respond to changes in your activity levels. Your heart rate may remain high even when you are not exercising, and your blood pressure can quickly drop, causing you to feel dizzy. If you have dizziness or lightheadedness along with pain or tingling, it could be neuropathy. The dizziness and lightheadedness may be worse when you sit down or stand up. Summary:","completion":"If you start feeling numbness, prickling, or tingling in your hands and feet without any obvious reason, and it causes you pain, trouble walking, or issues with body functions, it might be neuropathy, which is a problem with your nerves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The rock fragments provide an initial clue to the events unfolding in the story, suggesting a potential threat or unknown danger connected to Winterton Flats. Additionally, this question highlights the investigative aspect of Professor Quatermass's character, as he seeks to uncover the truth behind these occurrences.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: how do you fix hunger? Choices: 1). eat a good sized meal. 2). take a nap for an hour.","completion":"To fix hunger, the appropriate choice would be option 1: eat a good sized meal. Justification for choosing option 1: Hunger is a biological response from our body that indicates it needs food as an energy source to continue performing its functions. By eating a good sized meal, we provide our body with essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, necessary for biological functions, growth, and overall well-being. This will effectively satisfy our hunger and provide energy for our daily activities. Why option 2 is not ideal: Taking a nap for an hour (option 2) helps in resting our body and mind but does not address the fundamental cause of hunger, which is the need for nutrients and energy derived from food. A nap might temporarily distract from the sensation of hunger, but it will not resolve it or provide the essential nourishment required by the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"They are generally used in fruit salad .\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"A melon baller, as its name suggests, is a tool used primarily for scooping melon into ball shapes. Usually made of stainless steel, this kitchen utensil commonly features a handle with a small, circular cup at the end, similar to a small ice cream scoop. While it's primarily used for melons like cantaloupe and watermelons, it can also be used on any soft fruit or vegetable, for example, papaya, mango, or even butter or ice cream for small, round shapes. The major application of a melon baller is to create ornamental pieces for food presentation, since the scooped out round balls of fruit or vegetable are visually attractive. These scooped pieces can be used for various purposes such as garnishing, in cocktails, or as part of a dessert. Saying \\"They are generally used in fruit salad\\" would be a reasonable answer, but it is not the only use for a melon baller. It can also be used to hollow out vegetables for stuffing, to core apples or pears, or to make uniform balls of dough for cookies or other baked goods.

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process is the formation and deposition of acid rain. When sulfuric acid (H2SO4) formed in the atmosphere mixes with water droplets in clouds, it creates acid rain. This rain, when it falls to the ground, can cause significant damage to ecosystems, bodies of water, vegetation, wildlife, and even human-made structures. Acid rain can disrupt the balance of nutrients in soils, lead to acidification and pollution of lakes and rivers, harm trees and aquatic organisms, and corrode buildings and infrastructure. Moreover, it can contribute to human health problems, especially respiratory issues, when acid particles are inhaled. In order to mitigate the harmful effects of acid rain, regulations and practices that reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and other pollutants from power plants and industrial facilities have been implemented in various regions worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Dial M for Murder Movie plot: Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is a former tennis player who married Margot (Grace Kelly) partly for her money. To please his wife, he has given up tennis and now sells sports equipment. Margot once had a relationship with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), an American crime scriptwriter, but broke it off when he went back to the U.S. for a year.In time they stopped writing to each other, and when Mark returns to London she tells him that she burned all his letters but one. Margo explains to Mark that the letter was stolen by a blackmailer who demanded £50, so Margot payed by mailing the money to a pawn shop location as intended, but the money was never picked up and the letter was never returned. Mark tells Margo that he wants to tell Tony about them so she can divorce Tony so she and Mark can be together, but Margot refuses out of fear of hurting Tony's feelings.It is also revealed that Tony and Margot have made their wills, naming each other as beneficiary with assets and money totaling £90,000. For a year, Tony meticulously plans Margot's murder. She has no idea that Tony knows of her love for Mark. He has gone to great lengths to steal a handbag containing one of Mark's letters, and even assumed the role of the anonymous Brixton-based blackmailer to find out whether she would pay to have it back. (She did, but he asked for only £50 and she did not, of course, get the letter back.) He even watched them having a little farewell party, eating spaghetti with mushrooms in Mark's studio flat in Chelsea.Tony slyly withdraws small amounts of money for a year, collecting £1,000 in (used) one-pound (£1) notes, with which he plans to pay a contract killer. He singles out the perfect man to do the job: Charles Alexander \\"C.A.\\" Swann (Anthony Dawson), who now calls himself \\"Captain Lesgate\\", a former acquaintance who has embarked on a life of petty crime since even before leaving Cambridge where he and Tony were both students. By following him and finding out about his past and associations, Tony soon gets enough to... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Dial M for Murder,\\" the character who makes several conflicting statements is Tony Wendice (Ray Milland). Tony is a former tennis player who married Margot (Grace Kelly) partly for her money and now sells sports equipment. Throughout the plot, Tony exhibits manipulative and deceitful behavior to carry out his calculated plan to murder Margot. He demonstrates his cunningness by creating multiple false narratives and conflicting statements to cover up his true intentions. For instance, he poses as an anonymous blackmailer to find out if Margot would pay to get Mark's letter back. Despite asking for £50, he never returns the letter to her. Another example of Tony's conflicting statements is when he tricks Charles Alexander \\"C.A.\\" Swann (Anthony Dawson) into a murder-for-hire plot with the intent of killing Margot. Tony uses his knowledge of Swann's criminal past to blackmail him into participating in the plan. Furthermore, Tony is very secretive and hides his true motives from his wife, Margot. She is entirely unaware of his knowledge of her past relationship with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) and Tony's year-long plot to plan her murder. He is successful in maintaining an innocent facade, making conflicting statements when necessary, and skillfully manipulates people around him to execute his plans. In conclusion, the character who makes several conflicting statements in \\"Dial M for Murder\\" is Tony Wendice. He demonstrates deceitful and manipulative behavior to orchestrate the perfect murder plan against Margot for his personal gain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(Associated Press) For the first time since 1983, the Dublin, Ohio-based fast food company is updating its logo in a move intended to signal its ongoing transformation into a higher-end hamburger chain. Instead of the boxy, old-fashioned lettering against a red-and-yellow backdrop, the pared down new look features the chain's name in a casual red font against a clean white backdrop. An image of the smiling, cartoon girl in red pigtails floats above _ though this girl looks more vivid and not quite as childlike. In an interview with The Associated Press, CEO Emil Brolick said the current logo had served the company well for the past three decades, but that it was time for an update. Still, Brolick said he was encouraged by consumer feedback in testing dozens of new logo variations over the past several months. \\"When we pushed things too far, they very much reeled us back,\\" he said, noting that it showed just how attached people are to the brand. It's only the fifth logo update since founder Dave Thomas opened the first Wendy's in 1969, and perhaps the most significant. The makeover comes as the chain known for its square burgers and chocolate Frosty shakes struggles to redefine itself in the face of intensifying competition from the likes of Panera Bread Co. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., which are seen as a step up from traditional fast food. Wendy's push has intensified since Brolick came on as CEO about a year ago. In addition to raising perceptions about its food, Brolick is focusing on renovating outdated restaurants with a look that features natural lighting, flat-screen TVs and a variety of seating options, including cushy chairs in nooks. The idea is to create a more inviting atmosphere where consumers feel they can relax. Starting in March, Wendy's says the updated logo will start appearing on newly built and renovated restaurants. It's still far from clear whether Wendy's broader reinvention will succeed. But sales at its restaurants open at least a year have edged up for the last five quarters. Craig Bahner, the company's chief marketing officer, notes that all brands need to evolve. \\"It's a tangible signal of change,\\" Bahner said. The Wendy's name and original logo were inspired by founder Dave Thomas' daughter, whose real name is Melinda Lou (her siblings couldn't pronounce her name when they were younger, so they called her \\"Wenda,\\" which turned into \\"Wendy\\"). Thomas thought the name conjured the image of the wholesome hamburger restaurant he dreamed of opening. In his book \\"Dave's Way,\\" Thomas recalls how the family dressed up Wendy, then 8 years old, in a blue-and-white striped dress for the opening of the first location. To make her pigtails stick out, they put pipe cleaners in her hair. That's roughly the image of the little freckle-faced girl in the logo. In undertaking the redesign, the company realized there were three key elements that had to be preserved; the image of the little girl, the color red and the way the \\"Wendy's\\" font swerves up _ what executives call \\"the wave.\\" In the new logo, Bahner notes that Wendy's pigtails peek out from the oval frame, bringing her forward and making her more dynamic. The logo will be part of the new restaurant design that Wendy's is looking to expand to its roughly 6,000 locations in North America. Brolick has noted that the revamps \\"enhance all dimensions of the Wendy's experience\\" and that renovated locations see a 25 percent bump in sales. By 2015, Wendy's plans to have half its 1,425 company-owned locations updated. Ultimately, Brolick wants the company to be seen as a \\"top-end\\" fast-food chain _ better quality than McDonald's, but perhaps not at the same level as Panera. \\"Our goal is to be a five-star restaurant at a three-star price,\\" he said. Building on the introduction of its sweet baked potato and Bacon Portabella Melt cheeseburger this year, the company is looking at introducing whole wheat buns and flatbreads. Brolick says those type of small adjustments can have a big impact on perceptions about the healthfulness and quality of the chain's food. The changes are even extending to employee uniforms, which will be updated next year to have a more tailored look. The early feedback is positive and Brolick says workers like them _ so much so that they even feel comfortable wearing them outside the restaurant. ___ Follow Candice Choi at http://www.twitter.com/candicechoi ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. |||||","completion":"For the first time since 1983, Wendy's, the Dublin, Ohio-based fast food company, is updating its logo as part of its transformation into a higher-end hamburger chain.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full name of the school Sir Alexander Mackenzie was principal of? Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first...

Spelt flour is indeed derived from spelt, which is a hexaploid wheat that has six sets of chromosomes. Spelt, scientifically known as Triticum spelta, is an ancient grain that has been cultivated for thousands of years. It is a relative of modern wheat, but it has different properties and nutritional qualities. Spelt flour has begun to gain popularity in recent times as an alternative to traditional wheat flour. It has a nutty and slightly sweet flavor, which makes it suitable for various recipes, including bread, pasta, and baked goods. The flour has a higher protein and fiber content compared to common wheat flour, contributing to its growing popularity among those seeking more nutritious alternatives in their diet. Furthermore, those with slight intolerance to wheat find spelt flour more digestible, as it contains a different type of gluten compared to modern wheat. However, it should be noted that spelt flour is not suitable for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance. In summary, the suggested answer correctly describes spelt flour as coming from a hexaploid wheat with six sets of chromosomes.

Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia. Arie Eddy, 18, has been struggling to find a job for almost three years and only managed to secure one job interview during that time. As youth unemployment continues to rise across Australia, more and more young people are struggling to find work. In Victoria the number of individuals under the age of 24 without work has hit a 15-year high, while in Queensland unemployment is also on the rise according to the ABS. Arie Eddy, from Warrnambool on the south-west coast of Victoria - about 260 kilometres from Melbourne, has been searching unsuccessfully for work for almost three years. 'It constantly makes me feel worthless. It makes me feel like I don't have any purpose and every day is hard to get through. I feel like I have no need to be around if I haven't got a job,' Arie told The Age. After leaving school in Hamilton at 16 to move south in search of a new life, the 18-year-old joined the military. However four months in he was forced out because he suffers from severe asthma. Victorian Council of Social Service chief executive Emma King told the publication the situation is also dire for graduates. 'They are continually told they don't have enough experience. We have a very competitive job market, they have done all the right things in terms of education,' she said. Over the past few years Arie estimated he'd applied for more than 780 jobs, but only secured one interview and remains unemployed. Youth unemployment rates are on the rise in many states, with the worst hit being Tasmania, followed by QLD. As a requirement of his youth allowance from Centrelink Arie must apply for 20 jobs each fornight, but so far it has been to no avail for the young Victorian. The Age report he receives 545 per fortnight from the government, but that is barely enough to survive once rent, bills, food, petrol amd asthma and depression medication are all taken care of. Arie said at least 30 of his friends are also struggling to find work, and his family in Hamilton are suffering financially too. While on youth allowance the government requires its recipients to apply for at least 20 jobs each fortnight. Now, after the hospitality course he was taking part in at TAFE was scrapped when funding was cut, he is considering following in his family's footsteps and getting into security. Arie's grandmother and aunts work in the industry and in six months time he will begin studying a Certificate II in security thanks to a course his employment agency has organised. With 95 percent of the cost taken care of, Arie is positive about the experience and hopes it will help turn his luck around and finally secure him a job. Despite Victoria's youth unemployment rates being at their highest in more than a decade, Tasmania is classified as the worst state for young people to find jobs. Queensland follows not too far behind. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Arie Eddy, an 18-year-old from Australia, has been trying really hard to find a job for almost three years, but it has been very difficult for him.

He gets some money from the government to help him, but it is not enough to take care of all his needs. Arie is now planning to study security so he can hopefully find a job in that field, just like some of his family members.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. . Find small ways to touch your guy to show him that you’re interested and leave him longing for more physical contact. For example, nudge him a bit with your elbow during a conversation or touch his forearm a bit when you're speaking. If he touches back, it’s usually a sign he's interested in you as well. While you want the guy to know you’re interested in him, don’t do anything that you’re not comfortable with. If touching him feels like too much at first, just try standing close until you feel more comfortable. . Fit little compliments into the conversation. Make sure that you mean what you say, though, because he’ll probably be able to tell if you’re just giving him a line. Look for moments where you can work what you admire about him into a the conversation naturally. When you first begin flirting, you can use somewhat generic phrases. For example, you might say, \\"It was so good seeing you yesterday!\\" As you get to know him more, work organic compliments into the conversation. For example, if he mentions that he's wondering what to wear to a sporting event over the weekend, you might something like, \\"You always dress really nice so I'm sure you'll find something great.\\" Smiling is a good way to come off as flirtatious. During a conversation, work on keeping a smile throughout. You can also try to laugh lightly at his jokes and smile more when he says something sweet or interesting. Eye contact can also help. Try holding his gaze for a few seconds and then glancing away. It may seem strange, but people are attracted to those who subtly mimic their body language. You don’t have to imitate everything he does, but mimic small, subtle gestures. For example, if you see him cross his legs, cross your legs too. Try mimicking hand gestures. If he tends to wave his hands around as he speaks or to make a point, try doing the same. If he is leaning in towards you, lean in towards him too. You may want to send your guy a physical note, but a flirty text can also work. Don't make it outright flirty if you haven't established that kind of relationship, though. Just show that you're thinking of him. For example, you might send a quick text that says, \\"Just wanted to say hi! ;)\\" You can also text or send a note with a quick question.

Article: How to deal successfully with a child showing outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage his gift. Many parents may even fail to recognize and respond to their children's need until discouragement explodes into uncooperative behavior. And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are especially able in academic subjects,the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school. Such children may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. The five music schools in Britain aim to provide all environment where gifted children can develop their skills under the guidance of professional musicians. Children here spend about half of a day on musical activities,for example,individual lessons,orchestras,chamber groups,voice training,conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practicing in private rooms .The rest of their time is taken up with the subjects:English,maths and basic sciences. What are the disadvantages? An obvious problem is that the fees are high .However, each school will often scholarships and other forms of financial aid. Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at an early age .Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such a tense and disciplined environment.

To do this, add 371v to both sides of the equation: 2359v + 371v + 32388 = -371v + 371v - 21813 + 248031 This simplifies to: 2730v + 32388 = 248031 - 21813 Step 2: Simplify the equation. Subtracting 21813 from 248031 we get: 2730v + 32388 = 226218 Step 3: Isolate the variable v on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 32388 from both sides of the equation: 2730v + 32388 - 32388 = 226218 - 32388 This simplifies to: 2730v = 193830 Step 4: Solve for v.

On the left side, we have two terms containing h (227*h and 20*h): 227*h + 20*h = 247*h The left side of the equation now becomes: 247*h + 4913 On the right side, subtract 2475 from 1213: 1213 - 2475 = -1262 Now, we have the equation: 247*h + 4913 = -1262 2.

Process: - The earth develops cracks deep beneath the surface - The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves - The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake. Question: suppose less cracks develop beneath the surface happens, how will it affect less stronger earthquakes. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"less effect. Explanation: Step-by-step thinking process: 1. Less cracks develop beneath the surface: If fewer cracks develop deep beneath the earth's surface, the amount of available space for the earth's crust to move and interact is reduced. 2. The cracks get very long and big in some places: With fewer cracks, the extent of long and big cracks will be limited, causing less movement and friction between rocks on both sides of the cracks. 3. The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks: As there are fewer cracks and less movement overall, the pressure exerted on the rocks will be reduced. 4. The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard: With less pressure being applied, the force with which rocks press against each other will be less intense. This means less potential for significant stress build-ups that would cause stronger earthquakes. 5. The cracks continue to develop: The development of cracks is limited in this scenario, so they may not develop as extensively, resulting in less interaction between the earth's crust along these cracks. 6. The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks: With less interaction between the earth's crust along the cracks, there will be less movement overall, reducing the likelihood of stronger earthquakes. 7. The pressure and movement around the cracks cause the rocks to crumble in some places: Since pressure and movement are less intense, there will be less crumbling of rocks. 8. A lot of energy is released: With less intense pressure and movement, the amount of energy released will be reduced, leading to potentially weaker earthquakes. 9. The energy causes seismic waves: With less energy being released, the seismic waves generated will likely be less intense. 10. The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake: As the seismic waves will be less intense, the resulting earthquakes will be weaker. To summarize, fewer cracks developing beneath the surface will lead to less pressure, less movement, less energy release, and ultimately less intense seismic waves. This will result in less severe earthquake events, or directly influence the second effect mentioned, i.e., the cracks getting very long and big in some places, by having a lessened effect on it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. - In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the northsouth position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Approximations employed. Two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \\"actual\\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard. - Kirkbymoorside is a small market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England, about north of York, midway between Pickering and Helmsley, on the edge of the North York Moors National Park.

Jack Harkness for the past two years. During the prolonged hiatus, Davies aligned the franchise with subscription cable channel Starz and moved the entire setting of the show from the U.K. to the U.S. OPTIONS: - British is keen to point out that fans will see Capt. - CNN is keen to point out that fans will see Capt. - Davies is keen to point out that fans will see Capt. - Doctor Who is keen to point out that fans will see Capt. - Jack Harkness is keen to point out that fans will see Capt. - John Barrowman is keen to point out that fans will see Capt. - Miracle Day is keen to point out that fans will see Capt. - Russell T.

He has a habit of getting too deep into his stories, which led to the collapse of his marriage. Jim is sent on an assignment to investigate a string of mysterious disappearances in a small town. Step 2: Establish the setting Upon arriving in the small town, Jim checks into the Whispering Pines Motel. The motel is a secluded and rundown establishment with peculiar staff and a few eccentric guests. As he settles into his room, Jim starts to feel that something is off about the motel. Step 3: Introduce a subplot While investigating the town and conducting interviews, Jim meets a local woman named Sara. Their bond grows as they find comfort in sharing their personal trials and losses. Sara's sister was one of the victims of the unsolved disappearances, and together, they hope to find some answers. Step 4: Present the main conflict One night, Jim discovers a clue in one of the missing people's personal belongings, hinting at a potential connection between the motel and the disappearances. In need of a secure place to report this lead, Jim realizes he must leave the motel room to make a phone call to his editor back in the city. Step 5: Create tension and suspense As Jim steps out to make the call, he senses that he is being watched. He chooses a payphone far from the motel to ensure his privacy. During the call, his editor informs him that they've found a pattern of mysterious deaths connected to the motel dating back decades. Step 6: Climax Upon returning to the motel, Jim and Sara confront the motel owner about the disappearances. The owner initially denies any involvement, but as they press further, he snaps and confesses to being part of a secret cult that worships an ancient dark entity. The cult sacrifices motel guests to maintain their immortality and power within the town. Step 7: Resolve the plot Jim and Sara escape the motel and inform the local police about the cult's activities. A raid on the motel leads to the arrest of the cult members, rescuing several captive victims and putting an end to the disappearances. Sara's sister, however, remains missing, and they vow to continue searching for her. Step 8: Closing thoughts The experience at Whispering Pines Motel leaves both Jim and Sara changed, and they find solace in their newfound friendship.

Charles V (Spanish: Carlos; German: Karl; Italian: Carlo; Latin: Carolus; Dutch: Karel; French: Charles, 24 February 1500 - 21 September 1558) was ruler of both the Spanish Empire as Charles I from 1516 and the Holy Roman Empire as Charles V from 1519, as well as of the lands of the former Duchy of Burgundy from 1506. He stepped down from these and other positions by a series of abdications between 1554 and 1556. Through inheritance, he brought together under his rule extensive territories in western, central, and southern Europe, and the Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas and Asia. In 1506, Charles inherited his father's Burgundian territories, most notably the Low Countries and Franche-Comte. Most of the holdings were fiefs of the German Kingdom (part of the Holy Roman Empire), except his birthplace of Flanders, which was still a French fief, a last remnant of what had been a powerful player in the Hundred Years' War. As he was a minor, his aunt Margaret of Austria (born as Archduchess of Austria and in both her marriages as the Dowager Princess of Asturias and Dowager Duchess of Savoy) acted as regent, as appointed by Emperor Maximilian until 1515. She soon found herself at war with France over the question of Charles' requirement to pay homage to the French king for Flanders, as his father had done. The outcome was that France relinquished its ancient claim on Flanders in 1528. From 1515 to 1523, Charles's government in the Netherlands also had to contend with the rebellion of Frisian peasants (led by Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijard Jelckama). The rebels were initially successful but after a series of defeats, the remaining leaders were captured and decapitated in 1523. Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of Tournai, Artois, Utrecht, Groningen and Guelders. The Seventeen Provinces had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were fiefs of either France or the Holy Roman Empire. In 1549, Charles issued a Pragmatic Sanction, declaring the Low Countries to be a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs. The Low Countries held an important place in the Empire. For Charles V personally they were his home, the region where he was born and spent his childhood. Because of trade and industry and the wealth of the region's cities, the Low Countries also represented an important income for the Imperial treasury. The Burgundian territories were generally loyal to Charles throughout his reign. The important city of Ghent rebelled in 1539 due to heavy tax payments demanded by Charles. The rebellion did not last long, however, as Charles's military response, with reinforcement from the Duke of Alba, was swift and humiliating to the rebels of Ghent.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What happened after Charles got all these territories?","completion":"After Charles V acquired all these territories, he worked on consolidating his rule over them. Through inheritance, he brought together extensive territories in western, central, and southern Europe, and the Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas and Asia. Charles issued the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, declaring the Low Countries to be a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs. This move aimed to make them a more integral part of his empire. However, the costs of fighting wars and maintaining territories strained his resources, leading to a series of abdications between 1554 and 1556. Ultimately, he divided his empire between his brother Ferdinand and his son Philip, with Ferdinand gaining the Holy Roman Empire and the Austrian Habsburg territories, while Philip received Spain, the Spanish Empire territories, and the territories in the Low Countries and Italy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The area of child psychology is one of the most significant and well studied of all the branches of psychology. It aims to help with achieving a greater understanding of the behavior of children through an understanding of their minds. It deals with children who range from the prenatal stage right up to the stage of adolescence. The psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980) has been credited with making a major breakthrough in this area when he put forward his idea that children were not actually less intelligent than adults, rather they just thought in a different way. Preciously the development of children right from birth through to adulthood was an area that was almost completely _ . In fact very little work was done in this area. However, interest in this field has now developed to the point of being one of the most debated of all the areas of psychology. Despite popular belief that factors such as genetics or personal characteristics are the only determining factors that influence a youth's behavior, this is not in fact the case. In reality, development actually includes many more factors than those contained within an individual. Factors such as environment, which can include social relationships and the surrounding culture, also play important roles. Relationships with both peers and adults will no doubt affect how children think and learn, and therefore develop. These relationships can include those that are found not only within families but also in schools and peer groups. Culturally speaking, this factor will contribute greatly to how children develop their personality concerning the values they end up holding (perhaps for a lifetime) as well as how they view such things as traditions and customs. Nowadays, psychologists have agreed that a child's psychology is both unique and highly complex. However, there are debates on many different points in this field and many viewpoints exist.

One helmet plowed into another. Dorsett's head snapped back, his helmet was knocked askew. \\"He blew me up,\\" Dorsett told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \\"I don't remember the second half of that game, but I do remember that hit.\\" Dorsett compared the hit to a freight train hitting a Volkswagen. These days Dorsett is worried about the cumulative effects of hits like the one Ray Ellis laid on him that day. In the past two years, Dorsett's memory has given him increasing trouble. On Monday, doctors at UCLA told Dorsett, 59, he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, the Hall of Famer said. CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. The only way to definitely diagnose CTE is after death, by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau, which has been found in the brains of dozens of former NFL players. Opinion: Why I'm saying goodbye to football. However, a pilot study at UCLA may have found tau in the brains of living retired players. Some scientists say finding the disease in the brains of living players is the \\"holy grail\\" of CTE research, providing a means to diagnose and treat it, and the UCLA study may be an important first step. Using a scan called a positron emission tomography, or PET, typically used to measure nascent Alzheimer's disease, researchers inject the players with a radioactive marker that travels through the body, crosses the blood-brain barrier and latches on to tau. Then, the players' brains are scanned. \\"We found (the tau) in their brains. It lit up,\\" Dr. Gary Small, professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and lead author of the study, said in February. Dr. Joseph Maroon, a neurosurgeon who works with the Pittsburgh Steelers, cautioned Thursday that the CTE diagnoses of Dorsett (and two other living former players) need further study. \\"This is very, very preliminary,\\" he told Sportsradio 93-7 The Fan in Pittsburgh. \\"There are many, many causes of dementia or progressive memory loss, particularly when you get over 60 or 70 years of age. ... It's something to obviously be concerned about, and the question is what can be done about it?\\" Dorsett said the diagnosis explains a lot about his forgetting where he is driving and his mood swings. \\"Memory loss, more so than anything it's been my big deal,\\" he said. \\"Sometimes you can have sensitivity to light and things like that. But my thing was not remembering. I've been taking my daughters to practice for years and all of a sudden I forget how to get there.\\" His daughters are afraid, he said. They wonder which father they will get. Will he be the happy dad or the one in a bad mood. For others known to have had CTE, symptoms include depression, aggression and disorientation. In 2002, Mike Webster, a Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers, was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE. After his retirement, Webster suffered from amnesia, dementia, depression and bone and muscle pain. What you need to know about concussions in the NFL. Unlike Webster, who spent his career smashing into opposition linemen many times a game and in practice, Dorsett was a superfast running back who made his enemies miss by darting past them or with a quick spin to avoid contact. He won the Heisman Trophy as college football's best player in 1976 and became an instant NFL star on the league's most popular team, the Dallas Cowboys. He played 11 seasons and gained 12,739 yards, eighth best of all time. His 99-yard run in 1982 is an NFL record. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994. Now he looks in a mirror and wonders. \\"And I say who are you? What are you becoming?\\" he said. \\"It's very frustrating to be a person that's been so outgoing, then all of a sudden, I'm like a couch potato.\\" Other athletes have demonstrated erratic behavior, such as Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk, 36, who died in a 2004 high-speed chase. Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry died at age 26 after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fiancÃ©e. Opinion: NFL takes good first step to protect players. Some who showed signs of the disease have taken their own lives, including former Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Andre Waters, who shot himself in 2006; Terry Long, a former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman who killed himself by drinking antifreeze; and Junior Seau, the former linebacker who killed himself last year at the age of 43. Dorsett said that won't happen to him. \\"I'm going to beat this. Trust me,\\" he said. Dorsett pins much of the blame for his health issues on team owners. He said a 765 million settlement of a concussion lawsuit with the NFL was not enough. \\"I can't put a price on my health. The owners knew (about the dangers of concussions) for years and they looked the other way, and they kept putting us players in harm's way.\\" The deal calls for the NFL to pay for medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, and litigation expenses, according to a court document filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. The agreement still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case, which involved more than 4,500 plaintiffs. NFL concussion settlement raises questions.

The clock on the dashboard reads 11:14 p.m. Suddenly, as he drives under an overpass, something smashes across the windshield, causing him to skid off the road. He stops by a deer crossing sign and gets out to inspect the damage, and finds a body with a badly mutilated face lying close to his car. When he sees another car approaching, he panics and drags the body out of sight. The car pulls up next to him, and the driver, Norma (Barbara Hershey), assumes that he hit a deer. She offers to call the police over Jack's protests, insisting that it's no trouble because she has a new cell phone that she 'never uses' and because she is friends with the chief of police. Norma offers Jack a ride to her house to wait for the police, but he declines. When she drives off, Jack decides to hide the body in the trunk of his car. He gets back into the car to pull away, but a police officer pulls up behind him. Officer Hannagan (Clark Gregg) speaks with Jack, and noting his odd behavior, asks him if he would submit to a breathalyzer test. Jack requests a sobriety test instead, which Hannagan administers. When the officer checks with dispatch, he finds that Jack's license has been revoked for driving under the influence. Hannagan tells Jack that he is under arrest and that his car will be impounded.

This commitment included continued financial assistance, training of Afghan security forces, and collaboration on security and counterterrorism efforts. Furthermore, the agreement opened channels for ongoing political, economic, cultural, and social cooperation between the two nations, laying the groundwork for a more stable and prosperous future for Afghanistan. The partnership demonstrated the resilience of the relationship between the United States and Afghanistan, highlighting a shared commitment to defeating terrorism and promoting peace and security in the region. In his speech, President Obama emphasized that the United States had no intention of maintaining a permanent military presence in Afghanistan. The primary focus was to strengthen the capabilities of the Afghan government, security forces, and local institutions to enable them to effectively protect and govern their own country. This approach reflected the broader U.S. strategy to transition from a military-led approach to a more sustainable civilian-led approach in Afghanistan, fostering long-term economic development, good governance, and the rule of law. The signing of the strategic partnership agreement was a crucial step in enhancing the U.S.-Afghan relationship, underpinning the long-term engagement of the United States in Afghanistan's peace, security, and development.

Please answer the following question: Good Genes Mean Long Life Scientists have discovered that living to the age of 100 may have nothing to do with the lifestyle you lead and everything to do with the type of genes you have. For the lucky carriers of \\"Methuselah\\" genes, worries over smoking, eating unhealthily and not getting enough exercise may not be as necessary as to those of us without the special gene pattern . The \\"Methuselah\\" genes could give extra protection against the diseases of old age such as cancer and heart disease. They could also protect people against the effects of the unhealthy lifestyles that we believe will lead us to an early death, scientists say. However, the genes are very rare. The genes include ADIPOQ, which is found in about 10 percent of young people but in nearly 30 percent of people living past 100. They also include the CETP and the ApoC3 genes, which are found in 10 percent of young people, but in about 20 percent of people over 100 years old. Some of those genes were discovered by a research group at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, led by Professor Nir Barzilai. The team studied the genes of over 500 people over 100 years old, and their children. The studies show that tiny mutations in the make-up of some genes can greatly increase a person's lifespan . Barzilai told a Royal Society conference that the discovery of such genes gave scientists clear targets for developing drugs that could prevent age-related diseases, allow people to live longer and stay healthy. David Gems, a researcher at University College London, believes that drugs to slow ageing will become widespread. \\"If we know which genes control longevity then we can ... target them with drugs. That makes it possible to slow down ageing,\\" he told The Times. \\"Much of the pain and suffering in the world are caused by ageing. If we can find a way to reduce that, then we are obliged to take it.\\" According to David Gems, _ . A) drugs to slow ageing will be very expensive B) modern science will be able to find more longevity genes C) it is the duty of medical scientists to fight the problems of ageing D) scientists can make new genes that will allow longer life Answer:","completion":"C) it is the duty of medical scientists to fight the problems of ageing"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South.

Second question: What does the present young generation feel about the hippie movement of the 1960s-1970s that shook the world? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: The name commonly given to the political and social movement that swept Quebec society in the beginning of the 1960s is \\"The Quiet Revolution.\\" This revolution, which took place between 1960 and 1966, was marked by significant social, political, and cultural changes in Quebec. The primary goal of the movement was to modernize and secularize the province, which was heavily influenced by the Catholic Church. The Quiet Revolution also sought to promote self-determination and the affirmation of French-speaking Quebecers as a distinct cultural and linguistic entity within Canada. Key achievements of the Quiet Revolution include the nationalization of the hydroelectric industry, the launch of a comprehensive welfare state, educational reforms, the establishment of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, and a series of labor laws to uplift the working class. The Quiet Revolution also cultivated a strong sense of nationalism and pride among Quebecers, eventually leading to a more assertive stance towards the Canadian government on matters of language, culture, and provincial autonomy. Second question: Young generations of today hold a variety of opinions on the hippie movement of the 1960s-1970s. Some admire the movement for its emphasis on peace, love, freedom, and environmental consciousness, as well as its role in pushing for social justice and progressive change, including civil rights, women's rights, and LGBTQ+ rights. The era's lasting influence on creative expression, including film, art, music, and fashion, is another factor that may appeal to younger generations. On the other hand, some young people view the hippie movement as an overly idealistic and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at societal change. They may criticize the movement's widespread experimentation with drugs, perceived lack of focus, or countercultural practices that were seen as nonconformist or rebellious at the time. For some, the movement may represent a bygone era that's hard to relate to or lacks the relevance to current social issues. These two questions are not asking the same thing. While both pertain to social and cultural movements of the same time period, the Quiet Revolution was specific to Quebec and focused on provincial modernization and the French-Canadian identity, while the hippie movement was a global phenomenon that encompassed broader social change and counterculture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: It's with great delight that I rate the application with package name org.smc.inputmethod.indic a perfect five-stars! Undeniably, it has shown that it's much more than a traditional keyboard app. Its stunning combination of functionality, user friendliness, and flexibility, along with a diverse linguistic support, makes it an unparalleled choice for those who communicate in multiple languages on a daily basis. The first noticeable quality of this app is its ease of use. Its clean, intuitive, and well-organized interface saves users from clutter and confusion. The setup process is straightforward and devoid of unnecessary steps. Its seamless integration with the operating system never slows down my user experience—it’s quite an achievement considering most of the other apps in the same category are not as optimized. One of the standout features is its support for a vast array of Indian languages. The app designers clearly know the diverse cultural landscape of India and have done an impressive job catering to that diversity. Typing in complex scripts becomes immensely easy—not only Hindi and English, but Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Telugu, and much more can be typed without a hitch. The transliteration feature only adds to the convenience, enabling individuals who aren't well-versed with a particular script to still communicate effectively in their chosen vernacular. The predictive text and auto-correct feature are like the cherry on top. The app seems to learn from what we type, making fewer mistakes with each use. This level of customization and learning prowess is something not common with many standard keyboard apps. What’s more, it also has an arsenal of trendy and diverse emojis as well, adding a more fun, engaging way to communicate. Privacy-wise, this application demonstrates great respect. It does not intrude on personal data and maintains user's data confidentiality with no room for compromise. This level of commitment toward user privacy is indeed commendable. In terms of stability, the app operates smoothly, with no bugs or crashes encountered during my usage. It has managed to deliver a consistently satisfying performance which speaks volumes about the development team’s attention to technical detail and user experience. In conclusion, the 'org.smc.inputmethod.indic' app offers an indispensable, efficient input solution for those who navigate multiple languages on their mobile device. I wholeheartedly recommend this app to anyone who requires a multilingual keyboard that offers accuracy, comprehensiveness in language choice, and a usage experience that respects user privacy. It's not an exaggeration to say this is a multilingual keyboard application that sets the standard for the rest. It definitely deserves a full five-star rating!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Context_1 : Split Rock Lighthouse State Park is a state park of Minnesota on the North Shore of Lake Superior. It is best known for the picturesque Split Rock Lighthouse, one of the most photographed lighthouses in the United States. Built by the United States Lighthouse Service in 1910, the lighthouse and some adjacent buildings have been restored and the Minnesota Historical Society operates them as a museum. The 2200 acre state park offers a unique cart-in campground and scenic trails for hiking, cross-country skiing, and bicycling. Context_2 : Baldred Rock ( ) is a rock in Fitchie Bay at Laurie Island in the South Orkney Islands. It lies close off the south side of Ferrier Peninsula, 0.75 nmi east-southeast of Graptolite Island. This rock was mapped by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition under William Speirs Bruce, 1902–04, and was later named \\"Bass Rock\\" owing to its likeness to the Bass Rock in Scotland. The name Bass Rock has also appeared on charts as an alternative name for an island in the Joinville Island group. To avoid confusion of these names, in 1954 the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee recommended an entirely new name for the rock at Fitchie Bay. Baldred Rock is named after Saint Baldred, the first hermit known to have lived on the Scottish Bass Rock. Context_3 : Black Rock Harbor Light, also known as Fayerweather Island Light, is a lighthouse in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States which stands on the south end of Fayerweather Island and marks the entrance to Black Rock Harbor. The first lighthouse at the site, built by Abisha Woodward under contract with the United States government, was a wooden tower that was lit and made operational by 1808. A storm destroyed the tower in 1821 and the current, stone lighthouse was erected in its place in 1823. The Black Rock Harbor Light was an active navigational aid until 1933 when it was replaced by two automatic lights offshore. The beacon was subsequently given to the City of Bridgeport in 1934. Two significant efforts during the 1980s and 1990s served to restore the aging tower and the light was relit as a non-navigational aid in 2000. Black Rock Lighthouse is listed as a contributing property for Bridgeport's Seaside Park historic district. Context_4 : The Bass Rock Lighthouse on Bass Rock is a 20 m lighthouse, built in 1902 by David Stevenson, who demolished the 13th-century keep, or governor's house, and some other buildings within the castle for the stone. The commissioners of the Northern Lighthouse Board decided that a lighthouse should be erected on the Bass Rock in July 1897 along with another light at Barns Ness near Dunbar. The cost of constructing the Bass Rock light was £8,087, a light first being shone from the rock on the evening of 1 November 1902. It has been unmanned since 1988 and is remotely monitored from the board’s headquarters in Edinburgh. Until the automation the lighthouse was lit by incandescent gas obtained from vaporised paraffin oil converted into a bunsen gas for heating a mantle. Since that time a new biform ML300 synchronised bifilament 20-watt electric lamp has been used. Context_5 : Split Rock Lighthouse is a lighthouse located southwest of Silver Bay, Minnesota, USA on the North Shore of Lake Superior. The structure was designed by lighthouse engineer Ralph Russell Tinkham and was completed in 1910 by the United States Lighthouse Service at a cost of 75,000, including the buildings and the land. It is considered one of the most picturesque lighthouses in the United States. Context_6 : New Brighton Lighthouse or Perch Rock Lighthouse, is a decommissioned lighthouse situated at the confluence of the River Mersey and Liverpool Bay on an outcrop off New Brighton known locally as Perch Rock. Together with its neighbour, the Napoleonic era Fort Perch Rock, it is one of the Wirral's best known landmarks. Context_7 : The Bass Rock, or simply the Bass ( ), is an island in the outer part of the Firth of Forth in the east of Scotland. Approximately 2 km offshore, and 5 km north-east of North Berwick, it is a steep-sided volcanic rock, 107 m at its highest point, and is home to a large colony of gannets. The rock is uninhabited, but historically has been settled by an early Christian hermit, and later was the site of an important castle, which after the Commonwealth period was used as a prison. The island belongs to Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple, whose family acquired it in 1706, and before to the Lauder family for almost six centuries. The Bass Rock Lighthouse was constructed on the rock in 1902, and the remains of an ancient chapel survive. Context_8 : Halfway Rock Lighthouse is a lighthouse located on a barren ledge in Casco Bay, Maine. The lighthouse tower, which has a height of 76 ft , and the attached ex-boathouse are all that remain, as the other buildings have been taken away in storms. The name \\"Halfway Rock\\" comes from the position of the rock which is halfway between Cape Elizabeth and Cape Small, the southwest and northeast extremities of Casco Bay, which are about 18 nmi apart. Context_9 : Ida Lewis Lighthouse, which was formerly the Lime Rock Lighthouse, is in the Newport harbor in Rhode Island. It is named after Ida Lewis, who lived and worked at the lighthouse from 1857 and was the official lighthouse keeper from 1879 until her death in 1911. She was celebrated for many acts of bravery in saving lives. Context_10 : Canty Bay is a coastal hamlet off the A198, in East Lothian, Scotland, situated opposite the Bass Rock and Tantallon Castle.

During the Age of Discovery, the Roman Catholic Church established a number of Missions in the Americas and other colonies in order to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the indigenous peoples. At the same time, missionaries such as Francis Xavier as well as other Jesuits, Augustinians, Franciscans and Dominicans were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. The most significant failure of Roman Catholic missionary work was in Ethiopia. Although its ruler, Emperor Susenyos, had publicly declared his conversion to Catholicism in 1622, the declaration of Roman Catholicism as the official religion in 1626 led to increasing civil war. Following Susenyos' abdication, his son and successor Fasilides expelled archbishop Afonso Mendes and his Jesuit brethren in 1633, then in 1665 ordered the remaining religious writings of the Catholics burnt. On the other hand, other missions were relatively peaceful and focused on integration rather than cultural imperialism. The first Catholic Church was built in Beijing in 1650. The emperor granted freedom of religion to Catholics. Ricci had modified the Catholic faith to Chinese thinking, permitting among other things the veneration of the dead.

In one study,researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people.The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night.They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours.And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin.Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry;leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies.They note the combination that limitation is common and is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised.People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy.But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially for high-calorie foods,so people gain weight.It seems that,for survival,the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep.

It is important to know where the information came from and whether the source can be trusted. In the absence of a reliable source, the premise alone may not be enough to establish the truth of the hypothesis. 2. Evidence supporting the claim: Are there any studies, official statistics, or reports confirming the claim that Lebanon manufactures the largest amount of counterfeit US gold in comparison to other countries? These documents would serve as concrete evidence to support or refute the hypothesis. Without evidence, any conclusion drawn could be based on speculation or anecdotal information. 3. Comparison with other countries: The hypothesis claims that Lebanon produces the most counterfeit US gold. To prove this, it is essential to compare the production of fake US gold in Lebanon with other countries, especially those known for producing counterfeit goods. 4. Techniques used in the production of counterfeit gold: Understanding the methods employed in creating counterfeit gold can provide insight into which countries may be more likely to produce large quantities. If Lebanon is found to use advanced techniques and equipment in producing fake gold, it could further support the hypothesis. 5. Enforcement of anti-counterfeiting laws: The prevalence of counterfeit production may also be influenced by how effectively a country enforces its anti-counterfeiting laws. If Lebanon has weak enforcement, it may foster an environment where counterfeit US gold production can thrive and result in a larger amount compared to other countries. 6. Distribution channels: To support the hypothesis, one would also need to look into distribution and trading channels for counterfeit US gold originating from Lebanon. If these channels are extensive and widespread, it could indicate that Lebanon is indeed a major source of counterfeit US gold. In conclusion, to determine the truth of the hypothesis \\"The biggest amount of fake US gold is manufactured in Lebanon\\" based solely on the given premise is insufficient. More information, including evidence from reliable sources, comparative data with other countries, and a comprehensive understanding of production techniques and distribution channels, is needed before reaching a conclusion that supports or refutes the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Information: - The mountain beaver (\\"Aplodontia rufa\\") is a North American rodent. It has several common names, including: aplodontia, mountain boomer, ground bear, and giant mole. The name sewellel beaver comes from \\"sewellel\\" or \\"suwellel\\", the Chinookan term for a cloak made from its pelts. This species is the only living member of its genus, Aplodontia, and family, Aplodontiidae. It should not be confused with true North American and Eurasian beavers, to which it is not closely related. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - The term Sciuromorpha has referred to numerous groups of rodents , but the only family common to all variations is the Sciuridae , the squirrels . Most definitions also include the mountain beaver . Traditionally , the term has been defined on the basis of the shape of the infraorbital canal . A sciuromorphous zygomasseteric system is characterized by attachment of the lateral masseter muscle along the side of the rostrum . Unlike hystricomorphous and myomorphous rodents , the medial masseter muscle does not pass through the infraorbital canal . Among extant rodents , only the families Sciuridae , Castoridae , Heteromyidae , and Geomyidae are truly sciuromorphous . Some authorities would exclude the Geomyidae and Heteromyidae from that list due to the attachment of the medial masseter directly behind the zygomatic arch. Carleton and Musser ( 2005 ) redefined rodent suborders on the basis of a host of both morphological and molecular reasons . They defined the Sciuromorpha as including three families , Sciuridae , Aplodontiidae , and Gliridae . Of these , only the Sciuridae are truly sciuromorphous . The Aplodontiidae are protrogomorphous and the Gliridae are myomorphous . The connection between Aplodontiidae and Sciuridae has been proposed numerous times in the past . The two families have been united into a common infraorder ( Sciurida ) or superfamily ( Sciuroidea ) . It has long been suggested that dormice ( Gliridae ) are not particularly related to the Myomorpha , and their zygomasseteric structure has been termed \`\` pseudomyomorphy '' . The connection between squirrels and dormice has been almost exclusively suggested through genetic studies , and to a lesser degree via the fossil rodent Reithroparamys . - The Eurasian beaver or European beaver (\\"Castor fiber\\") is a species of beaver which was once widespread in Eurasia. It was hunted to near-extinction for both its fur and castoreum; and by 1900, only 1200 beavers survived in eight relict populations in Europe and Asia. Reintroduced through much of its former range, it now occurs from Great Britain to China and Mongolia, although it is absent from Italy, Portugal, the southern Balkans, and the Middle East. - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population. What entity does 'sciuromorpha' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

Very, very few films were longer than that back then, but that is definitely NOT what sets this odd little film apart from the rest! No, what's different is that all the actors (with the exception of one frog) are bugs...yes, bugs! This simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder but instead this Russian production uses bugs (or, I think, models that looked just like bugs). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were yet to be discovered and I assume Linder was busy, so perhaps that's why they used bugs! Using stop-motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well--and a heck of a lot more realistically than King Kong 21 years later! The film starts with Mr. Beetle sneaking off for a good time. He goes to a bawdy club while his wife supposedly waits at home. But, unfortunately for Mr. Beetle, he is caught on camera by a local film buff. Plus, he doesn't know it but Mrs. Beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"No, the answers to these two questions would not be the same as they address different topics. I will provide you with detailed answers for each question separately. Question 1: Why do I create conversations in my head? Creating conversations in your head is a common psychological phenomenon known as \\"inner speech\\" or \\"internal dialogue.\\" There are several reasons why people engage in this form of mental activity: 1. Problem-solving and decision-making: Internal conversations can help you think through problems, weigh pros and cons, and evaluate possible outcomes. By imagining various scenarios and how people might react, you can better prepare for real-life situations. 2. Emotional regulation: People often use inner speech as a way of processing emotions, such as experiencing frustration, anger, or sadness. Imagining conversations can help you express your emotions privately and find ways to address them constructively. 3. Cognitive rehearsal: Inner conversations often involve practicing potential interactions with others. This mental rehearsal can help to improve communication skills and increase self-confidence in social situations, especially if you anticipate challenging discussions or confrontations. 4. Self-reflection: Internal dialogue allows you to explore your own thoughts and feelings, as well as evaluate your actions and behaviors. This helps you to better understand yourself and inform your choices, promoting personal growth and self-awareness. 5. Creativity and imagination: Creating mental conversations stimulates the imagination, which can be a source of creative inspiration. This can be particularly helpful for artists, writers, and people seeking innovative solutions to problems. In summary, creating conversations in your head can serve essential cognitive, emotional, and social functions, helping you cope with various challenges in your life and making you more adaptable and resilient. Question 2: What is known as an element? In chemistry, an element is a substance that consists of only one type of atom. Atoms are the smallest building blocks of matter and are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Each element has its own unique properties, which determine how it interacts with other elements to form compounds. There are 118 known elements, of which 94 occur naturally on Earth. Elements are organized in the periodic table, which groups them based on their atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus), electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. Elements can be grouped into categories such as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids, based on their shared properties. Here are some examples of elements: 1. Hydrogen (H) - The lightest and most abundant element in the universe, hydrogen forms water (H2O) when combined with oxygen. 2. Carbon (C) - An essential component of life on Earth, carbon is the backbone of organic molecules and can form an extraordinary range of chemical bonds. 3. Gold (Au) - A precious metal known for its unique properties such as conductivity, resistance to corrosion, and malleability, gold has been used for coins, jewelry, and electronic components. 4. Oxygen (O) - A vital element for life, oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration and makes up about 21% of Earth's atmosphere. 5. Silicon (Si) - The second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, silicon is a key component in semiconductors, which are crucial for modern electronics. In summary, an element is a pure chemical substance consisting of a single type of atom, and each element has its unique physical and chemical properties. The periodic table organizes these elements, helping scientists understand their relationships and how they interact to form compounds."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The tent, which had been erected amidst the rugged wilderness, served as a temporary storage and shelter for the traders’ goods. The man, whose name was Thomas, had stumbled upon this location purely by chance. He was an adventurer and had been traveling for weeks through the uncharted territories. Despite being weary and famished, he never veered away from his insatiable thirst for exploration and discovery. Today, discovering the tent filled with supplies felt like a small victory in itself. As Thomas deftly sliced through the leather of the tent, his eyes widened in surprise at the variety and amount of goods ensconced within its confines. The four large boxes were not just labeled with the names Hayworth Trading Company, Elysian Trading, Sterling & Co, and Narthex Imports, but were also overflowing with valuables and necessities. He couldn't help but wonder how these boxes had ended up here, in the middle of nowhere, and what had happened to the traders. Upon opening the boxes, Thomas discovered that the Hayworth Trading Company's box contained a mix of textiles, ornately embroidered fabrics, and rare animal hides. The Elysian Trading box was filled with a plethora of exotic spices and herbs. Intrigued by the seemingly endless supply of foreign goods, Thomas carefully and meticulously examined each item, making sure he didn't miss any hidden treasure. Sterling & Co.'s box revealed a variety of metal tools, intricately designed and of the highest quality. It was evident that the craftsmen who had forged these implements were exceptionally skilled, and Thomas knew that these tools could prove to be invaluable during his journey. The Narthex Imports box was laden with preserved foods in sealed tin containers, much to Thomas' delight. His appetite had been gnawing at him for some time, and he couldn't wait to indulge in a much-needed feast. Not finding any wine bottles or skins in the boxes was disappointing, but it barely dampened Thomas' spirits. He reasoned that there must have been another box with the alcohol, perhaps one that had been hidden away or had not been delivered yet. Nevertheless, he felt incredibly fortunate to have uncovered these supplies, and he knew that they would considerably aid him in the days to come. With an undeniable sense of satisfaction, Thomas began to strategize how best to utilize the newfound supplies as well as how to transport them along his journey. He pondered whether to use the fabrics for clothing or shelter, and how to ration the preserved food to ensure that it lasted as long as possible. The thought of bartering some of the goods with other travelers crossed his mind, allowing him even more resources and perhaps some much-coveted wine as well. As the day turned into evening, Thomas sat beside the tent, still filled with excitement about his discovery. The ingenuity and resourcefulness of trading companies and their ability to reach such remote areas inspired him, and he vowed to continue his journey with renewed determination. Regardless of the absence of wine bottles or skins, today had undoubtedly been a good day for Thomas, one that would remain etched in his memory for years to come."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Confusion: The core issue that the user highlights in their tweet is that they cannot follow a specific user and are unsure why this is happening. This uncertainty is reiterated by the use of both a double period and ellipsis (....?), showing the user's confusion regarding the situation. In addition, the fact that the user in question does not appear in the search results further contributes to the sentiment of confusion, as the reasons behind such disparities in the interaction between the two accounts remain unclear. 3. Frustration: Though frustration is not the prevailing sentiment in the tweet, it can be inferred from the user's tone. The user questions why they are not able to follow another account while the other user can follow them. This discrepancy might create a feeling of annoyance or irritation, as the user is unable to access and engage with the content they are interested in. Moreover, the inability to find the user in the search results may intensify the sense of frustration as it appears to be an unexplained issue regarding the platform's functionality. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet can be characterized as a blend of curiosity, confusion, and a touch of frustration.

Article: As Apple prepares to unveil both a new high-end and low-end iPhone next week, leaked ads from a telecom provider suggest the phones may launch in China as soon as this month. The WSJ's Deborah Kan speaks with Paul Mozur about Apple's new strategy in the country. As Apple Inc. prepares to unveil both a new high-end iPhone and a cheaper version for the first time next week, it is already working on something bigger. The electronics giant has begun evaluating a plan to offer iPhones with screens ranging from 4.8 inches to as high as 6 inches, people familiar with the matter say. That would be a sizable leap from the 4-inch screen of the iPhone 5 released last year, and, at the upper end, would be one of the largest on the market. Such plans signal further that the Cupertino, Calif., company is shifting its smartphone strategy as it searches for new engines of growth, and as competition with Samsung Electronics Co. intensifies . The Korean rival has taken a commanding lead in smartphone market share in part by offering an array of devices at different prices and sizes. On Wednesday, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 3 with a screen measuring 5.7 inches, a size that places the device in a category of hybrid phone-tablets. It is unclear whether Apple will ultimately choose to follow a multi-size, multi-device strategy beyond shipping a new lower-cost model for the first time later this month. The company often tests different devices and configurations before choosing a course. But people familiar with the company's internal deliberations and plans indicate it appears more willing to move ahead than in years past. Component suppliers say Apple already began testing larger screens for iPhones in recent months. Apple has been particularly interested in recent tests for a 4.8-inch screen, these people say. The screen sizes of the two iPhones that Apple is unveiling next Tuesday aren't expected to change, people familiar with the matter have said. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. A multi-size strategy would echo Apple's approach to the iPod, as that once-groundbreaking product line matured. Broadening iPhone offerings would also allow Apple to address a threat from Samsung: growth outside the U.S., where Samsung and rivals like Lenovo Group Ltd. are still expanding. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in April the company sees a \\"significant opportunity in China\\" with an unusually large number of potential first-time smartphone buyers there. Increasing sales in the country could also help Apple reverse stalled revenue growth and contracting profits, analysts say. Samsung and other competitors have released numerous products in different sizes and prices in order to cater to a broad swath of customers, particularly in India and China. Apple will for the first time begin shipping two new smartphone products this month, people familiar with the matter say; Samsung alone has released more than half a dozen around the globe so far this year. Apple has waged a public-relations campaign against Google Inc.'s Android software, which powers most Samsung smartphones. In March, just before Samsung's newest \\"Galaxy\\" device was unveiled in New York City, Phil Schiller, Apple's head of world-wide marketing, said the services and hardware on Android handsets \\"don't work seamlessly together.\\" Apple has also filed patent lawsuits around the world against Samsung and other rivals. Last year, Apple released its iPhone 5 with a larger screen, but analysts say changing the size hasn't been enough. Price, too, has caused the iPhone to lag competitors. Apple's newest iPhone starts at 650 without a subsidy; Samsung offers a range of smartphones priced at below 100 in places like China, India and Indonesia. As a result, despite rising unit sales for each of the top smartphone companies, Apple's share of world-wide sales fell to 14% in the second quarter from 19% the same time a year prior. Over the same period, Samsung's share rose to 32% from 30%, according to market research firm Gartner. Samsung's strategy underscores a competitive advantage: The South Korean company is able to bring products to the market more quickly than Apple because it controls the entire manufacturing process for its smartphones. Samsung makes everything from chips to screens at its own factories, allowing it to change designs and pump out new products at a rapid pace. By comparison, Apple relies on many suppliers to make parts for its devices and companies such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. and Pegatron Corp. in Taiwan to assemble them, requiring timely coordination between all the companies. Apple has some precedent in offering a wider lineup. About three years after it unveiled the first iPod in 2001, Apple launched the iPod Mini, a physically smaller device capable of holding fewer songs. The device was a hit, despite a plethora of competing devices on the market at a lower price, and it attracted many new customers to Apple's offerings. The even smaller iPod Shuffle a year afterward also caught on. Today, Apple maintains four different product lines of iPods and a healthy command of the music device market. The company also for the first time released a smaller version of its iPad, with a 7.9-inch screen, late last year. The standard version of the iPad made its debut at 9.7 inches in 2010. Apple has also been testing larger screen sizes for the iPad, people familiar with the matter have said. Since the debut of the iPhone in 2007, however, Apple executives have debated and tabled plans to offer iPhones in either lower-cost models or in different sizes, according to a person familiar with those discussions. Among the challenges it saw for a lower-cost option was that the company's designers couldn't find a way to make a device that didn't look cheap or look like a close copy of the higher-end iPhone, according to that person. Apple's business model has also been to produce fewer products, at what it argues is a higher quality. Steve Jobs, the company's co-founder who died in 2011, espoused this view often. \\"That's been one of my mantras—focus and simplicity,\\" he once said in a BusinessWeek interview. Later, he said he says \\"no\\" to 1,000 things Apple could do \\"to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much.\\" Apple has until now chosen to release a single new iPhone model each year, and a new case design every two years, in part to keep control of production costs associated with developing, testing and creating tools to manufacture new designs with the exacting quality the company is known for, a person familiar with the matter said. In recent months, Apple has said customers in emerging markets appear to like its cheapest smartphone, the iPhone 4, and has initiated trade-in programs in countries such as India to encourage buying. Mr. Cook said sales there grew more than 400% in the company's third quarter, ended in June. A person familiar with Apple's production also said the iPhone 4S is among the top products Apple continues to sell. People familiar with the matter say Apple's low-cost iPhone will begin shipping alongside the new premium model smartphone and it will be offered in multiple colors. The higher-end device, meanwhile, will include a new feature, a fingerprint sensor, people familiar with the matter said. A version of this article appeared September 6, 2013, on page B1 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: 6-Inch iPhone Screen? Apple Tests Bigger Sizes. ||||| With the new iPhone likely to retain the screen size of the current one, Apple Apple finds itself missing out on the fastest growing mobile-device category in the world: The hideously named but increasingly popular market for “phablets.” These 5-to-7-inch phone-tablet hybrids nearly outsold tablets and laptops combined in the last quarter and Apple got exactly zero of those sales. Though the company pioneered the touchscreen smartphone 6 years ago with a then massive 3.5-inch display, the iPhone these days looks tiny compared to the competition. And despite Apple’s reasonable arguments on the merits of maintaining a small screen for one-handed use, The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is testing prototypes as large as 6 inches, perhaps prepping its own phablet for 2014. The odd thing about the company’s stubbornness on iPhone screen sizes is that it has never expended much effort insisting users should take its products in one size only and accept it. While the iPod was introduced as a single model, over time it spawned many variants from the smaller Shuffle, Nano and Mini to the larger iPod Touch, which ended up becoming the most popular model. You can still buy Apple’s music player in multiple form factors, depending on your preferences, rather than being told, “music is only to be enjoyed on a player of this particular size.” In laptops, the company is arguably even more flexible. Not only does it offer three screen sizes — 11, 13 and 15 inches — but it also lets you choose from different models in the largest two of those. You want a 13-inch screen but the svelte Macbook Air? Fine. Need some more power but not a bigger screen? The 13-inch Macbook Pro is available for you. Like the 15-inch Pro model, you can choose whether or not you want the extra resolution of the Retina screen or the lower price of a standard one. The move to offer a second size of iPhone, though, would most closely mirror the decision to offer the iPad Mini, which comes with a 7.9-inch screen after the late Steve Jobs famously bashed 7-inch tablets. CEO Tim Cook explained that the Mini isn’t a 7-incher, which is technically true but also is evidence that Apple can change its mind and explain why it isn’t doing that at the same time. The company’s reluctance to offer a larger iPhone has centered on two problems, one physical, one technical. The physical problem is that once you increase the size of the phone from the current iPhone 5, the number of people that can reasonably operate the phone one-handed will shrink a great deal. Already, the decision to increase the screen height last year over the iPhone 4S made it difficult for a lot of people to go from corner to corner with a thumb. Like many iPhone users, I find this capability useful, but only to a point. It’s great when you just grab the phone and can do some things one handed. But typing accuracy plummets that way as does general touchscreen usage and it’s not clear that the loss of everything else a small screen keeps you from is worth it. This problem needs a resolution The technical problem, however, is trickier. Unlike on Android, where there are more than a dozen screen resolutions, Apple has basically two right now with the shorter and taller Retina displays. You either get 960 x 640 in the iPhone 4 and 4S or 1136 x 640 in the iPhone 5. Expect the latter resolution to carry over to both the iPhone 5C and 5S. Once Apple increases the screen size, though, tradeoffs arise. Assuming they stick with the 16:9 ratio common to widescreen TVs and the current iPhone, Apple has a few choices, none of which are great.

Write an article with the title: \\"OPEC is broken: Dennis Gartman\\"","completion":"Title: OPEC is Broken: Dennis Gartman Introduction: In recent years, the global oil market has been marked by volatility and fluctuating oil prices. This has raised questions about the effectiveness and relevancy of OPEC, the world's leading oil cartel. Dennis Gartman, a renowned economist and author of The Gartman Letter, has been vocal in his critique of OPEC's ability to fulfill its role in the modern economic landscape. This article will discuss Gartman's views on the reasons behind OPEC's demise and the implications for global oil markets. Step 1: Describe Gartman's background Before delving into Gartman's perspective on OPEC, it is essential to establish his credibility. Dennis Gartman, an American economist and commodities expert, has over four decades of experience in international markets. His daily newsletter, The Gartman Letter, offers insight into financial markets to a vast clientele, including banks, hedge funds, and family offices. Step 2: Present Gartman's criticism of OPEC Gartman's main argument against OPEC revolves around its slow reaction to the growing prominence of shale oil and alternative energy sources, as well as its inability to maintain market stability. OPEC, acting as a cartel rather than a competitive market player, has struggled to adapt to the evolving landscape of the energy sector. Step 3: Highlight the role of technological advancements Gartman argues that technological advancements and innovations have played a significant role in diminishing OPEC's influence. The shale revolution, in particular, has allowed the United States to rapidly increase its oil production, rivaling traditional OPEC powerhouses and weakening the cartel's ability to dictate oil prices. Step 4: Discuss geopolitical factors impacting OPEC In addition to technological developments, Gartman also emphasizes the impact of geopolitics on OPEC's decline. Rising tensions between OPEC members such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Venezuela have contributed to a lack of unity within the organization, further hindering its ability to effectively manage oil production and global prices. Step 5: Examine the significance of alternative energy sources Moving forward, Gartman suggests that the increasing adoption of clean and renewable energy sources could further challenge OPEC's dominance in the energy sector. With the world steadily transitioning towards sustainable energy, the cartel's grip on global oil markets may continue to weaken. Step 6: Analyze the implications for global oil markets Gartman's assertion that OPEC is broken holds significant implications for the global oil markets. As the cartel loses its influence, the era of oil price stability may come to an end, leading to increased market volatility and uncertainty. Furthermore, as countries diversify their energy portfolios, the traditional prominence of OPEC nations in the energy sector may wane, dramatically changing the geopolitical landscape. Conclusion: Dennis Gartman's claim that OPEC is broken is rooted in the organization's inability to adapt to the rapidly changing dynamics of the global energy sector. As technological advancements continue to reshape the industry and the global shift towards sustainable energy sources gains momentum, it appears that OPEC will continue to struggle to maintain its influence on the world stage.

Nepali mountaineer Ang Rita Sherpa last week broke his own record of the number of climbing Mt. Everest. Can we infer the following? Alison Hargreaves is the first woman to have made the climb up the Everest with no artificial oxygen.","completion":"While it is true that Ang Rita Sherpa, a legendary Nepali mountaineer, broke his own record by climbing Mount Everest multiple times, this fact alone does not necessarily allow us to infer information about Alison Hargreaves' achievement. To answer whether Alison Hargreaves became the first woman to climb Mount Everest without artificial oxygen, we need to delve into historical records and information about the accomplishments of female climbers on Mount Everest. Alison Jane Hargreaves, a British mountaineer, is known for her commendable ascents in the world of mountaineering, and she indeed made history. Hargreaves was born on February 17, 1962, in Derbyshire, England, and displayed an early inclination towards climbing, which she pursued professionally as an adult. In May 1995, Alison Hargreaves made headlines by becoming the first woman to successfully reach the summit of Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen or support from a Sherpa team. This remarkable achievement distinguished her in the climbing community and made her a well-respected mountaineer worldwide. Unfortunately, Hargreaves' life was tragically cut short when she died at the age of 33 during her descent from K2, another challenging and dangerous peak, later in August 1995. It should be noted that Ang Rita Sherpa's record-breaking climb and Alison Hargreaves' feat occurred independently from one another and that their historical significance is unrelated. While Ang Rita Sherpa's accomplishments showcase his extraordinary skill, perseverance, and ability to adapt to high altitudes, Hargreaves' ascent demonstrates the power and determination of women in mountaineering and the ability to conquer such a demanding summit without the assistance of extra oxygen supplies. In conclusion, we cannot make this inference based solely on the statement about Ang Rita Sherpa breaking his own record, but after researching and verifying the information, it is clear that Alison Hargreaves did indeed become the first woman to climb Mount Everest without the use of artificial oxygen. Both Hargreaves and Sherpa's accomplishments serve as an enduring source of inspiration for mountaineers and adventure seekers worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: What structures formed of twisted actin chains are found in almost every cell, and are numerous in muscle cells and cells that move by changing shape? A: OPTIONS: (1). RNA (2). DNA (3). vesicles (4). microfilaments","completion":"A: The correct answer is (4). Microfilaments. Microfilaments, composed of twisted actin chains, are found in nearly every eukaryotic cell, including muscle cells and cells that move by changing shape. They have a diameter of about 7 nm and are one of the three main components of the cytoskeleton, which also includes intermediate filaments and microtubules. Microfilaments play an essential role in maintaining the structural integrity, shape, and motility of a cell. The primary protein component of microfilaments is actin, a globular protein that can polymerize to form long helical chains known as filamentous actin (F-actin). The process of forming F-actin filaments involves the reversible polymerization of G-actin monomers, creating a dynamic structure that enables rapid disassembly and reassembly based on a cell's needs. The addition of G-actin to either end of a filament is regulated in a spatial and temporal manner, typically occurring at one end (barbed or plus end) while being removed from the other (pointed or minus end). In muscle cells, microfilaments are crucial for muscle contraction. They organize into contractile units called sarcomeres within myofibrils. Sarcomeres contain two types of filaments: thin filaments made of actin and thick filaments made of myosin, another motor protein. The interaction between actin and myosin filaments enables muscle contraction as part of the sliding filament model, with myosin heads pulling the actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere during contraction. Cells that move by changing shape also rely on microfilaments. They undergo a process called amoeboid movement, where cells extend membrane protrusions called pseudopods, which help propel the cell forward. Microfilaments support the formation of these protrusions, providing the necessary force. Additionally, the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments regulate cell membrane activities such as endocytosis (uptake of external materials) and exocytosis (secretion or release of materials). Microfilaments serve other significant functions as well. They form structures called stress fibers, which resist mechanical forces and help maintain cellular rigidity. In epithelial cells, they comprise cell-cell junctions (adherens junctions) and cell-matrix junctions (focal adhesions), which are crucial for tissue organization and integrity. In comparison, the other options provided are not composed of twisted actin chains: (1) RNA: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a single-stranded nucleic acid that is essential in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, gene regulation, and catalysis. RNA does not consist of actin chains. (2) DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a double-stranded helical molecule that encodes genetic information and serves as the blueprint for all cellular processes. DNA does not contain actin chains. (3) Vesicles: Vesicles are small, membrane-enclosed sacs within cells that transport, store, or process materials such as proteins, lipids, and waste products. They are not formed of actin chains. In summary, microfilaments, composed of twisted actin chains, are the structures present in almost every cell, including muscle cells and cells that move by changing shape. They play crucial roles in cellular shape, motility, and structural integrity, making them essential components of the cytoskeleton."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on.

Wilhelm II (Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert von Hohenzollern; 27 January 1859 - 4 June 1941) was the last German Emperor (Kaiser) and King of Prussia, ruling the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia from 15 June 1888 to 9 November 1918. He was the eldest grandchild of the Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and related to many monarchs and princes of Europe, most notably King George V of the United Kingdom and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Acceding to the throne in 1888, he dismissed the Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in 1890. He also launched Germany on a bellicose \\"New Course\\" in foreign affairs that culminated in his support for Austria-Hungary in the crisis of July 1914 that led in a matter of days to the First World War. The impetuous young Kaiser, says John C. G. Rohl, rejected Bismarck's \\"peaceful foreign policy\\" and instead plotted with senior generals to work \\"in favour of a war of aggression.\\" Bismarck told an aide, \\"That young man wants war with Russia, and would like to draw his sword straight away if he could. I shall not be a party to it.\\" Bismarck, after gaining an absolute majority in favour of his policies in the Reichstag, decided to make the anti-Socialist laws permanent. His Kartell, the majority of the amalgamated Conservative Party and the National Liberal Party, favoured making the laws permanent, with one exception: the police power to expel Socialist agitators from their homes. The Kartell split over this issue and nothing was passed. As the debate continued, Wilhelm became more and more interested in social problems, especially the treatment of mine workers who went on strike in 1889. He routinely interrupted Bismarck in Council to make clear where he stood on social policy. Bismarck sharply disagreed with Wilhelm's policy and worked to circumvent it. Bismarck, feeling pressured and unappreciated by the young Emperor and undermined by his ambitious advisors, refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with Wilhelm, as was required by the German Constitution. The final break came as Bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority, with his Kartell voted from power due to the anti-Socialist bill fiasco. The remaining powers in the Reichstag were the Catholic Centre Party and the Conservative Party. Bismarck wished to form a new bloc with the Centre Party, and invited Ludwig Windthorst, the party's parliamentary leader, to discuss a coalition. Wilhelm was furious to hear about Windthorst's visit. In a parliamentary state, the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to ensure his policies a majority, but in Germany, the Chancellor had to depend on the confidence of the Emperor, and Wilhelm believed that the Emperor had the right to be informed before his ministers' meeting. After a heated argument at Bismarck's estate over Imperial authority, Wilhelm stormed out. Bismarck, forced for the first time into a situation he could not use to his advantage, wrote a blistering letter of resignation, decrying Wilhelm's interference in foreign and domestic policy, which was published only after Bismarck's death. Although Bismarck had sponsored landmark social security legislation, by 1889-90, he had become disillusioned with the attitude of workers. In particular, he was opposed to wage increases, improving working conditions, and regulating labour relations. Moreover, the Kartell, the shifting political coalition that Bismarck had been able to forge since 1867, had lost a working majority in the Reichstag. At the opening of the Reichstag on 6 May 1890, the Kaiser stated that the most pressing issue was the further enlargement of the bill concerning the protection of the labourer. In 1891, the Reichstag passed the Workers Protection Acts, which improved working conditions, protected women and children and regulated labour relations.","completion":"This text is about Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor (Kaiser) and King of Prussia."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

In reading, fourth graders scored an average of 221 points, the same average score since 2007.That score is four points above those from 1992, when the first reading test was given. Eighth graders scored an average of 265 points, up one point from 2009 and five points from 1992. Education experts say reading is a harder subject to improve in the classroom than math. While math is largely learned in classrooms, reading results depend on how much kids read outside of school and how much they read in other subjects, such as history and science. On the NAEP, math scores were the highest among students who have limited use of calculators during math lessons, compared with students who have unlimited use or no use. Reading scores were the highest among students who said they read for fun on their own time almost every day. Question: In 1990, the fourth graders' average score on the math exam was about _ - 238 - 240 - 213 - 220 Answer:","completion":"In 1990, the fourth graders' average score on the math exam was about 213. This can be determined from the information provided in the article, which states that fourth graders scored an average of 241 in the most recent test, which is a 28-point increase from 1990. Therefore, subtracting 28 points from the current score of 241 gives us the 1990 average score: 241 - 28 = 213."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sylvia Plath (; October 27, 1932 - February 11, 1963) was an American poet, novelist, and short-story writer. Born in Boston, she studied at Smith College and Newnham College at the University of Cambridge before receiving acclaim as a poet and writer. She married fellow poet Ted Hughes in 1956, and they lived together in the United States and then in England. They had two children, Frieda and Nicholas, before separating in 1962. As Hughes and Plath were legally married at the time of her death, Hughes inherited the Plath estate, including all her written work. Hughes has been condemned repeatedly for burning Plath's last journal, saying he \\"did not want her children to have to read it.\\" He lost another journal and an unfinished novel and instructed that a collection of Plath's papers and journals should not be released until 2013. Hughes has been accused of attempting to control the estate for his own ends, although royalties from Plath's poetry were placed into a trust account for their two children, Frieda and Nicholas. Still the subject of speculation and opprobrium in 1998, Hughes published Birthday Letters that year, his own collection of 88 poems about his relationship with Plath. Hughes had published very little about his experience of the marriage and Plath's subsequent suicide, and the book caused a sensation, being taken as his first explicit disclosure, and it topped best seller charts. It was not known at the volume's release that Hughes was suffering from terminal cancer and would die later that year. The book went on to win the Forward Poetry Prize, the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and the Whitbread Poetry Prize. The poems, written after Plath's death, in some cases long after, try to find a reason why Plath took her own life. In October 2015 the BBC Two documentary Ted Hughes: Stronger Than Death examined Hughes' life and work and included audio recordings of Plath reciting her own poetry. Their daughter Frieda spoke for the first time about her mother and father. In 2017 it was revealed that letters written by Plath between February 18, 1960 and February 4, 1963 claim that Hughes beat Plath two days before she had a miscarriage in 1961, and that Hughes told Plath he wished that she was dead. The letters were sent to Dr. Ruth Barnhouse (then Dr. Ruth Beuscher).

The team played at Sick's Stadium in Mount Baker for one season before relocating to Milwaukee and becoming the Milwaukee Brewers. The city, county, and state governments sued the league and was offered a second expansion team, the Seattle Mariners, who began play at the Kingdome in 1977. The Mariners struggled in the stadium and moved to a purpose-built baseball stadium, T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field), in 1999. The Mariners have never reached a World Series and only appeared in the MLB playoffs four times, all between 1995 and 2001, despite having Hall of Fame players and candidates like Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, Ichiro, and Alex Rodriguez. The team tied the all-time single regular season wins record in 2001 with 116 wins. Since 2001, the Mariners have failed to qualify for the playoffs—the longest active postseason drought in North American sports, at 17 seasons. From 1967 to 2008 Seattle was also home to a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise: the Seattle SuperSonics, who were the 1978–79 NBA champions. The SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 2008–09 season.The Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held in Seattle twice, first at the Kingdome in 1979 and again at Safeco Field in 2001. The NBA All-Star Game was also held in Seattle twice: the first in 1974 at the Seattle Center Coliseum and the second in 1987 at the Kingdome.Seattle also boasts two collegiate sports teams based at the University of Washington and Seattle University, both competing in NCAA Division I for various sports. The University of Washington's athletic program, nicknamed the Huskies, competes in the Pac-12 Conference, and Seattle University's athletic program, nicknamed the Redhawks, mostly competes in the Western Athletic Conference.

Q:Information: - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation. - In theoretical computer science, a computational problem is a mathematical object representing a collection of questions that computers might be able to solve. For example, the problem of factoring - NP - hardness ( non-deterministic polynomial - time hard ) , in computational complexity theory , is a class of problems that are , informally , \`\` at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP '' . More precisely , a problem H is NP - hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H. As a consequence , finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP - hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all the problems in NP , which is unlikely as many of them are considered hard . A common mistake is thinking that the NP in \`\` NP - hard '' stands for \`\` non-polynomial '' . Although it is widely suspected that there are no polynomial - time algorithms for NP - hard problems , this has never been proven . Moreover , the class NP also contains all problems which can be solved in polynomial time . - In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \\"\\"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\\".\\" - Complexity describes the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions. - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'np-hardness' with the relationship of 'subclass of'.

It is said that the cliff holds a mysterious power that binds the entire town's fate. For generations, the townsfolk have lived peacefully, never daring to venture into the cave, believing that uncovering its secrets would unleash an unspeakable evil upon their land. Our protagonist, Alice, a young and fearless dreamer, struggles to live up to the expectations of her traditional family and her village. She's always been fascinated by the tales of the hidden cliff and all that it symbolizes. The more she tries to resist her curiosity, the stronger it grows, persuading her to go on a quest to uncover the truth behind the ancient legend. As the story unfolds, Alice rallies her band of unlikely heroes: her childhood friend, Sebastian, a brilliant but timid mapmaker; Luna, a rebellious huntress with unparalleled tracking skills; and Thomas, a mystical figure with the ability to speak to the spirits of nature. Together, they embark on a treacherous journey, facing trials that test their unity, strength, and resilience. Along their path, they encounter mythical creatures and mystical beings, learning valuable lessons about faith, courage, and the fragility of life. As they navigate through treacherous terrain and face challenging puzzles, they realize that their destinies have been intertwined since birth and that each of them possesses unique abilities that complement one another. As they venture deeper into The Wailing Hollows, the group stumbles upon the remains of a lost civilization that hints at an even greater mystery surrounding the cliff. This discovery urges them to acknowledge the complexity and depth of the legend, doubting the version that has been passed down for generations in Seraphim's Cove. Finally, after surpassing an array of challenges, Alice and her friends stumble upon the hidden cliff inside the cave. The cliff itself is a breathtaking, colossal structure covered with ancient runes that hum with magical energy. At the edge of the cliff, Alice finds a mystical stone that, when touched, unveils a powerful vision of the town's true history. The vision reveals that, centuries ago, the cliff was the primary source of magical energy for a benevolent race known as the Etherians. However, a great calamity struck that weakened the source of energy within the cliff, causing the Etherians to be on the brink of extinction. The Etherians knew that, in time, the cliff's power would diminish, and only a chosen few with pure hearts and strong spirits would be able to restore it. In an emotional climax, Alice realizes that her curiosity and dreams were not coincidences, but signs that she is one of the chosen ones mentioned in the vision. The group unites their newfound abilities and restores the power within the cliff. Their selfless act resurrects the Etherians, who grant them their heartfelt gratitude and eternal friendship. Ali and her friends journey back to Seraphim's Cove, changed forever. They assure the townsfolk that the hidden cliff is not a threat, but a symbol of hope and balance, teaching them that, in order to grow stronger, they must be willing to explore the unknown and embrace the wonders that lie deep within their own souls. The movie ends with the mythical cliff still standing strong as a homage and reminder to the people of Seraphim's Cove of what it means to dream, to believe, and to embrace the inexhaustible power of unity and hope."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Minutes after the calendar ticked over to this past 2014 New Year's Eve,Fyodorov set off on a solo,out--and--back marathon run from his home in the Siberian village of Oymyakon,completing the 26.2-mile course-his first marathon-in just over five hours.During the run he experienced temperatures as low as -38oC. And that was just the way he wanted it. \\"I heard about other marathons around the globe,naming themselves 'the coldest',like the most recent North Pole marathon with runners going at -28oC.'' Fyodorov told the Siberian Times.\\"I thought surely this cannot be right.Our Oymyakon is the coldest inhabited place in northern hemisphere.Why don't we arrange a marathon here?'' Oymyakon is widely considered to be one of the coldest places on the planet,and its record-low temperature of-68oC, recorded in 1933,is tied for the coldest recorded temperature for any inhabited place on Earth.The average January temperature in the area is -50oC. Not only did Fyodorov finish the marathon in high spirits,but he also wants it to be colder the next time he tries it.\\"I really want to organize next Oymyakon marathon in January when the air goes down to -50oC or -60oC,\\"he said. Fyodorov is not the first person to take on a cold--weather athletic challenge like this.In addition to the North Pole Marathon that he mentioned,the Antarctica Marathon is held every year in late February,taking runners on an out--and--back tour from Russia's Bellingshausen Station.A second Antarctica event--the Ice Marathon--has been held80F degrees south since 2006.

Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his...

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958 – June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \\"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches. Following his death, Glicken was praised by associates for his love of volcanoes and commitment to his field. Guess a valid title for it!

Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk?

A wicked tease on IMDb had said that it was a 'chick flick' but that your companion would survive. Survive? Yes. I am still here, but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours - it seemed a much longer evening than that! I suppose that, for Yanks, it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well, next to the beach, in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower. If that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film. There's a Monty Python film about a Knight who just won't die. He ends up a wriggling (why do Yanks add an third syllable to this word I wonder) torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis. This film is also about a sort of living dead. Vanessa Redgrave (inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here) goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt. She's not worried about having been a wide-eyed, breathless bimbo, but imagines herself a murderess. Obviously, being a girlie film, there's a chap who is supposed to be the Mr Darcy/Heathcliff character. I'm not a woofter, so I can't claim to be a good judge of such things, but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour. He's a bloodless cypher. As you might gather, the main characters aren't much cop, but the minor ones manage, amazingly to be much worse. There's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers. Fair enough, but it isn't the role of Hamlet - why ham it up so badly? Forgetting that it was a girlie film, I thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl-friend would have told him that face-fungus didn't flatter him, but then I realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a 'beard' because he looked worse without it. I kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery - if you're dragged along to it, see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head, just the sort of thing you'd expect in a beach cottage. Apart from the obligatory wedding, there is only one piece of action. You'd have thought that they'd have got it right. Sadly, though, the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn't be there. When the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can't know is nearby (but we do as the audience). If they don't have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place, then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him? I suppose that the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half-remembered dream sequence... Another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan.

The extra point was missed, but Campbell hit Thrash for another score later in the second quarter. The two-point conversion failed, leaving it 12-7 Washington. A Redskin field goal stretched Philadelphia's deficit to 15-7 in the third quarter, but L. J. Smith, who spent much of the early season injured, caught an eight-yard touchdown from McNabb. The Eagles went for two to try to tie it, but were not successful. Campbell fired back with his third touchdown pass, this one to Keenan McCardell, to make it 22-13. McNabb needed five plays to get the points back, launching a 45-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Brown for the touchdown. Ladell Betts fumbled the ball away in Eagle territory on Washington's next possession, but McNabb was sacked and fumbled it back to the Redskins on the next play. The Redskins eventually had first-and-goal from the three-yard line, but the Philadelphia defense had yet another huge goal-line stand, and Washington settled for a field goal to go up 25-20. The Eagles got the ball back with four minutes to play, and Westbrook immediately took a short pass and broke free for a 57-yard touchdown to go ahead 26-25 (the two-point conversion failing again). The defense came up big again, with Mike Patterson sacking Campbell to jar the ball loose, and Trent Cole recovering. Westbrook carried it in from ten yards out to seal the deal. McNabb, who surpassed Ron Jaworski for the most career completions in franchise history (2,090 at game's end), passed for 251 yards and four touchdowns in the 33-25 win. Westbrook rushed for 100 yards and had 83 receiving yards, with three total touchdowns. The comeback win improved the Eagles record to 4-5. Answer this question based on the article: How many points were scored in the first half?","completion":"In the first half of the game, the total points scored were 19. How we know is: Philadelphia's team, the Eagles, scored 7 points from the touchdown at the start. Washington's team, the Redskins, scored 12 points. They got 6 points from each of the two touchdowns, but they missed one extra point and the two-point conversion. So, if you add the Eagles' 7 points to the Redskins' 12 points, that gives you a total of 19 points for the first half."},{"prompt":"In this task, you will be given a short story.

It’s a sunny and warm day in Los Angeles—a bit of a weather shock to me after 11 years of Seattle’s cold and rain. I’ve been officially on the job in the web department for all of 12 hours. I’m sitting in a conference room at a big wooden table, surrounded by my new coworkers and team members in the Getty’s web group. A big monitor is displaying the prototype of the newly designed and almost-built Getty Iris. We’re discussing The Iris logo you see at the top of this page, its multiple iterations, and, quite frankly, the pain involved in trying to get it to look right. Wait-wait-wait, let’s pause for a moment. My name is Will Lanni. I’m a Web production specialist at the Getty, which is a complex way of saying I’m a developer and designer, which is a nice way of saying that I’m basically a “web monkey.” Before I started at the Getty, I worked as a partner in a small web design and development firm for several years. I had some experience working for the Getty—I built the Pacific Standard Time at the Getty site, the Pacific Standard Time Festival site, as well as the interactive Getty Impact map. And, at the time of my hiring, I was not only working on the new design and build of The Iris, due to go live in only a month, but also the soon-to-be-launched website for Pacific Standard Time Presents: Modern Architecture in L.A. So I wasn’t exactly new to projects at the Getty, even though I was a brand-spanking-new full-time employee. OK. Now that you know who I am, let’s get back to that moment. The Iris logo, and the hair-pulling it was causing for all of us—which is a pretty good representation of the steps that Web projects go through as we move from idea, to execution, to setback, to solution. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does Lanni think of starting a new job? Options: A. Lanni is confident in his skills B.

White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians.

And if he wins the nomination, such issues will almost certainly rise again, given that he will run against a war hero, in Senator John McCain of Arizona, who is advised by several veterans of the campaign against Mr. Kerry. Mr. Obama himself seemed chastened by the re-emergence of the old politics last week. “Let’s be honest,” he said in an interview on NBC. “You know, here I am, an African-American named Barack Obama who’s running for president. I mean, that’s a leap for folks. And I think it’s understandable that my political opponents would say, ‘You know, he’s different. He’s odd. He’s sort of unfamiliar. And what do we know about him?’ ” There is a subtext for this history lesson: Mr. Obama’s rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, is running hard on the notion that she is the more electable candidate, that what she calls her “baggage” has been thoroughly vetted, and that she has survived 16 years of the harshest Republican attacks. But David Axelrod, chief strategist to Mr. Obama, argues that any Democratic nominee will be subject to the same withering attacks on values and character. “The question,” Mr. Axelrod said, “is whether given the abysmal state of our economy, given the war, given all the challenges that people sense we face that have led George Bush to have the lowest rating ever, do you believe that voters are going to be distracted from the fundamental need for change? I think the answer to that is no.” In fact, as Mr. Axelrod suggests, these are very different times. Twenty years ago, the nation was in an era of comparative peace and prosperity; a sense of crisis did not hang over the election. Today, with the war in Iraq in its sixth year and the economy stumbling, more than 8 in 10 Americans say the country is on the wrong track. A new generation of voters have entered the electorate, who may not be as susceptible to values issues. In such a climate, it would presumably be far more difficult than in 1988 to keep the campaign focused on symbolic, values-related issues, or matters of personality. There are differences, as well, in the political skills of the candidates then and today: Mr. Obama rose to national prominence largely on the basis of his oratorical skills, and has never been accused of lacking vision; Mr. Dukakis based his campaign on a prosaic promise of managerial competence and “good jobs at good wages.” And yet, some veterans of past Democratic campaigns say, there are similarities, as well. Even with so many big issues at stake this time around, the race between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton has often been focused on questions of values, background and character — witness the recent fixation on Mr. Obama’s ties to the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., or the continued unfounded rumors that Mr. Obama is a Muslim. Like Mr. Dukakis in 1988, Mr. Obama is relatively new to the national scene, and thus vulnerable to being defined by Republican attacks. And like Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Obama lacks experience with the politics of wedge issues on a national stage. Attacks on a presidential candidate’s patriotism are hard for many politicians to take seriously. “Unless you’re talking about the Manchurian candidate, the idea that someone who put their heart and soul into running for president didn’t care deeply for their country is kind of ridiculous,” said Drew Westen, a psychologist and political consultant. Still, one of the clearest strategic errors of 1988 was the Democrats’ failure to realize that such attacks could stick and open the door to broader efforts to portray Mr. Dukakis as fundamentally out of sync with the nation’s values. “The attacks against Dukakis, which were systematic and attacked his patriotism, did a lot of damage to him,” said Tad Devine, a top advisor to the Dukakis campaign and the campaign of Mr. Kerry in 2004. “They developed words and phrases that essentially said this guy is not part of the mainstream.” If Mr. Obama is the nominee, Mr. Devine said, “I think it will happen again, and it will be aimed at both the candidate and his wife.” Michelle Obama has already drawn conservative fire for declaring that, because of her husband’s success and the voters’ hunger for change, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country.” And Mr. Obama has been questioned about why he does not wear a flag pin every day. In 1988, one of the central attacks revolved around the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. Dukakis, as governor, had vetoed state legislation in 1977 that required teachers to lead their students in the pledge. He did so on the basis of an advisory opinion from the state court, which said the legislation was unconstitutional. Mr. Dukakis, a Harvard lawyer surrounded by other Harvard lawyers, believed himself on very firm ground. But by August 1988, his Republican opponent, Vice President George H.W. Bush, was rousing huge crowds with a contemptuous question: “What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so much?” Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Bush said, was “out in deep left field on these issues.” He was also “a card-carrying member of the A.C.L.U.,” more concerned with giving furloughs to criminals — like Willie Horton — than upholding national values, the vice president asserted. “I simply can’t understand the kind of thinking that lets first-degree murderers out of jail on a furlough and won’t deal with the Pledge of Allegiance,” Mr. Bush said. Mr. Dukakis defended his patriotism and scoffed at Mr. Bush for wrapping himself in the flag, but, in essence, lost control of the campaign and his own image. After his loss, in 40 states, many Democratic leaders swore they would never be caught off guard that way again. Mr. Obama faces different issues, beginning with Mr. Wright, who suggested last week that the United States was attacked by terrorists because it had itself engaged in terrorism; Mr. Obama has now denounced his former pastor. He has been challenged, as well, about his relationship with a former radical from the 1960s; Mr. Obama says he simply served on the board of a foundation with the man. The questions may be taking a toll: The New York Times/CBS News Poll last week found 29 percent found him “very patriotic,” compared with 40 percent who felt that way about Mrs. Clinton, and 70 percent who felt that way about Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war. The lessons of history are fairly clear for Democrats, said Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council and a longtime Clinton ally. “Republicans have been trying to put us in the same box for 40 years now,” Mr. Reed said. “We win elections when we don’t let them.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: ’88 Campaign Offers a Lesson In Using Symbols as Bludgeons.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Among the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olhão. On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"three years\\" correctly answer the question \\"How many years passed between Portugal declaring bankruptcy and the assassination of King Carlos and Prince Luis Filipe?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"three years\\" does not correctly answer the question.

Plot title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: The young D'Artagnan wants to be a musketeer and for this he travels the long way to the city of Paris in France, where he will enter the same academy for musketeers that his father had attended. On his way to Paris, however, he meets up with Monsieur Rochefort. D'Artagnan does not know that his rivalry with Monsieur Rochefort will get him involved in a battle against the evil plot thought up by Cardinal Richelieu against the king and queen of France. When Cardinal Richelieu discovers that the queen had sent valuable diamonds to the Duke of Buckingham in England, a country enemy of France, the cardinal uses the information to blackmail the queen and create a difficult situation between her and King Louis, who now believes his wife to be in love with the Duke of Buckingham. Nobody knows that the diamonds are in possession of an old woman, Milady, who had stolen the diamonds from the duke and had brought them for Rochefort so that they would be nowhere to be found; Rochefort allows her to hold on to the diamonds in order to ensure this. Shortly after entering the academy of musketeers, D'Artagnan meets three of the finest among them, Porthos, Athos and Aramis. Though their first meeting had not gone well and had led to the challenging of several duels, the four of them become fine friends shortly after, since all four fight against the Cardinal's soldiers. When searching for lodging in Paris, D'Artagnan meets the lovely Constance Bonacieux, a good friend of the queen. Cardinal Richelieu orders all of the queen's closest friends to be arrested so that no one will be able to defend her once King Louis decides to have her beheaded. D'Artagnan defends Constance when a group of soldiers try to insolently have her arrested and then takes her to the safety of the queen.

Context: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him.

She offers him some tranquillisers beforehand but, unbeknownst to her, he spits them out. His mother drives on to the tracks.

Q: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients? === The answer to the above question is OPTIONS: -- Their blood pressure treatment protocol will stay the same. -- not enough information -- They will be enrolled in a study. -- They will call their doctor.

There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st. California already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices. The court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell. The drought around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce the effect of the price rise here. The 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing. Question: What caused milk prices in California to increase?

Please briefly summarize this news article: 6 ways to revamp your sluggish career To aid with visualization, the authors suggest creating a personal motivation statement -- a powerful phrase or two that is meaningful to you and stirs you to stay on track -- and reciting it whenever you feel like slacking off or are tempted to avoid the behaviors that will lead to greater success. \\"The first step to changing behavior is to make the distant future more salient, plausible and compelling,\\" Grenny notes. \\"For example, someone who has the goal to get a raise may have a personal motivation statement similar to the following: 'I would like to see myself as a talented contributor. I'd like to increase my income so I can buy X. I'd like to have the respect and admiration of the smartest people at our company.'\\" It also can be worthwhile to visualize a default future, a scenario of what is likely to be if you don't change your work habits. Imagining another mediocre performance review or the pit in your stomach when a co-worker gets the promotion you were eyeing can provide the incentive needed to take action. 2. Take time for professional development. Wishing is one thing, action is another. Identify the skills you need to progress in your career. Take classes and seminars accordingly, and read books to expand your expertise. Making yourself more knowledgeable and relevant can open up new opportunities and renew your passion (as well as give others a more favorable impression of your abilities and commitment). Remember your mother worrying about who you hung out with in high school? The company you keep in the workplace can likewise have a negative influence. Distance yourself from the office slackers. The bad attitudes and habits that are keeping you back are likely being enabled, tolerated or encouraged by others. Instead, evoke positive peer pressure by surrounding yourself with hard-working colleagues who share your career goals.

Since both -90*t and 13*t are terms with t, we can add them together: -90*t + 13*t = (-90 + 13) * t = -77*t Now the equation becomes: -77*t - 2388 = 1693 Step 2: Add 2388 to both sides of the equation. To isolate the term with t, we'll remove the constant -2388 from the left side. To do this, we'll add 2388 to both sides of the equation: -77*t - 2388 + 2388 = 1693 + 2388 -77*t = 4081 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by -77. Now we need to solve for t by getting it alone on one side.

However, upon using the app, I found that it was slow to connect to the Tor network, often taking a couple of minutes to establish a connection. I understand that the Tor network helps maintain anonymity, but I was still put-off by the apparent sluggishness. Speaking of anonymity, the app claims to offer robust security and privacy features, but it feels like it could still use some improvement in this area. It is worth mentioning that, on occasion, the app would automatically disconnect from the Tor network without any warning, potentially compromising privacy. The browsing experience within the app offered limited customizability. The absence of a user-friendly and customizable interface left much to be desired. Though the app provides access to .onion sites, the lack of reliable search engines presented difficulty in actually locating the desired content.

Washington (CNN) -- A seven-term Wisconsin congressman, who 54% of the American people were not aware of last week, just knocked the president of the United States off of his perch as the most talked-about politician on the largest social media platform in the world. According to the exclusive Facebook-CNN Election Talk Meter, Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, in the first 54 hours after being announced as Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate, sucked up the political oxygen in the social media landscape -- with the Beltway topping the buzz and his home state of Wisconsin close behind. What caught our eye? The swing states of Virginia (where Ryan was announced) and New Hampshire were also high on the list: Yet the growth wasn't just in buzz, but also in \\"likes\\" -- the","completion":"fundamental currency of Facebook. In the same 54-hour period, Rep. Paul Ryan experienced a remarkable surge in popularity, with his official Facebook page seeing a significant boost in both likes and user engagement. This sudden increase not only suggests that his selection as vice-presidential nominee sparked widespread interest in his background and policies, but also exemplifies the power of social media as a tool for political communication and outreach. Upon deeper analysis, one can attribute this phenomenon to a few interconnected factors. First and foremost, the announcement of Ryan's selection as Romney's running mate was timed strategically, ensuring that it would dominate headlines and social media conversations during a critical period in the presidential campaign. Additionally, the relative obscurity of Ryan prior to this moment amplified the curiosity and intrigue surrounding his candidacy, leading many users to seek more information on his policies and qualifications via Facebook and other digital channels. Another key element contributing to this social media explosion was the concerted effort by Republican and conservative-leaning groups to promote Ryan's candidacy and solidify support among the party base. These organizations leveraged their social media presence to share news, endorsements, and other positive messages related to Ryan, further amplifying the conversation and driving web traffic to his official Facebook page. Moreover, the geographical distribution of the social media buzz indicates that the Romney campaign's decision to make the announcement in Virginia and Ryan's connection to the critical swing state of Wisconsin were deliberate choices. These states, in addition to New Hampshire, are vital for Republicans to win if they hope to secure victory in the electoral college. As a result, Ryan's surge in Facebook activity serves as a gauge of political enthusiasm and support in these crucial regions. Lastly, the growth in Facebook likes highlights the importance of social media as an essential platform for modern political campaigns. As traditional channels of communication like print media and television continue to decline in influence, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have emerged as key battlegrounds where presidential campaigns engage with the public, respond to real-time events, and shape the narrative surrounding their candidates. As evidenced by the Facebook-CNN Election Talk Meter data, timely and strategic announcements can lead to dramatic shifts in online sentiment and buzz, allowing campaigns to capitalize on momentum and galvanize their base. In summary, the meteoric rise of Rep. Paul Ryan's Facebook popularity following his announcement as Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate can be attributed to a combination of strategic timing, effective messaging, and the power of social media as a platform for political engagement. Whether this online surge translates into electoral success remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: in today's digital age, social media's influence over public opinion and election outcomes cannot be underestimated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the core it is really hot. All that heat tries to rise toward the surface. In the Mantle, the rock is partially melted and is able to move. As it is heated, the material in the mantle moves toward the surface. As the mantle material rises, it cools. When it reaches the Earths crust, it is mostly stopped. A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all. Instead, it begins to move horizontally. The mantle material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. Toward the surface, the mantle material starts to cool. As it cools it sinks back down into the mantle. These areas are where deep sea trench occur. The material sinks back down to the core. The system operates like a giant conveyor belt. The motion due to heating and cooling is called convection.

I've only ever seen this film once before, about ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days ago and after watching it I think it is even better than I remembered it to be. Paperhouse is much more than just a horror. It had such an amazing level of emotion and great characterisation running through it. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really excellent here. It's such a pity that she hasn't done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether. Her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across, especially at the end when she realised that although Marc had died, she knew he was going to be alright. Several scenes did make me jump (which is a rarity for me in modern horror films), most notably the scene in the bathtub, the scene where Anna's father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dust. All in all, an excellent and very moving film. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"To describe the sentiment of this review, I would say it is overwhelmingly positive.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: In what war does Albert's mother claim his father died? First World War A:","completion":"Title: The Shadow of Memory Genre: War, Drama, Mystery Plot Summary: Albert, a young man in his mid-20s, has grown up knowing that his father, James, died in the First World War. His mother, Mary, has desperately held onto the memory of her late husband and raised Albert with stories of the great life James led, his bravery, and the love he had for his family. However, as the years go by, Albert discovers a war medal, hidden away in the attic, that raises questions about his father's true identity. Intrigued, Albert begins to piece together the pieces of the puzzle that was James' life, determined to uncover the truth about his father. Along the way, he meets Sarah, an aspiring writer, who shares in his quest for truth and completes the gaps in the story he uncovers. Together, Albert and Sarah discover that James was indeed a soldier in the First World War - but that he did not die on the battlefield. It turns out James was taken as a prisoner of war and, after a daring escape, he had been living a new life in hiding, ashamed of the haunting memories of war and the acts of brutality he was forced to commit as a soldier. Through a close family friend, whom Albert and Sarah interview, they learn that James was torn between the desire to return home to Mary and their child and the fear of retribution he might face for deserting the war. Ultimately, his devotion to the family led him to make a heart-wrenching decision: he sacrificed himself in a high-risk operation to save the lives of several fellow soldiers, thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of those who mattered. As Albert learns the truth, he confronts his mother and discovers her reason for concealing the true story. Mary, aware of James' struggles, wanted to protect her son from the darker aspects of his father's life. In her eyes, it was better for Albert to remember his father as a hero, fallen in the line of duty. In the end, Albert and Sarah choose to immortalize James' story in a book, detailing the complexities of a man, caught between his duty and love. The book becomes a bestseller and helps many families heal from the wounds of World War I. Mary learns to embrace the truth and finds new love with a kind-hearted veteran, while Albert and Sarah's friendship blossoms into romance, both finding solace in the memories of the past and hope for the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This move demonstrates the country's proactive approach in combating this highly contagious disease and protecting both animal and human populations. Step 1: Identify the Threat Canadian health authorities have identified an outbreak of avian flu, specifically the H5N1 strain, in poultry farms across the country. This disease poses a significant threat not only to birds, but also to humans who could potentially contract the virus. Step 2: Establish a Control Zone To effectively combat the spread of the avian flu, Canada has set up a control area, which is a designated region encompassing infected farms and surrounding areas. This enables health authorities to monitor and regulate the movement of birds, equipment and personnel within the zone, preventing further dissemination of the virus. Step 3: Implement Strict Biosecurity Measures Farm owners and workers within the control area are required to observe strict biosecurity measures to limit the virus's transmission. These include wearing protective gear, regularly disinfecting premises, and avoiding the transfer of birds between farms. The general public is urged to report any signs of sick or dead wild birds around the affected areas as well. Step 4: Monitor and Test Domestic and Wild Birds Health authorities will conduct regular testing and monitoring of both domestic and wild birds to determine the extent of the virus's spread. This entails collecting samples from live and dead birds and analyzing them for avian flu strains. Step 5: Quarantine and Cull Infected Birds Infected birds will be subjected to quarantine and culling measures to prevent further contamination. This helps to limit the spread of the disease to other farms and birds, reducing the potential for human exposure and fatalities. Step 6: Maintain Transparent Communication To ensure public trust and cooperation, the Canadian government is committed to providing accurate and timely information on the avian flu outbreak, control area, and containment efforts. This is crucial for maintaining proper preventive measures and addressing concerns from citizens. Conclusion: Canada's establishment of a control area to fight the avian flu outbreak is a testament to the nation's commitment to safeguarding both animal and human health. By monitoring the spread of the virus, implementing biosecurity measures, and maintaining open communication with the public, authorities aim to halt the outbreak and prevent future occurrences of the disease."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The fortifications of the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie were moved east of Utrecht. The town walls could now be demolished to allow for expansion. The moats remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact today. Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network. With the industrial revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond the medieval centre. In 1853, the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome, and Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more. From the 1880s onward neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, Wittevrouwen, Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West were developed. New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, several Jugendstil houses and office buildings were built, followed by Rietveld who built the Rietveld Schröder House (1924), and Dudok's construction of the city theater (1941).

Bean wins the first prize in a raffle - a holiday involving a train journey to Cannes, a video camera, and â¬200. Following a misunderstanding involving a taxi at the Gare du Nord, a railway station in Paris, Bean is forced to make his way unorthodoxly towards the Gare de Lyon to board his next train towards Cannes. However, a vending machine prevents him from boarding, and he misses his train, giving him an hour to sample French seafood cuisine. Back on the platform, Bean asks a man, who happens to be Russian movie director Emil Duchevsky (Karel Roden), to use his camcorder to film him walking onto the train. Bean makes a big fuss and keeps asking for retakes, so by the time they are done, the train is about to leave. Although Bean manages to get onto the train, the doors close before Duchevsky can get on. Duchevsky's son, Stepan (Max Baldry) is therefore left on board by himself. Bean attempts to befriend the boy, who has been told to get off at the next station, and eventually comes to his rescue at the station, unfortunately missing his train again.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2, Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance. Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets. Question: \\"How did the tradecraft of each of the 9/11 plotters go to fund the terrorist activities of 9/11?\\" Response: \\"They didn't provide any funds themselves personally. It was all provided by Al Qaeda and KSM\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct based on the paragraph. It states that KSM (Khalid Sheikh Mohammed) provided the 9/11 plotters with almost all the money they needed for the attack, and the funding came from al Qaeda. The plotters themselves did not personally provide funds for the terrorist activities of 9/11."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: When did Nine Inch Nails return to touring after its lead singer decided to cease touring with the band? ? Nine Inch Nails, an industrial rock band fronted by Trent Reznor, has toured all over the world since its creation in 1988. While Reznor—the only official member until adding Atticus Ross in 2016—controls its creative and musical direction in the studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to their 2013 tour, the band had played 938 gigs.Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart. Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist Alessandro Cortini said that \\"if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity\\".The only constant member of the live band is Reznor. Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been curated by Reznor with Rob Sheridan. Three tours have been chronicled on live albums and tour documentaries. Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points. Reznor decided in 2008 to cease touring with the band after a 2009 farewell tour. The band resumed touring in 2013, with the group planning a set of concerts in the U.S. beginning September 28.
