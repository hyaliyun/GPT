Please summarize it. Recent trailers for “Sonic the Hedgehog” include a fun scene with Sonic playing baseball by himself. The character moves so quickly that he can mimic plays by an entire nine-player baseball roster. It’s a perfect scene for a kids movie, showcasing the blue blur’s attitude and Flash-like powers. But in the context of the film, which comes out Thursday night, the scene is surprisingly moving. The thing that stops Sonic in his tracks is the sudden, distressing realization that he is utterly, hopelessly and painfully alone. Against all preconceptions, “Sonic the Hedgehog” is a sharp and very human tale about loneliness, and the limits of what you can accomplish alone. Sonic is from another planet, and he’s lived, in hiding, in a Montana suburb for 10 years. His joy is sustained through comic books and toys, but he longs for friendship. Enter Tom Wachowski (James Marsden), the sheriff of idyllic Montana suburb Green Hill. Green Hill is a sleepy hamlet, and Wachowski wants nothing more than to hit that thunder road and become a top cop in San Francisco. Sonic knows of Wachowski, but Green Hill’s top cop is oblivious of Sonic until circumstances bring the U.S. military and its top drone developer, Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to find Sonic and dissect him for science experiments. The plot eventually develops into a road trip movie as the protagonists travel from Montana to San Francisco. The movie’s tone, humor and quick wit will feel familiar for fans of Edgar Wright, director of “Hot Fuzz,” “Shaun of the Dead” and several other witty buddy comedies. Kids will be absolutely delighted. But older viewers (such as 38-year-old adults, like myself) will also find something here: The film respects its audience’s intelligence.","completion":"Although the character Sonic is a superspeed-wielding alien hedgehog, the film tells a very human story about loneliness. Sonic longs for friendship, which is where small-town sheriff Tom Wachowski comes into the picture. When the U.S. military comes to find and use Sonic in experiments Wachowski and Sonic join forces and take a road trip to San Fransisco in a buddy-comedy style adventure."},{"prompt":"I feel lethargic alot.

It's about the Tulsa Race Massacre. Governor James B. A. Robertson had gone to Tulsa during the riot to ensure order was restored. Before returning to the capital, he ordered an inquiry into events, especially of the City and Sheriff's Office. He called for a Grand Jury to be empaneled, and Judge Valjean Biddison said that its investigation would begin June 8. The jury was selected by June 9. Judge Biddison expected that the state attorney general would call numerous witnesses, both black and white, given the large scale of the riot.[120] State Attorney General S.P. Freeling initiated the investigation, and witnesses were heard over 12 days. In the end, the all-white jury attributed the riot to the black mobs, while noting that law enforcement officials had failed in preventing the riot. A total of 27 cases were brought before the court, and the jury indicted more than 85 individuals. In the end, no one was convicted of charges for the deaths, injuries or property damage.[121] On June 3, a group of over 1,000 businessmen and civic leaders met, resolving to form a committee to raise funds and aid in rebuilding Greenwood. Judge J. Martin, a former mayor of Tulsa, was chosen as the chairman of the group. He said at the mass meeting: Tulsa can only redeem herself from the country-wide shame and humiliation into which she is today plunged by complete restitution and rehabilitation of the destroyed black belt. The rest of the United States must know that the real citizenship of Tulsa weeps at this unspeakable crime and will make good the damage, so far as it can be done, to the last penny.[120] Many black families spent the winter of 1921–1922 in tents as they worked to rebuild. Charles Page was commended for his philanthropic efforts in the wake of the riot in the assistance of 'destitute blacks'.[122] A group of influential white developers persuaded the city to pass a fire ordinance that would have prohibited many black people from rebuilding in Greenwood. Their intention was to redevelop Greenwood for more business and industrial use and force black people further to the edge of the city for residences. The case was litigated and appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court by Buck Colbert Franklin, where the ordinance was ruled unconstitutional. Most of the promised funding was never raised for the black residents, and they struggled to rebuild after the violence. Willows, the regional director of the Red Cross, noted this in his report, explaining his slow initial progress to facilitate the rehabilitation of the refugees. The fire code was officially intended to prevent another tragedy by banning wooden frame construction houses in place of previously burnt homes. A concession was granted to allow temporary wooden frame dwellings while a new building, which would meet the more restrictive fire code, was being constructed. This was quickly halted as residents within two weeks had started to erect full-sized wooden frame dwellings in contravention of the agreement. It took a further two-month delay to secure the court decision to reinstate the previous fire code. Willows heavily criticized the Tulsa city officials for interfering with his efforts, for their role in the Public Welfare Committee which first sought to rezone the \\"burned area\\" as industrial, and for constructing a union station in its place with no consideration for the refugees. Then he criticized them again for the dissolution of the Public Welfare Committee in favor of the formation of the Reconstruction Committee which failed to formulate a single plan, leaving the displaced residents prohibited from beginning reconstruction efforts for several months.[123]","completion":"In the aftermath of the Tulsa Race Massacre, a Grand Jury investigated the issue over twelve days, ultimately ruling that the riot had been the result of black mobs. Though law enforcement was also implicated in failing to prevent the riot, no one was ever charged for the violence or property damage. On June 3, businessmen and civic leaders met to discuss raising funds and aid for rebuilding Greenwood, claiming that Tulsa had just suffered something worthy of shame and humiliation and restitution was their only way to recover. Despite this resolve, many black families were forced to live in tents during the winter of 1921-1922 as they worked to rebuild the district. On top of that, a group of influential white developers passed a fire ordinance that would prohibit full-sized wooden frame buildings to be constructed in the area, making it nearly impossible for most of the black families to rebuild. These developers wanted to redevelop the area for business and industry so that black people would be forced to move further from the center of the city."},{"prompt":"In New Orleans, Lousiana do they have a distinct dialect or speak a different language other than English? If so, could explain what they are and their origin?","completion":"To answer your question, \\"In New Orleans, Lousiana, do they have distinct dialects or speak a different language other than English?\\" the answer is yes. Here is a list of the dialect and languages spoken in New Orleans and their origin: 1. Cajun English - The Cajun people are of Acadian heritage and immigrants to Nova Scotia. When the first batch of Cajuns settled in Louisiana, they traded with English-speaking traders in the area using a language of commerce and trade called Cajun English. 2. Yat - This is more of a dialect than a language but significantly differs from regular spoken English. Yat is spoken only in the New Orleans metro area and can vary considerably based on the accent of Italian and Irish immigrants who reside around the port city. 3. French and other varieties - French was spoken in Louisiana for 80 years before the state adapted to many different varieties of cultures. The French spoke Cajun French, and Creole was from a mix of French Creole. This eventually became known as Cajun French. Very few still speak Cajun French, but it is still used in some areas of southern Louisiana."},{"prompt":"I want to become an Instagram influencer. Brainstorm four ways that I can market myself.

To create your own module to use in Python, you first need to write a script that has the functions you want to use. You save those functions as \`module_name.py\`, replacing \\"module_name\\" with the name you want the module to have when you import it. The \`.py\` extension saves it as a Python file, which allows you to import the module as you would any other module you have installed. Then you can use the functions you created without including them directly in your script. For example: # Create a function def new_function(world): print(f\\"Hello, {world}.\\") You create the function \`new_function(world)\` in Python and save it as \`hello.py\`. Then you open a new Python script and enter the following, using the module name and the new function: # Import hello.py import hello # Use the function you created hello.new_function(\\"Maker\\") This will give you the output, \\"Hello, Maker.\\" You can use modules for functions, dictionaries, or any object that you will reuse in multiple scripts to keep your code more concise."},{"prompt":"Can you walk me through what this TS function does? export function debounce<T extends ReadonlyArray<any>>(callback: (...args: T) => unknown, delay: number) { let timeout: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | undefined; return (...args: T) => { if (timeout) return; timeout = setTimeout(() => { callback(...args); timeout = undefined; }, delay); }; }","completion":"This function returns a wrapper function around a provided callback preventing it from being called more than once in a given period.

Clothing - The types of clothes you and your attendees wear will add to the immersion of the scene. Use popular 80s clothes with pastel colors and earth tones. Jams (jeans shorts), leotards, spandex and jelly shoes are great items of apparel. 3. Movies and television shows - Get some LCD flat-screen TVs (or even \\"old school\\" CRT tube televisions) and play popular 80s movies and televisions on them (Miami Vice, The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire). 4. Lingo - If you look the part, you should also speak the part. That means using the language and slang of the 1980s. Use words and phrases such as \\"gnarly\\", \\"tubular\\", \\"awesome\\" and \\"radical\\". Greet your attendees with a high five and a \\"How's it hanging?\\" and \\"Sick dude!\\" 5. Games - You can play games with the other attendees that were very popular back in the 80s, including Twister and Parcheesi. Or, if you are feeling adventurous, rent some arcade machines like Pac-Man or pinball and place them in the venue for attendees to have hours of fun!"},{"prompt":"Write a short story about a vegetarian ogre who's just trying to live peacefully, but knights from the nearby kingdom keep trying to attack her and reclaim the bridge.

Situated on the Northern shore of Great Slave Lake, Yellowknife is the capital of the Northwest Territories and the largest city in the NWT. Founded in 1934, the city is located in the traditional territory of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation who founded the nearby community of Dettah in the early 1930s. Regardless of what time of year you visit, there's always something happening in Yellowknife. From a weekend music festival in the sand to a month of festivities inside a snow castle on the frozen bay, the capital of the Northwest Territories is a vibrant and cosmopolitan northern city. Here you'll find excellent restaurants, comfy accommodations and a whole host of colourful locals. One of the best things about Yellowknife, though, is its location. The bustling streets are filled with trendy shops and public art, but take a few steps out of town and you're surrounded by untouched northern wilderness. In Yellowknife, you're never more than a few minutes away from a new adventure. The city gets its name from the copper tools historically made and traded by the local Dene. The most common Dene name for Yellowknife is \\"Somba K'e,\\" which translates to \\"Where the money is.\\" It's a fitting title for a town with a gold-mining history. Yellowknife was officially founded in 1934, when the area today called Old Town was little more than a few cabins and a rough-and-tumble mining camp. It evolved into the seat of the territorial government—a legacy still on display at the Legislative Assembly—before another mining boom arrived in the '90s with the discovery of nearby diamond deposits. Today, tourism is one of the biggest draws to Yellowknife. Visitors come from all over the world to experience Yellowknife's incredible attractions. Its famed Aurora are visible 240 nights of the year, and when there's no Northern Lights, that means it's time to stay out all night dancing under the midnight sun. Does it get cold? Oh, you bet. But that doesn't stop Yellowknifers from having fun all winter long. Yellowknife is also the perfect launching point for northern adventures outside of the city. A wide array of trails, lodges, campgrounds, bush plane tours, and secret fishing spots are all easily accessible from this free-spirited community. And it's friendly too. Make your way to any Yellowknife establishment and you'll find locals eager to advise you of how to get the most out of your visit. You'll be so full of suggestions for great meals, gorgeous hikes, fabulous handmade arts and crafts and truly unique experiences, you'll be wondering how you can extend your stay in this vibrant and culturally-diverse city. The City of Yellowknife has additional up-to-date resources and information about local events, accommodations, and amenities at extraordinaryyk.com as well as municipal information at yellowknife.ca.

He had decided that morning before their daily brunch date that today was the day. He left his apartment and went to the flower shop on the corner.

He selected the blue and yellow ones because he knew those were her favorite colors and then returned to the apartment building to pick up Ann. He felt his heart beating fast as he knocked on her door. He'd play it by ear. Even if she seemed put off by the flowers, he could just say he was getting them for her for another reason. When Ann answered the door he was greeted with her smile. He sighed with relief and handed her the flowers. She invited him inside while she put them in a vase and then they went to brunch. While they were eating George decided to ask Ann if she was going to take the job. She seemed hesitant about the idea of moving far away. Seeing this as his \\"in,\\" he decided to tell Ann how he had loved her their entire lives. Ann took a moment to respond, causing George to feel even more nervous.

Suggest four genres that would be a great start for a new flash fiction writer.","completion":"Flash fiction is a story that flows from beginning to end in 500 to 1,000 words, or much less. Also referred to as \\"micro-fiction,\\" flash fiction is a niche writing style that requires a writer to tell a complete story within a set word count. Writers use this type of fiction as a creative writing tool to develop conciseness in their style of telling a story. One way to get into writing flash fiction is to flesh out a short story of several pages, then whittle the story down to precise details. When you write and edit a short story, you’ll find that many descriptive elements can be cut in favor of getting to the point of the story for the reader. On the flip side, flash fiction is most popular with readers who love stories and books but have limited time to enjoy them. The following story genres could jumpstart the creative process of prospective flash fiction writers: • Romance • Thriller • Horror • Science Fiction These genres are great for flash fiction because they are predominantly imaginative and creative. You can simply allow yourself to write without much thought, then go back and edit where necessary. Plus, you can incorporate real-life experiences into fictional stories."},{"prompt":"Write a short story about 3 teens from a small town who discover a Haunted House, including dialogue and write the story in an ominous tone.","completion":"It was a misty fall evening in the small town of Creepton and three teenage friends cycled through the deserted streets. Steve, the eldest and wisest of the friends, always rode at the front of the pack with Sally close behind. Sally was scared of most things, however being left alone was her biggest fear. Last in the pack was Jack. Jack had a vivid imagination and a strong sense of adventure which often got him into trouble. As the friends meandered through the hazy streets, the air grew even colder and something just felt off. \\"I think I might go home guys, but I need you to take me\\", whimpered Sally. Steve of course obliged but Jack had other ideas, \\"OK fine, but let's go a different route, it'll be more fun!\\" he said. Steve looked at Sally and sighed, \\"Well, one way or another, we'll get you home safely\\". The three young friends set off down a road they were unfamiliar with, the street sign was barely legible through all the cobwebs and moss. Jack paused to read the sign when he realized, it wasn't a street sign at all, it was a warning that read, \\"Do Not Enter\\". Jack decided not to share this information with the group, they were on an adventure after all. The group cautiously cycled down the unkempt road, it seemed as though nobody had been there in years. As the heavy mist cleared, a sense of foreboding filled the air and a sight lay ahead of them that gave even Jack goosebumps. It was a house, looming tall in the night sky, with glowing windows that appeared to be alive as though they were the eyes of a monster. The three friends fearfully looked at each other, they knew the house was haunted."},{"prompt":"What is a good house cleaning schedule?

He also thinks he would be great as a duo with cheddar cheese or almond butter. Keep it under 400 words.","completion":"In a time not so long ago, in a vast and beautiful apple orchard, there was an apple named McIntosh. His friends called him Mac. Mac was a very special apple, not only because he was juicy, tart, plump, and sweet, but also because he had a grand plan to save the world. You see, McIntosh was convinced that the best way to keep the world healthy and happy was by keeping the doctor away. But how could he do that? By being the perfect fruit, of course! Everyone knows that an apple a day keeps the doctors away. McIntosh made it his mission in life to be the most nutritious and delicious apple in the entire orchard. That way anyone who ate him would be filled with energy, vitamins, and even joy. Mac loved the idea of making people happy, and what makes people happier than a healthy, warm, delicious apple pie? Apple pies bring people together and make them smile. He dreamed of being the star ingredient in every salad, snack, and dessert, his crisp skin contrasting perfectly bibb lettuce, edamame, or a buttery crust, and the scent of cinnamon and sugar filling the air. Of course, MacIntosh couldn't save the world all alone. He needed a partner, someone who would complement his flavor, texture, and nutrients. That's when he had an amazing idea: why not team up with a healthy partner like cheddar cheese or almond butter? Mac knew that cheddar cheese was the perfect match for his tartness, acidity, and crunchy texture and that together, they could create a hearty dish that would satisfy even the pickiest eaters. And as for almond butter, he imagined a creamy and nutty spread that would compliment his crunchiness, elevate his tart sweetness to a whole new level, and turn every snack into a healthy and scrumptious treat. Why choose only one sidekick? They could be a terrific trio! So, with his mission crystal clear, and his dream pie and snack already in the making, MacIntosh set out to save the world, one healthy, juicy bite at a time. Who knows, maybe someday, he will become the most beloved fruit in the world and everyone will eat him daily. This way, the apple that everyone loves and trusts, will heal the world, keep the doctor away, and be the hero that saves the day."},{"prompt":"Write a short comedic sketch using dialogue only about a group of apocalypse survivors who are terrified of zombies.

Some of these redwoods have fallen and petrified under my current, with its constant eroding flow, always south, always away from my cold origins. I am home for the fish and drink for the bear, deer, badger, and raccoon. They take little but men take much. Men tap into my southernmost streams and divert me to places where I don't belong. They take what I give freely and put a price on it to oppress the poor. What I would offer without money is exploited and sold at a greedy profit to the unsustainable desert-dwelling masses. The men say that water is not a human right. The men think that others are stupid to live in the desert and allow themselves to be sold water. If they will live where there is not enough water and then pay for it, why should we not take advantage of their stupidity? This is what the men think when they take me. I once was pure, like the most translucent crystal, untainted and undefiled. Now I choke on plastics, particles foreign to me, and chemicals never known in times past. Aluminum floats like fine dust all through my body. I poison the liver and kidneys in microdoses of toxicity daily. When will I be avenged for the stealing and desecration of my body?"},{"prompt":"What is the process of rain formation in terms of the Bergeron process","completion":"The Bergeron process, named after Swedish meteorologist Tor Bergeron, is a key method of rain formation in colder climates. This process primarily involves the growth and eventual fall of precipitation due to differences in saturation vapor pressure over supercooled water and ice. In a cloud where the temperature is below freezing, both supercooled water droplets and ice crystals can exist together. However, the saturation vapor pressure over ice is lower than that over supercooled water, meaning that water molecules in the air more readily condense or deposit onto the ice crystals. This results in the growth of ice crystals at the expense of supercooled water droplets, a process known as the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. As ice crystals grow larger, they become heavy enough to fall through the cloud. As these ice crystals descend, they may pass through warmer air and melt into raindrops. If the air below the cloud is not warm enough to melt the ice crystals, they may reach the ground as snow, sleet, or freezing rain."},{"prompt":"Give me yoga poses for shoulder blade and mid back pain. I sit all day at my desk at work and sometimes I slouch","completion":"Done! Here are 3 yoga poses for upper back and shoulder pain: 1: Cat Cow - Lay in a tabletop position, where the palms of your hands and knees are touching the mat. Arch your back slowly as you lift your chin up, imagining your spinal cord touching your belly button. Then gradually reverse the pose as you curl your chest in towards your knees. Alternate between the two poses for at least five cycles. This pose provides a deep stretch throughout the entire spine. 2: Thread the Needle - Return to tabletop position. Extend your right palm and place it at the top of your mat. Now reach your left palm face up through the right arm until the shoulder is touching the mat. Repeat with the opposite arm. This pose gives your shoulders and muscles more breathing room while opening your upper back. 3: Camel Pose - Sit up on your knees with your toes flexed.

These teeth are self-sharpening and can cleave a willow the size of a person's finger in a single bite! If the incisors become too long, they can prevent the beaver's mouth from closing enough for its grinding molars to meet, which could lead to starvation. Beavers regularly move between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Their small, dexterous front feet are well adapted to working on land. They walk on five digits, grasp sticks with their front paws and have well-developed digging claws. Their larger hind feet are webbed for swimming and void of fur, except on the dorsal surface. The hind feet also have a preening toe, the second from the inside, with a unique double toenail. Beavers are meticulous groomers. They use the preening toe as a comb to prevent their fine, soft fur from matting to maintain its waterproofing and insulating properties. These flexible toes also remove burrs and parasites.","completion":"- closing - digging - grinding - insulating - matting - preening - self-sharpening - swimming - waterproofing - working"},{"prompt":"I have no idea what an SSD is.","completion":"I can explain!

The presence of the Patriotic-insert-bots causes the Bad-bots to attack Sam and his girlfriend Mikaela Bads. More Patriotic-insert-bots arrive on Earth to find the McGuffinBox which is a source of limitless power that can create life and entire worlds which is ironic considering the lifeless sales pitch of this movie that will use 4th wall breaks to self-parody itself in an attempt to dodge any criticism. It turns out the McGuffinBox can only be created by fusing 19,000 sponsors. Advertisements flood the screen culminating in a battle between products and companies with some CGI video game assets thrown into the mix to make fans think there's something, anything at all, resembling the original show. Dimwitwitkee and Bads are captured by government spies after a full-scale ad and Bad-bot assault on a military base, the walls of which are covered in logos to create camouflage. They agree to help the government and then aren't tracked at all because that's absolutely what would happen and is totally believable. But it turns out they lied because the US wants to destroy the good Patriotic-insert-bots too, in a nonsensical moral shoehorned to make audiences forget that the real purpose of the film is to sell sponsorship segments. Sam and Mikaela go on a treasure hunt and find another random plot device that's amorphous and never shown yet somehow reveals to them the secret location of the McGuffinBox.

Please summarize in one sentence. Here is text to use: The death of a homeless man who allegedly had threatened passengers aboard a New York City subway and was put into a chokehold by one of the riders has been deemed a homicide, according to the medical examiner. Investigators had said they were waiting on the report to determine whether or not it was the chokehold that killed 30-year-old Jordan Neely at the Broadway-Lafayette station Monday afternoon. However, no charges have yet been filed against the 24-year-old passenger who put Neely in headlock. Some are now calling for justice for Neely, who was homeless and struggled with mental illness, and the the person who was initially hailed as a good Samaritan to be arrested.\\"What we're seeing is people deputizing themselves and not having a compassionate approach to mental health and homelessness,\\" said one of the speakers at a rally — held at the same station where the altercation occurred, and where EMS performed CPR on Neely after a witness said he was restrained for 15 minutes. The NYPD said it was called to the NoHo station around 2:25 p.m. after a report of a physical fight in a northbound F train. Witnesses and law enforcement sources said Neely got on the train and started acting very aggressively toward other riders, threatening to harm them. Police sources told NBC New York that Neely told riders on the train that he wanted food, that he wasn't taking no for an answer, and that he would hurt anyone on the train. \\"The man got on the subway car and began to say a somewhat aggressive speech, saying he was hungry, he was thirsty, that he didn't care about anything, he didn't care about going to jail, he didn't care that he gets a big life sentence,\\" said Juan Alberto Vazquez, who was in the subway car and recording part of what happened afterward. \\"That 'It doesn't even matter if I died.'\\"","completion":"Groups believe that the man who put Jordan Neely in a chokehold went without consequences due to a lack of empathy for the homeless and mentally ill."},{"prompt":"Create me a workout rap for teens/preteens.

Delta bluesman Big Joe Williams originally wrote and recorded the song in 1935, but it was the version by John Lee Hooker released in 1949 that convinced a 19-year-old Morrison to take on the song. Them’s then-guitarist Billy Harrison handles all of the distinctive lead parts while Page holds down the rhythm behind him. “Baby, Please Don’t Go” was released as a single on November 6th, 1964, but was ultimately completely overshadowed by the B-side, “Gloria” which of course became the biggest hit of Them’s short career.","completion":"“Baby, Please Don’t Go”“Baby, Please Don’t Go”“Don’t Start Crying Now”“Baby, Please Don’t Go”“Gloria”"},{"prompt":"I have come to have a greater appreciation for poetry over the years.

Plastic fruits and vegetables will work mixed in with real ones. Card tables and cardboard organizers can make up the display shelves. The leafy vegetable display should give an air of freshness.

Stroud went to the police station, and surrendered himself and the gun.[7] According to police reports, Stroud knocked von Dahmer unconscious and then shot him at point-blank range. Stroud's mother retained a lawyer, but he was found guilty of manslaughter on August 23, 1909, and sentenced to 12 years in the federal penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington, in Puget Sound.[8] As Alaska was then a United States territory without its own judiciary, Stroud's case was handled in the federal system.","completion":"Stroud had a difficult childhood, and his alcoholic father's abuse led to him running away from home at 13.

Musicians have the option to not only express themselves through their music and album art but now by using the vinyl itself, allowing them to make collectible and limited edition versions of their new albums and re-releases. Even though the colored vinyl record is nothing new, in the past, it was just seen as a novelty. Record owners at the time agreed that it sounded a lot worse than a typical black vinyl record and many fans of music stayed away from the fad, preferring audio quality over style. These days, however, colored vinyl has made a big comeback with many collectors admitting they haven't noticed a major difference in sound between traditional black and colored vinyl. Instead of using black carbon in colored vinyl records, these records are created using various dyes that are mixed with PVC as a part of the manufacturing process. It is a process that involves mixing different ingredients and can impact the sound. Experts have noticed that there are even some colors that will sound better than others. Many audiophiles claim that a translucent record that only has a hint of color will sound good; however, the same may argue that white records do not have a very clean sound. Some may say that pastel or opaque-colored records sound bad in comparison with black vinyl, which would make sense because that would involve mixing with at least two different colors. The logic follows that more colors equate to an increased impact on sound quality."},{"prompt":"Imagine you are a book blogger. Write a rejection email to an author who has requested a review.

Setting up a party can be daunting, but don't worry, I've got your back. 1. Determine the range of your budget: Staying within it is important because it makes planning everything else much easier. 2. Set a suitable date, time and venue: Keep the availability of people in your workplace in mind as you plan this. Hosting the party on a day when there would otherwise be a work day could be a good idea, but weekends may prove to be more suitable around the holiday season. The venue could either be at the workplace, a rented event space or even a hall. 3. Pick an engaging theme or decoration: Get your coworkers' opinions on themes they'd like to see at a party. Perhaps it's one based on Snow White, a fairytale or a popular T.V. show. 4. Catering: Whether you plan to have a buffet or even order pizza, make sure to have appropriate food and drink available for all persons; consider the restrictions or preferences for someone vegan, vegetarian, religious, non-alcoholic and so forth. 5. Entertainment: Whether it's putting the classic Christmas hits of the 1980s on the radio, or karaoke to a top chart hit, consider an activity that as many people will want to join in as possible. Other activities include board games, contests and trivia or hosted Q&As. 6. Photography: Consider this a great chance to capture pictures to serve as timeless memories. Pick somebody to be the designated photographer or set up a photo booth to capture all the silly, fun and endearing moments! 7. Organization: Make sure to anoint a few other people to help with planning and scheduling; doing everything on your own may be too daunting and remember that it's okay to enlist the help of others, that's what teams are for! 8. Invitations: Ensure all invitations are sent to the appropriate people ahead of time. Make sure to double-check emails when forwarding to multiple people or departments. When RSVPs are sent out earlier, recipients can more efficiently plan and prepare for the party's date. And most important of all, have fun! Use the party as a chance to capture important memories you'll remember for years to come and take the chance to express appreciation for the effort your coworkers have put into the environment over the year.

How many watts of power should your solar panels supply? 2. What is the minimum number of solar panels you should install? 3. What if the homeowner has additional electricity left over? Solar power is increasingly gaining popularity as a reliable and clean energy source for the home. Initially, you may find solar cells expensive, so you may use them in conjunction with your existing, grid-power electricity to meet your home's energy requirements. Once you install solar panels at your home, you can reduce the electrician's charges by connecting them to your house's electricity yourself. Install solar panels on your roof with the help of a professional or a do-it-yourself solar kit. You should try to supply the house with about 5000 watts of power per day. This means you will have to install at least 20 250-watt panels for minimum use in the home. This number is sufficient to run a water pump, refrigerator, and a few lights, which will help reduce your dependency on power-grid electricity. The greater the number of panels installed, the more energy efficient your house. With enough solar panels, you may be able to sell the additional electricity to a local electricity provider.","completion":"The answers are below: 1.

Severe drought hit the Midwest and southern Great Plains in 1930. Massive dust storms began in 1931. A series of drought years followed, further exacerbating the environmental disaster. By 1934, an estimated 35 million acres of formerly cultivated land had been rendered useless for farming, while another 125 million acres—an area roughly three-quarters the size of Texas—was rapidly losing its topsoil. Regular rainfall returned to the region by the end of 1939, bringing the Dust Bowl years to a close. The economic effects, however, persisted.

The journey started well, with Odin calmly navigating the balloon, Loki cracking jokes and making silly faces, and Thor pointing out all of the landmarks they were passing. However, soon things started to go awry as they crossed over the Atlantic Ocean. Loki, who had been snacking on spicy popcorn, suddenly got a case of indigestion and let out a series of explosive farts. Odin, being the responsible leader, tried to keep a straight face and ignore it, but Thor found it hilarious and began to laugh uncontrollably. The balloon bounced around crazily as Thor's laughter shook the basket. As they crossed over Africa, Loki's mischievous side started to take over. He threw a bucket of water on Odin, claiming it was a joke, but Odin did not find it funny. In retaliation, Odin began to tickle Loki mercilessly. Loki, being very ticklish, could not stop laughing and squirming, causing the basket to sway back and forth once more. As they approached Australia, Thor got a sudden craving for meatballs and began to whip up a batch in the tiny balloon basket. He used too many spices, and the flames of the ballon lit the meatballs on fire. The three friends began to frantically try to put out the fire with whatever they could grab, including a bucket of water and Loki's hat. By the time they reached Asia, the balloon was a disaster!

Give Your Students More Choices - Young kids don't get to make very many decisions about what they're doing, for how long and where. This is true both at home and at school. Sometimes it can be fun and exciting for them to have a say in what's going on. When kids can choose an activity, choose where they want to sit in the classroom or pick out a toy to play with, it helps to make their lessons more fun while allowing them to learn decision-making skills. 2. Incorporate Games with Learning - Games will always make learning more fun and they add instant engagement to any lesson plan. Whether you are reviewing answers for a test or going over memorization drills, games do not require a lot of preparation or expense. There are thousands of tutorials for free games you can play in the classroom online. 3. Get Moving - Most kids don't like to sit still in the classroom for long periods. Incorporating movement into the classroom can improve engagement dramatically. You can dedicate 10 to 15 minutes at least once or twice a day to short physical activities such as dancing or playing games that will encourage your students to get up and move around. 4. Incorporate Opportunities for Hands-On Learning - Teachers have relied on hands-on activities inside the classroom for many years and they have always helped improve the morale of their students. Hands-on (or active) learning will put students in control. Unlike traditional lecture-style lessons, these activities encourage students to produce original nights and ideas, which pushes them to deeper thought levels."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this story passage so it's only in first person It was just about holy Christmas time that the tree dreamed a dream. The tree had, doubtless, a kind of feeling that the festive time had arrived, and in his dream fancied he heard the bells ringing from all the churches round, and yet it seemed to him to be a beautiful summer’s day, mild and warm. His mighty summits was crowned with spreading fresh green foliage; the sunbeams played among the leaves and branches, and the air was full of fragrance from herb and blossom; painted butterflies chased each other; the summer flies danced around him, as if the world had been created merely for them to dance and be merry in. All that had happened to the tree during every year of his life seemed to pass before him, as in a festive procession. He saw the knights of olden times and noble ladies ride by through the wood on their gallant steeds, with plumes waving in their hats, and falcons on their wrists. The hunting horn sounded, and the dogs barked. He saw hostile warriors, in colored dresses and glittering armor, with spear and halberd, pitching their tents, and anon striking them. The watchfires again blazed, and men sang and slept under the hospitable shelter of the tree. He saw lovers meet in quiet happiness near him in the moonshine, and carve the initials of their names in the grayish-green bark on his trunk. Once, but long years had intervened since then, guitars and Eolian harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers; now they seemed to hang there again, and he could hear their marvellous tones. The wood-pigeons cooed as if to explain the feelings of the tree, and the cuckoo called out to tell him how many summer days he had yet to live. Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest branches. The tree felt itself stretching and spreading out, while through the root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life. As he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself. Already had his topmost branches pierced the clouds, which floated beneath them like troops of birds of passage, or large white swans; every leaf seemed gifted with sight, as if it possessed eyes to see. The stars became visible in broad daylight, large and sparkling, like clear and gentle eyes. They recalled to the memory the well-known look in the eyes of a child, or in the eyes of lovers who had once met beneath the branches of the old oak. These were wonderful and happy moments for the old tree, full of peace and joy; and yet, amidst all this happiness, the tree felt a yearning, longing desire that all the other trees, bushes, herbs, and flowers beneath him, might be able also to rise higher, as he had done, and to see all this splendor, and experience the same happiness.","completion":"It was during the sacred time of Christmas that I, the tree, had a dream.

It should be fairly detailed, but also fewer than 300 words.","completion":"Merino wool has become quite popular as a clothing material, especially among outdoor enthusiasts. Everything from base layers and socks to outerwear and hats seems to be made from this fabric currently. One of the biggest benefits of merino wool is its ability to help regulate body temperature no matter what the outside weather is like. Essentially, it can help keep a person cool in the summer heat as well as warm in the winter cold. This makes it good for outdoor use all year round. Another interesting advantage to merino wool is that it has antibacterial properties that eliminate odor. This means that if you sweat, or wear the garment multiple times, the smell won't be nearly as bad as it would be with other fabrics. In some cases, there may not be any noticeable smell at all! A third advantage to wearing clothing composed of merino wool is that it can absorb quite a bit of moisture, up to 30% of its weight before it begins to feel wet to your skin. So sweat, humidity in the air, or even drizzly rain won't feel as problematic when wearing merino wool. Merino wool is also naturally resistant to both wrinkles and static. This means that even if it has been tossed carelessly in a bag, or worn in dirty places, it will be likely to come out of the experience looking fresh, whereas other fabrics might not. Finally, because merino wool is a natural fabric, it decomposes quickly and efficiently which is great news for our planet. Unlike synthetic clothing which takes over twenty years to biodegrade, merino fabrics take only about six months. Overall, merino wool has many benefits to consider, and might just be one of the better fabrics to make clothing from."},{"prompt":"Make an internet argument saying that Portal 1 was a more important game than Portal 2. Discuss the game's relative impact.","completion":"So this might be a controversial take, but Portal 1 was just a better game than Portal 2. Yeah, I know what you might be asking. \\"But what about all the memes and all the jokes? What about Wheatley?\\" The truth is while Portal 2 was a bigger game that offered more, it isn't the game that captured the imagination of all those gamers who first played it in the Orange Box in 2007. People back then who bought the compilation for Half-Life or maybe Team Fortress 2 were surprised by one of the most unique and culturally resonant modern video games of all time. Simply put, Portal 2 is an iterative work. It builds upon foundational elements that Portal 1 introduced and should get credited for. Even if you enjoyed the puzzles more or found more of the dialogue in Portal 2 funny, the atmosphere, and lore were established by Portal 1. There could never have been a sequel to Portal without the original Portal. Portal 1 is the classic. Portal 2 is the expansion. Portal 1 is the must-play game.

When it came right down to it, in the divorce court, Ike Turner didn't even want Tina Turner to keep her name. Born as Anna Mae Bullock in Nutbush, Tenn., she was given her stage name by Ike early in their relationship. At the end, she was so eager to get away from him that she surrendered any claim to record royalties, publishing rights, and anything else, except \\"Tina Turner,\\" which she told the judge she had worked very hard for. \\"That name's got my daddy's blood written all over it,\\" Ike protested. But it would be more accurate to say it was written in Tina's own blood. \\"What's Love Got to Do With It\\" ranks as one of the most harrowing, uncompromising showbiz biographies I've ever seen. It is a tradition in the genre that performers must go through hard times in order to eventually arrive at fame, but few went through harder times than Tina Turner. The movie shows Ike, jealous of her talent and popularity, turning into a violent wife-beater, and it shows her putting up with a lot more than she should have, for a lot longer. The movie begins with a prologue in which little Anna Mae can sing louder than anyone else in the Nutbush church choir. A few years later, in St. Louis, she sees Ike Turner onstage and is intoxicated by his slick charm. Part of his act consists of inviting women from the audience to sing with his band. A few notes, and he shoos them away. But when Anna Mae Bullock got up on that stage, she came to stay. And soon, an innocent who hardly understands the world she is entering, she's on tour with Ike and his band. The movie stars Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne as Tina and Ike. They played the parents of the hero in \\"Boyz N the Hood,\\" but here they are in another universe -- Bassett fiery and convincing as Tina; Fishburne, in a powerful performance, able to show us both Ike's charm and his violent side. The singing on the movie's sound track is by Tina Turner, but Bassett's performances of the songs are so much in synch - not just lip-synch, but physically, and with personality and soul -- that it always seems as if we're watching Tina at work. As the two of them reach the heights of show business, with platinum records and big Vegas bookings and lots of money, their personal life turns into a nightmare. The movie shows Ike strung out on cocaine, flaunting his endless string of girlfriends, and subjecting Tina to verbal and physical abuse. A few friends advise her to walk away. Most of the people around them, intimidated by Ike or grateful for a generous drug supply, are enablers. The most harrowing scene in the movie comes one night as Ike beats Tina yet once again, and bleeding and battered she walks out of their hotel and down a highway and into a Ramada Inn, where she says, \\"My name is Tina Turner, and my husband and I have had an argument. I have 32 cents in my pocket. If you give me a room I promise you I will pay you back as soon as I can.\\" The manager gives her a room. The Ramada Inn roadside sign is prominent in the scene because, as Tina wrote in her autobiography, I, Tina, she will forever be grateful to the motel for taking her in. But what is amazing is that the scene isn't the end of Tina and Ike's relationship. The movie is unflinching in its willingness to show that Tina, like many battered wives, made excuses for her violent husband and believed his apologies and gave him more chances, long after she should have walked away. Finally she finds the strength to resist through Buddhist meditation techniques, and there is an unforgettable scene late in the film where she is about to open a big engagement and Ike slips past security and into her dressing room with a gun, and she finds the inner strength to face him down and not cave in, and go onstage like a professional. \\"What's Love Got to Do With It\\" has a lot of terrific music in it (including a closing glimpse of the real Tina Turner), but this is not the typical showbiz musical. It's a story of pain and courage, uncommonly honest and unflinching, and the next time I hear Tina Turner singing I will listen to the song in a whole new way.","completion":"As a young girl, Tina Turner, born Anna Mae Bullock, sings louder than anyone else in the Nutbush, Tenn., church choir.

What are the two signs of a slowdown in the economy? a) A decline in manufacturing output and an increase in retail sales. b) A decline in retail sales and an increase in manufacturing output. c) A decline in both retail sales and manufacturing output. d) An increase in both retail sales and manufacturing output. 2. Why is the decline in retail sales seen as ominous? a) It could lead to inflation. b) It could lead to an increase in borrowing costs. c) It could result in companies cutting back on employees. d) It could result in companies increasing production. 3. What is the reason for the inflation that has put household budgets under pressure? a) A decrease in consumer spending. b) An increase in production costs for goods and services. c) A decrease in production costs for goods and services. d) An increase in consumer savings. Shoppers are buying less and factories are making less—in other words, the economy is slowing down, and might even have entered a recession. Signs of a slowdown came on two fronts in reports Wednesday. Retail sales fell 1.1% in December, as consumers cut their spending in 10 out of the 13 major categories tracked by the Census Bureau.1 Businesses also hit the brakes, with U.S. manufacturing output falling 1.3% in December, the Federal Reserve said.2 Both were the second month of slowdowns in a row. The decline in retail sales is especially ominous because if consumers and businesses both continue cutting back, the economy could slow to the point that it enters a recession. When people curtail their spending, companies cut back on employees that make the good or service that isn’t selling. Economists have been predicting for months that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes could push the economy into a recession by making it too expensive to borrow money. If that does happen, the current job market where positions are plentiful—so far a bright spot for workers—could take a turn for the worse, economists said. Taken together, the day’s data “reinforces the message that recession is on its way and we could in fact already be in it.” said James Knightley, chief U.S. economist at ING, in a commentary. “Companies are going to increasingly adopt defensive strategies so the strong jobs numbers—pretty much the only decent set of numbers right now—cannot continue in this environment,” Inflation is partly responsible for the slowdown. Prices for products and services have rapidly increased since 2021, putting household budgets under pressure. Consumers have tapped into their savings and made purchases on credit cards to maintain their spending habits despite the price increases. But they may not be able to sustain this any longer. Not only that but household finances have been caught in the crossfire of the Federal Reserve’s war against that very inflation. The central bank has hiked its benchmark interest rate by 4.25 percentage points since March, a move that’s raised costs on consumer borrowing for things like credit cards and car loans.3 Note The federal funds rate heavily influences interest rates throughout the economy, including those on credit cards and car loans, but it’s not the rate you get on those loans. Banks typically charge a set amount above their so-called prime rate. The prime rate moves in tandem with the fed funds rate, but it’s typically about 3 percentage points higher. “American consumers are tightening their belts in the face of still-high inflation, rising credit costs, and shrinking wealth,” Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a commentary. Businesses are tightening their belts too, and have cut production across a broad range of items from cars to computers to clothes, according to the Fed’s data on industrial production—an indication that they are bracing for reduced demand for their goods. “It is evident that the manufacturing sector is already in recession,” economists at Wells Fargo Securities said in a commentary. The Fed’s interest rate hikes and subsequent slowing of the economy appear to have had the intended effect. Inflation has slowed significantly in recent months, according to data on consumer prices. Not only that, but the producer price index, which measures wholesale prices, fell 0.5%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said—and that could translate into lower prices on store shelves.","completion":"Answer: C. The two indicators of a slowdown in the economy are a decline in retail sales and manufacturing output. Answer: C. The decline in retail sales is considered ominous because it could result in companies cutting back on their employees. Answer: B. An increase in production costs for goods and services is the primary reason for inflation that has affected households' budgets."},{"prompt":"Can you explain to me how an internal combustion engine works and how have they improved over the years?","completion":"Internal combustion engines are found in all sorts of machines ranging from lawnmowers to large freighters that navigate the oceans. These engines run on a large variety of fuels which include the usual gas and diesel, but they can also run on fuels like natural gas, propane, biodiesel, or even ethanol. All these fuels have one thing in common, they are all combustible. The process of combustion, or burning, results in an energy release from a mixture of fuel and air. An internal combustion engine contains various components, but for simplicity's sake, let's focus on the fixed cylinder, pistons, crankshaft, powertrain, and ultimately the wheels. In an internal combustion engine, combustion happens within the engine by the ignition from a spark plug where that energy release is partially converted to do work. These expanding combustion gases will push the pistons which will then rotate the crankshaft, and, ultimately through a system of gears within the powertrain, will spin the wheels of the vehicle causing it to move. Since its creation, the internal combustion engine has been improved upon in several ways. For one, it has been integrated with hybrid electric powertrains to increase fuel economy by sharing the burden of moving the vehicle with the electric engine along with working side-by-side with plug-in hybrid electric systems where the electric motor will move the vehicle on its own up to certain speeds and distances to increase the range. Additionally, through years of R&D, manufacturers can reduce ICE emissions of certain pollutants like nitrogen oxide and particulate matter by more than 99%. Also, ICE performance has been drastically improved over the years in terms of overall horsepower and acceleration time along with using less fuel and increasing efficiency."},{"prompt":"Who is the most famous Magician of all time? And why?","completion":"The most famous magician on this list, Hungary-born Houdini was part magician and part entertainer, thrilling audiences all over the globe who traveled from far and wide to see him escape from impossible situations. He was most famous for his ability to escape from what seemed like anything and everything, including ropes, handcuffs, straight jackets, jail cells, water-filled milk cans, and even nailed-shut boxes that had been thrown into a river. It seemed like there was nothing Houdini could not escape from and nothing he could not make audiences believe. He was even able to make an elephant disappear! Houdini began to expose the tricks used by mediums. He gave lectures on the topic and often included demonstrations of these tricks during his performances. He joined a committee organized by Scientific American and analyzed claims for a 2,500 prize for true psychic phenomena (no one ever received the prize). He spoke in front of the U.S. House of Representatives, supporting a proposed bill that would ban telling fortunes for pay in Washington D.C. Even though Houdini brought about some skepticism, it seemed to create more interest in Spiritualism. The result being Spiritualists were extremely upset at Houdini and he received several death threats."},{"prompt":"I'm hungry.

Unlike the giant panda, red pandas prefer nibbling on bamboo leaves and fresh shoots as opposed to the stalks. A female red panda was once recorded as having eaten 20,000 bamboo leaves in one day! Red pandas need to eat so much bamboo because they can only digest about 24% of it. Though their diet is made up of mostly bamboo, red pandas sometimes also eat grass, fruit, eggs, insects and small animals. Interestingly, they are classified as carnivores (meat eaters), even though they mainly eat plants. Red pandas spend most of the day resting or sleeping. They are crepuscular, meaning they are most active in the early morning and late afternoon. When it’s cold, red pandas wrap themselves up in their bushy tail and go into a deep sleep called torpor. In torpor, their body temperature lowers and their respiration rate goes down.

Start by braiding three small strands at the crown of the head and gradually add more and more hair to each strand, securing the braid to the scalp along the way. You can also part your hair in the center and do this twice for French braided pigtails. - 4 stranded braid: It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of this style, but it’s nearly as easy as a standard braid with a more interesting look, plus it tends to be sturdier for those whose hair falls out of braids easily. - Half up: Take the top section of your hair and keep it up with a claw clip, a ponytail, or a small warrior’s knot; meanwhile let the bottom section of your hair hang loose. - Style with a headband or scarf: Leave your hair loose but brush it back so that there is no visible part. Then use your favorite headband or scarf. You can always use Bobby pins to hold slippery scarves in place. - Braided headband: Make a headband out of your own locks! This style is similar to a French braid except it’s woven from one temple To the other rather than straight back from the crown of the head. - Twisted halo: This style works best with curly or textured hair. Twist locks to weave them into a halo around your head, using Bobby pins to hold the twist in place. You can do this as a full updo or use just the top section of your hair for a half-down version. - Ponytail flip: Style your hair in a loose, low ponytail, then pull it into two symmetrical sections, creating a hole just above the elastic. Filter the long end of your ponytail through that hole once or twice to create a twist. This can also be done as a half-down style. - Space buns: part your hair into two even sections and secure both as high ponytails on each side of the head. Twist these into buns and hold them in place with pins. These can be tightly woven knots or loose for a wispier style."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this story about a tiny dog to make it first person like it is the dog telling the story.

It should go through the entire process.","completion":"It was 6 P.M. Karl was hanging out in his living room, thinking about what to make for dinner. He starts to head into the kitchen and takes a peek inside the fridge to see what he has. There were a lot of pizza ingredients from the pizza party that happened at work a couple of days ago. Karl also remembered that he had a pre-made pizza crust hanging out near the bread box. It looked like it was Karl's destiny to make pizza today. He gathers all the ingredients, places them on the counter, and gets to work. Karl prepares the pizza crust and places it on a steel pizza pan. He turns the oven to 375°F precisely. On the crust, he starts to brush it with a light layer of butter. It starts to glisten like the sea on a sunny day. Karl opens up a container with the pizza sauce they made at the pizza party. The deep red sauce with garlic and herb started to call to Karl as he pours and spreads it in a circle on the crust. Karl thought he should put the cheese on next, but he had another, better idea. He grabs his choice of meat, pepperoni, and sausage and starts to layer them on the sauce. He only dreamed of a pizza double layer with meat and cheese. The tiny squish that the pepperoni makes as they're placed on top of the sauce was almost heavenly. The sausage was the icing on the cake for Karl. Next was the cheese. He grabbed the shredded parmesan that was hanging out in the fridge and started to cover the pizza with the stuff. Extra cheese, no. Extra, EXTRA cheese. So much cheese that you'd think Karl owned a cow of his own. Lastly, Karl places the remaining pepperoni on top. He adds his choice of vegetables: mushrooms, and red onions on top of the pizza. It was complete. Karl's creation was complete. A double pepperoni, sausage with mushrooms and red onions, extra EXTRA cheese pizza. Just saying the name filled Karl's heart with all the fuzzy feelings in the world. The oven was primed at the perfect 375°F. Karl slowly places the pan on the top rack and closes the door. All he has to do is wait."},{"prompt":"Can you write a story about a man in a canoe trying to get away from society and enjoying a nice time out on the water.","completion":"Fred was on vacation. Finally, after years of toiling away in an office with no windows, he was able to find a weekend away on the lake all by himself and with no one to answer to. No bosses were breathing down his neck and nobody was blowing up his phone. This weekend it was just about a man and his boat. Exiting his lakeside cottage with a piece of toast in his mouth, a vintage tin lunch pail, and a thermos in his hand, he made his way down to the dock at the end of his property. It was a short walk but each step he took seemed to have a little bit of extra bounce to it. There, at the dock, he found his little red canoe. Careful to maintain his balance he stepped into the boat, untied it from the mooring, and pushed off into the foggy morning glow. It was nearly dead silent in the hours before dawn. The lake rippled with each paddle but nary a bird bothered him. Fred paddled around in a circuitous route staying close to the shore before venturing a bit farther out. The sun was starting to rise and he aimed his boat directly for it almost as if trying to catch Apollo's chariot before it breached the horizon. Of course, that wasn't a race Fred could win and he soon found himself a quarter mile from land and the sun shining its new rays on his face. He stopped paddling and just coasted for a few moments breathing in the air and feeling the warmth whisk away the last bit of fog clinging to the lake's surface. Closing his eyes, he retracted his paddle from the water and placed it beside him in the boat. Leaning back slightly he felt all the tension in his body releasing in one big wave. And at the end, an abrupt sound which ended up being his stomach rumbling. It wakened him from his reverie but not in a disruptive sort of way. No, it was like a comforting old friend giving you a pat on the back. And so Fred opened up his lunch pail and pulled out a breakfast sandwich. He poured himself a cup of piping hot joe from his thermos. And then he ate. All alone, and with a very big smile on his face."},{"prompt":"Tell me how to take care of my cultured pearl necklace in an article of 200-250 words. The tone should be casual yet knowledgeable. Include tips in these 3 categories: cleaning, storage, and maintenance.","completion":"1. Cleaning Pearls are more fragile than other gemstones. Cosmetics, perfume, and hairspray can dull a pearl’s luster, so don’t put on pearls before applying these products. After wearing your pearls, wipe them with a clean, soft cloth to remove body oil and perspiration. 2. Storage Pearls scratch easily, so they should be stored separately in a lined jewelry box or a soft pouch. Storing pearls for long periods in an airtight container can lead to dehydration, brittleness and cracking. This is why most jewelers recommend wearing pearls and exposing them to fresh air and natural humidity as often as possible. Just don’t wear them in a hot tub or swimming pool or while doing housework. Some common household chemicals and cleaning products can damage pearls, including chlorine and ammonia. 3. Maintenance A pearl necklace should be taken to a jeweler for restringing if signs of wear are detected. Be sure to ask the jeweler to knot the string between each pearl to keep the pearls from rubbing against each other. The knots will also help avoid losing pearls should the string break. If you have a pearl necklace with multiple strands, most jewelers will recommend restringing all strands at the same time regardless of wear."},{"prompt":"Who was Nellie Bly?","completion":"Nellie Bly was a journalist who was born in Cochran’s Mill, Pennsylvania on May 5, 1864.

They have been traveling for months and are finally nearing their destination. As they get closer, they can see that Pluto is a strange and beautiful world covered in ice and snow. Upon approach, they spot a large heart-shaped region on its surface. The astronauts land their spaceship and step out onto the surface of Pluto, the first to ever do so. As they explore, they come across something unexpected. They find a large, metallic object buried in the ice. The astronauts approach with trepidation. After some initial scans, they use their tools to dig up the object and are amazed by what they find. The object is a spaceship, made of a strange, unknown material, and it is powered by a source of energy that the astronauts do not understand. The astronauts decide to take the spaceship back to Earth for further study. As they travel back to Earth, they can't help but wonder who built this spaceship and why they left it on Pluto. They also wonder if there are other spaceships out there, waiting to be discovered.

Public transit systems face daunting challenges across the U.S., from pandemic ridership losses to traffic congestion, fare evasion and pressure to keep rides affordable. In some cities, including Boston, Kansas City and Washington, many elected officials and advocates see fare-free public transit as the solution. Federal COVID-19 relief funds, which have subsidized transit operations across the nation at an unprecedented level since 2020, offered a natural experiment in free-fare transit. Advocates applauded these changes and are now pushing to make fare-free bus lines permanent. But although these experiments aided low-income families and modestly boosted ridership, they also created new political and economic challenges for beleaguered transit agencies. With ridership still dramatically below pre-pandemic levels and temporary federal support expiring, transportation agencies face an economic and managerial “doom spiral.” Free public transit that doesn’t bankrupt agencies would require a revolution in transit funding. In most regions, U.S. voters – 85% of whom commute by automobile – have resisted deep subsidies and expect fare collection to cover a portion of operating budgets. Studies also show that transit riders are likely to prefer better, low-cost service to free rides on the substandard options that exist in much of the U.S. Why isn’t transit free? As I recount in my new book, “The Great American Transit Disaster,” mass transit in the U.S. was an unsubsidized, privately operated service for decades prior to the 1960s and 1970s. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, prosperous city dwellers used public transit to escape from overcrowded urban neighborhoods to more spacious “streetcar suburbs.” Commuting symbolized success for families with the income to pay the daily fare. These systems were self-financing: Transit company investors made their money in suburban real estate when rail lines opened up. They charged low fares to entice riders looking to buy land and homes. The most famous example was the Pacific Electric “red car” transit system in Los Angeles that Henry Huntingdon built to transform his vast landholdings into profitable subdivisions. However, once streetcar suburbs were built out, these companies had no further incentive to provide excellent transit. Unhappy voters felt suckered into crummy commutes. In response, city officials retaliated against the powerful transit interests by taxing them heavily and charging them for street repairs. Meanwhile, the introduction of mass-produced personal cars created new competition for public transit. As autos gained popularity in the 1920s and 1930s, frustrated commuters swapped out riding for driving, and private transit companies like Pacific Electric began failing. Grudging public takeovers In most cities, politicians refused to prop up the often-hated private transit companies that now were begging for tax concessions, fare increases or public buyouts. In 1959, for instance, politicians still forced Baltimore’s fading private transit company, the BTC, to divert US2.6 million in revenues annually to taxes. The companies retaliated by slashing maintenance, routes and service. Local and state governments finally stepped in to save the ruins of the hardest-strapped companies in the 1960s and 1970s. Public buyouts took place only after decades of devastating losses, including most streetcar networks, in cities such as Baltimore (1970), Atlanta (1971) and Houston (1974). These poorly subsidized public systems continued to lose riders. Transit’s share of daily commuters fell from 8.5% in 1970 to 4.9% in 2018. And while low-income people disproportionately ride transit, a 2008 study showed that roughly 80% of the working poor commuted by vehicle instead, despite the high cost of car ownership. There were exceptions. Notably, San Francisco and Boston began subsidizing transit in 1904 and 1918, respectively, by sharing tax revenues with newly created public operators. Even in the face of significant ridership losses from 1945 to 1970, these cities’ transit systems kept fares low, maintained legacy rail and bus lines and modestly renovated their systems. Converging pressures Today, public transit is under enormous pressure nationwide. Inflation and driver shortages are driving up operating costs. Managers are spending more money on public safety in response to rising transit crime rates and unhoused people using buses and trains for shelter. Many systems are also contending with decrepit infrastructure. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives U.S. public transit systems a grade of D-minus and estimates their national backlog of unmet capital needs at 176 billion. Deferred repairs and upgrades reduce service quality, leading to events like a 30-day emergency shutdown of an entire subway line in Boston in 2022. Despite flashing warning signs, political support for public transit remains weak, especially among conservatives. So it’s not clear that relying on government to make up for free fares is sustainable or a priority. For example, in Washington, conflict is brewing within the city government over how to fund a free bus initiative. Kansas City, the largest U.S. system to adopt fare-free transit, faces a new challenge: finding funding to expand its small network, which just 3% of its residents use. A better model Other cities are using more targeted strategies to make public transit accessible to everyone. For example, “Fair fare” programs in San Francisco, New York and Boston offer discounts based on income, while still collecting full fares from those who can afford to pay. Income-based discounts like these reduce the political liability of giving free rides to everyone, including affluent transit users. Some providers have initiated or are considering fare integration policies. In this approach, transfers between different types of transit and systems are free; riders pay one time. For example, in Chicago, rapid transit or bus riders can transfer at no charge to a suburban bus to finish their trips, and vice versa. Fare integration is less costly than fare-free systems, and lower-income riders stand to benefit. Enabling riders to pay for all types of trips with a single smart card further streamlines their journeys. As ridership grows under Fair Fares and fare integration, I expect that additional revenue will help build better service, attracting more riders. Increasing ridership while supporting agency budgets will help make the political case for deeper public investments in service and equipment. A virtuous circle could develop. History shows what works best to rebuild public transit networks, and free transit isn’t high on the list. Cities like Boston, San Francisco and New York have more transit because voters and politicians have supplemented fare collection with a combination of property taxes, bridge tolls, sales taxes and more. Taking fares out of the formula spreads the red ink even faster.","completion":"These cities' politicians and voters have funded more transit options by supplementing fare collections with other sources of public income like bridge tolls and sales and property taxes."},{"prompt":"Create an itinerary for my 4-day trip to Greece, including nice spots and activities.

Many of you who had come into contact with Craig will undoubtedly have fond memories and funny stories about him, as do I, which I'm sure we'll get a chance to share at the wake later tonight. One thing that I will say about Craig is, despite the untimely accident, he was very fond of dressing up his pet monkey, \\"Peaches\\", in a variety of clothing from the 1980s. He loved playing dress-up with Peaches and serving her tea and biscuits at noon; he loved that monkey like a daughter. It's unfortunate what happened that fateful day a month ago. Craig would never have put that pink tutu on Peaches if he knew Peaches would reject it so violently. I think even if Craig did know how Peaches would respond, he wouldn't take it personally, for he loved that simian so much. But that's all in the past now. I like to think that Craig is in a better place, one where he can have a sip of his margarita and sit on the heavenly beaches. I think Craig would probably be saving a space for the rest of us until we join him, and even a seat on his beach blanket for Peaches by his side. Now, let us all bow our heads in prayer for Craig, so that he may hear us wishing him well on his journey to the afterlife.

Indeed, just about everything in the universe is constantly moving. Calculus helped to determine how particles, stars, and matter actually move and change in real time. Calculus is used in a multitude of fields that you wouldn't ordinarily think would make use of its concepts. Among them are physics, engineering, economics, statistics, and medicine. Calculus is also used in such disparate areas as space travel, as well as determining how medications interact with the body, and even how to build safer structures. You'll understand why calculus is useful in so many areas if you know a bit about its history as well as what it is designed to do and measure. Calculus was developed in the latter half of the 17th century by two mathematicians, Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton. Newton first developed calculus and applied it directly to the understanding of physical systems. Independently, Leibniz developed the notations used in calculus. Put simply, while basic math uses operations such as plus, minus, times, and division (+, -, x, and ÷), calculus uses operations that employ functions and integrals to calculate rates of change. Those tools allowed Newton, Leibniz, and other mathematicians who followed to calculate things like the exact slope of a curve at any point. The Story of Mathematics explains the importance of Newton's fundamental theorem of the calculus: \\"Unlike the static geometry of the Greeks, calculus allowed mathematicians and engineers to make sense of the motion and dynamic change in the changing world around us, such as the orbits of planets, the motion of fluids, etc.\\" Using calculus, scientists, astronomers, physicists, mathematicians, and chemists could now chart the orbit of the planets and stars, as well as the path of electrons and protons at the atomic level.","completion":"Course Title: An Introduction to Calculus: Exploring Dynamic Change in the Universe Course Description: Calculus, a branch of mathematics, revolutionized the way we understand and analyze dynamic systems in the universe.

Use the article below: The notion of a \\"war on terror\\" was contentious, with critics charging that it has been used to reduce civil liberties and infringe upon human rights,[49] such as controversial actions by the U.S. including surveillance, torture, and extraordinary rendition, and drone strikes that resulted in the deaths of alleged terrorists but also civilians.[50][51][52] Many of the U.S.' actions were supported by other countries, including the 54 countries that were involved with CIA black sites,[53] or those that assisted with drone strikes.[54] Criticism of the war on terror has focused on its morality, efficiency, and cost. According to a 2021 study conducted by the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, the several post-9/11 wars participated in by the United States in its war against terror have caused the displacement, conservatively calculated, of 38 million people in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Philippines and Pakistan; 11.3 million remain displaced.[55] The study estimated these wars caused the deaths of 897,000 to 929,000 people, including over 364,000 civilians, and cost 8 trillion.[56][57] Critics accuse participating governments of using the \\"war on terror\\" to repress minorities or sideline domestic opponents,[58][59] of mainstreaming Islamophobia,[60] and have criticized negative impacts to health and the environment resulting from it.[61][62][63] Critics assert that the term \\"war\\" is not appropriate in this context (much like the term \\"war on drugs\\") since terror is not an identifiable enemy and it is unlikely that international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.[64]","completion":"While many countries, including those that assisted with drone strikes or were involved in drone strikes, supported US action, some critics have alleged that the notion has been used to reduce civil liberties and infringe upon human rights.

Why these fish mothers cannibalise their babies Some African cichlid fish raise their young in their mouths—and snack on them. Now, scientists may have figured out the reason. Raising babies can be exhausting—so much so that some mouthbrooding mothers snack on their young, according to a new study. A central African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni—commonly called Burton’s mouthbrooder—sometimes consumes more than three-quarters of their own eggs and baby fish. “It is a surprise,” says Peter Dijkstra, a biologist at Central Michigan University and senior author of a study published today in Biology Letters. “It really is a lot.” Mouthbrooding is common among fish, particularly cichlids, colourful freshwater species that are popular as aquarium pets. After their eggs are fertilised, A. burtoni mothers will shelter them in their mouths for roughly two weeks to protect them from predators. (Read about other long-haul animal mothers.) After the eggs hatch into tiny larval fish, the babies venture outside their mother’s mouth, but scurry back in when there’s danger. It’s a great start for the young fish, but it’s extremely tiring for the mother cichlid, who can’t breathe properly or eat during that period. The new study shows, however, that the suffering moms can counter that by consuming some of their young, a behaviour called “filial cannibalism.”","completion":"A biologist called Peter Dijkstra has done a study into a colourful fish called the African cichlid fish. This fish lives in Central Africa, but some people have it in their aquariums. The African cichlid fish keeps their babies in their mouths after they are born. The mother's mouth is like a bird's nest or a fox's den. After the eggs hatch into tiny baby fish, the baby fish are vulnerable and they need a safe place to live, so they don't get attacked by predators. The babies live in their mum's mouths for two weeks. This is called mouthbrooding. The baby fish swim outside their mother’s mouth, but if there is any danger they go back in and hide. It is a great start for the baby fish. However, it is not good for the mothers. It makes the mother fish very tired. In fact, they can't breathe well with the babies in their mouths. They can't eat because their mouth is full of their babies and eggs. This is why they sometimes eat some of their eggs and babies. They sometimes eat more than three-quarters of their own eggs and baby fish. Scientists are very surprised about this."},{"prompt":"How does forex trading work?","completion":"Forex trading involves trading currencies with the intention of making money from changes in exchange rates."},{"prompt":"In which year did forex trading start?","completion":"Forex trading began in 1972 at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange."},{"prompt":"Does Forex trading involve Bitcoin?","completion":"Yes, Bitcoin may be used in forex.

Which fact is correct and why? For All Mankind is an American science-fiction drama television series created by Ronald D. Moore, Matt Wolpert, and Ben Nedivi and produced for Apple TV+. The series dramatizes an alternate history depicting \\"what would have happened if the global space race had never ended\\" after the Soviet Union succeeds in the first crewed Moon landing ahead of the United States.[1] The title is inspired by the lunar plaque left on the moon by the crew of Apollo 11, which reads in part, \\"We Came in Peace for All Mankind\\".[2] In an alternate timeline in 1969, Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov becomes the first human to land on the Moon. This outcome devastates morale at NASA, but also catalyzes a U.S. effort to catch up. With the Soviet Union emphasizing diversity by including a woman in subsequent landings, the United States is forced to match pace, training women and minorities who were largely excluded from the initial decades of U.S. space exploration. Each subsequent season takes place 10 years later, with season two taking place in the 1980s, season three taking place in the 1990s, (and as revealed in the season-three finale) season four taking place in the 2000s. Ronald D. Moore explained how history had been different in the series: \\"Sergei Korolev was the father of the Soviet space program; in our reality, he died during an operation in Moscow (in 1965) ... And after that point, their Moon program really never pulled together....

I clenched my jaw and gripped the gear shift, ready to chase him down. Taking a deep breath, I relaxed my muscles, collected my thoughts, and parked the car. I replayed those words in my head, my blood boiling up to my ears, and I kept coming back to the same question: I’ve been on the receiving end of much worse before, why am I so furious? I then realized who those words were from. That driver was a fellow American, someone who I could have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with at a World Cup game cheering for the same country. This thought infuriated me and made me question the depth of the American spirit in the United States. Back in my apartment, I tried to come to terms with the fact that people from all walks of life, even Americans, can discriminate. It took much self-restraint for me not to start that car chase and I was proud of myself for showing restraint. As someone who wasn’t always good at remaining calm, I have grown tremendously in controlling my temper over the past few years. Before that day, the concept of the American spirit was still largely a hazy idea for me. I vaguely believed Americans should focus on helping themselves before helping others when they are in need, even if that need is intangible like cultural acceptance. However, my encounter with that driver helped develop my belief about the American spirit: the American spirit is the continuous never-ending cycle of self-improvement and helping others. These two ideas of simultaneous self-improvement and helping others are both necessary in building a grounded foundation and it is up to each true American to find his or her style. Sometimes it is not so straightforward, and almost always, it is not easy. On that day, I focused on composure and having a mature response. This in turn stopped me from compounding the driver’s hate with my hate and that was about as much help as I could give him. In reality, anybody can simply be an American by legal definition, but fully embodying the American spirit is much more meaningful. This realization continues to grow my appreciation and admiration for those with true American spirit."},{"prompt":"Write a poem about how life is so hard sometimes.

One side can represent positive feelings, the other negative. Every time you flip a coin somewhere, something changes in the world. Can you imagine if the world worked out like that? Flip once, get heads. An unknown man gets his big break and starts his dream job. Flip twice, get tails. The earthquake happening in a country you don't even know about gets stronger and stronger.

What if I told you that you have the power to make that coin land on whatever side you want? Think about the choices. You won't gain a benefit or a demerit from this choice. So what does it matter, right? Are you a good deeds kind of person? One that believes that karma exists in the world? Or maybe you like a little chaos in your life.

Here's the source text: IM-2 may be delayed because of the wait for IM-1, Altemus said during the phone call, the first since Intuitive Machines was listed publicly in February. For now, IM-3 is expected to launch in 2024. Intuitive Machines reported an operating loss of 14 million in the most recent quarter, compared with 4.5 million in the same quarter of 2022; a portion of the loss, 2.8 million, was due to the costs associated with the merger that took it public. Quarterly revenue was similar to last year, with 18.2 million reported in 2023 and 18.5 million in 2022, SpaceNews reported. Another U.S. company supported by NASA, Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic, is also attempting to be the first to ace a private touchdown on the moon.

Proper Axolotl Aquarium Size Since axolotls are bottom-feeding animals, the height of their aquarium is not as important as the length and width of it. Reaching an adult size of up to 10 inches in length or more, your axolotl needs plenty of room to turn around and fully extend its body in any direction. If an axolotl’s habitat is too small, it can cause stress for the animal, which can lead to health problems in the long term. To accommodate the lifelong growth of your pet, we recommend nothing smaller than a 30 or 40-Gallon Breeder tank, along with a lid to prevent the axolotl from jumping out of its enclosure (it’s happened before!). This is a common aquarium size and they are readily available at most pet stores and fish shops. Axolotl Aquarium Filtration Axolotls evolved in the relatively still waters of Lake Xochimilco in the valley of Mexico. Therefore, you should avoid using filters and equipment that produce a high amount of water flow and surface agitation in your axolotl’s aquarium. At the same time, axolotls also produce a significant amount of waste which can quickly pollute their water if there is inadequate filtration in the tank. Canister filters, hang-on-back filters, and internal filters with adjustable flow rates are all ideal—providing three types of filtration (mechanical, biological, and chemical) to help your axolotl thrive. Another benefit of these three types of filters is that they allow you to aim the filtered water towards the surface of the tank. This helps prevent a buildup of debris and small particles from accumulating and creating a glossy film on the surface of the water. A less expensive option, while not as effective, is a sponge filter. Although they lack chemical filtration, they still provide adequate mechanical and biological filtration as long as they are large enough to accommodate the filtration load of the aquarium and its resident(s). Sponge filters will collect debris, waste, and other free-floating particles while simultaneously supplying plenty of surface area for beneficial bacteria to develop. Filters do not eliminate the need for regular maintenance. All aquariums require routine maintenance to keep them running at their optimal performance, and to keep the animals living there happy and healthy. Practicing a regular water change routine and performing regular water tests is essential to make sure your axolotl’s environment is as comfortable and healthy as possible. There are many filter options available on the market. Here are some we recommend based on our many years of experience keeping aquatic animals:","completion":"Proper Axolotl Aquarium Size 1. Select an aquarium your Axolotl can grow and be comfortable in. Axolotls are bottom feeders and can grow up to 10 inches. They will need to be able to turn and extend its body in any direction. 2. Make sure it's not smaller than a 30 or 40-gallon breeder tank and don't forget the lid. An axolotl can jump out of its enclosure. 3. Choose a filter without a high amount of water flow or surface agitation in your axolotl's aquarium. Axolotls come from Lake Xochimilco, which has relatively still waters, so you want to recreate this environment. 4. Choose an adequate filter for the high waste amount of an axolotl. Canister filters, hang-on-back filters, and internal filters with adjustable flow rates are ideal and will help your axolotl thrive. 5. Consider a sponge filter. These are not as effective but are less expensive. They can provide adequate mechanical and biological filtration as long as they are large enough to accommodate the filtration load of the aquarium and its residents. 6. Complete routine maintenance. All aquariums need routine maintenance to keep them running and keep their inhabitance safe and healthy.

Bob was a very grumpy bear because he never liked to share anything. He would always keep his honey, his fish, and his berries to himself. This made him very lonely, as none of the other animals in the forest wanted to be friends with him. One sunny day, while Bob was out looking for honey, he stumbled upon a family of rabbits. The rabbits were very friendly and invited Bob to join them for lunch. Bob was hesitant at first, but he was also very hungry, so he agreed. The rabbits brought out a big basket of carrots, lettuce, and other vegetables. Bob had never tasted anything like it before. He was so hungry that he ate everything in the basket. The rabbits didn't seem to mind, and they even offered him more. Bob was amazed at how kind the rabbits were. He had never felt so happy before. After that day, Bob started to think about sharing more often. He realized that it was not only kind, but it also made him feel good inside. He started to share his honey with the bees and his berries with the birds. Slowly but surely, the other animals in the forest started to notice how much kinder Bob had become. They started to befriend him and invite him to their gatherings. Bob was no longer a grumpy bear, but a happy and friendly one. And all the animals in the forest loved him for it. One day, while Bob was out foraging for food, he came across a group of animals who needed help. They had lost their home in a nearby fire and were struggling to find food and shelter. Bob remembered how lonely he had felt before he learned to share and knew that he couldn't let these animals suffer. He offered to share his food and even helped them build a new home. The animals were very grateful, and Bob felt happy knowing that he could make a difference. From that day on, Bob became known as the kindest bear in the forest."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this passage with quotes in quotation marks and proper punctuation.

To see the construction companies at bay. At the empty lot across the street for me. They were building something, a new house maybe. Sure enough, as time went on by. The walls and floors built up really high. As quickly as the old house had burnt down, They were building a new one all around. The noises were annoying and loud! The grinding, the sawing, and the nailing abound. I already didn't like the new neighbors here, And the house was not yet for sale anywhere! After six months of that annoying din, A new little family finally moved in. A mother, a father, and a small little son. They were all dressed in gray, where was the fun? I scoffed and I sighed as I watched them go. A tiny glimpse into their life through my window. The wife never seemed to leave her abode, But the husband brought his grill, in the truck he always towed. I never saw the son, an annoying thought. They never let him play with the outdoor toys they bought. Why keep the child locked up all inside? What did these people have to hide? I look out and watch these annoying new people.

Also, it shows the costs and benefits that are related to the earning of that revenue. At the bottom of the statement or the “bottom line,” the report will show whether a firm had net earnings or net losses over the time the statement is reporting for. Lastly, the income statement reports earnings per share (EPS) which tells the reader the amount shareholders would receive if the firm decided to distribute all its net earnings for a specific time. The balance sheet gives the reader details on the firm’s assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity. These three variables make up the basic accounting equation where assets equal liabilities plus stockholder’s equity. Assets are anything that a firm owns that has value. This means assets can be either sold or used so the firm can provide products or services resulting from the use of said assets. Liabilities represent certain amounts of money that a company may owe to others. A firm can have liabilities that are due within the year (short-term) or liabilities that are due over a year (long-term). These can include various obligations like bank loans, accounts payable, or even rent. Stockholder’s equity represents the amount of money that would be remaining if a firm sold all its owned assets and paid off all its liabilities where what is left over would belong to the shareholders. The statement of cash flows gives the reader a company’s inflows and outflows of cash. This report is important due to being able to show if a company has enough cash on hand to pay off its expenses and purchase further assets. This report shows the changes over time rather than the absolute dollar amounts at a specific point in time. Usually, the statement of cash flows is divided into three parts which include operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities."},{"prompt":"I'm looking for a good book to read.

I gripped the control yokes, my flight gloves flexing with familiar resistance. I was ready for this. I felt it in my bones. According to the briefing, we would be deployed the moment our Star Destroyer dropped out of hyperspace. It was always a jolt to drop from the TIE launch tram. The thing was an engineering masterpiece, but it still hit the pit of your stomach like a prize fighter. With open space in front of me, though, I was truly in my element. No matter what ship those rebel scum wrapped themselves in, they could never escape the cleansing effect of laser fire. I was eager to show them. Within seconds of our arrival in the system, my squadron was ordered to disable or destroy the Pelta-Class frigate in orbit around this unimportant planetoid. As one of the largest ships in the system, there was little doubt of its importance. I dove in, spinning around the pathetic defensive fire from a BTL Y-Wing along the way. On my display, I saw that my wingman did the same, barely faltering from our course toward the target. That simple pair of Y-Wings probably constituted the Rebel Alliance’s entire standing defensive screen. Given how quickly we’d appeared on their doorstep, they had almost zero chance of mustering more fighters before we reached our objectives. I zipped around behind the Pelta, firing my laser jabs at the aft shield motivators. Their destruction wouldn’t kill the shields outright, but it would limit their power across the aft end of the ship. That would make the rest of my squadron’s attacks on the engines far more effective. My wingman and I would now provide covering fire while the remainder of our squadron dug into the ship’s engine section. And even given my TIE’s limited visibility, I noticed the flashes from exploding engine chambers. That brought a smile to my face. A flurry of radio calls confirmed our success. All that remained for my wingman and I now was to clear a path back to the Star Destroyer.

The first references to the use of plant oils can be traced to Chinese medicine, also known as Traditional Chinese Medicine. Various parts of plants were consumed in either the raw state or dried, boiled, or steamed (to extract the oil). The end product was then consumed, inserted into any one of the natural openings of the body, massaged into the skin, or inhaled in vapor form. During the Medieval period, a collection of medicinal treatments for a variety of ailments was published by Abu Ali al-Husain Ebn Abdullah Ebn Sina (980–1037 AD). He was known in the West as Avicenna, a Persian physician who was also known as one of the most influential medical writers in the medieval period. Avicenna\`s Canon of Medicine, arguably one of the most famous books in the history of medicine, presents a clear and organized summary of all of the medical knowledge of the time, including a long list of drugs. Interestingly, lily and spotted orchid oils are mentioned as remedies for tinnitus (Mahdizadeh et al, 2015). Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, advances in western medicine progressed. The American Medical Association was founded in 1847 and the American Pharmaceutical Association was founded in 1852. At the federal level, the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration (FDIA) was created 1927 and, three years later, changed its name to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).","completion":"Plant oils have been used for a long time.

Get out for a quick loosening of muscles before the eventual plod of pedestrian feet on cement; The gusts of mountain wind blow heavily down the natural corridor on the path ahead. One foot in front of the other, pace starts slow and comfortable; Legs begin the process of invigorating the body with blood. Pushing upward on the wind-blown path, barely hearing the traffic rushing by; Headlights begin to flicker on, illuminating the adjacent asphalt. The grey cement sidewalk is this traveler's lane, and he intends to stick to it; He knows the first half-mile is the tough part, and the second half, the reward for perseverance. The post office's flagpole delineates the halfway mark as the runner's course begins its downward slope; The wind pushes at his back, he leans back slightly on an airy recliner. \\"It must be 6 pm,\\" he thought to himself, as his eyes captured the image of the sun; A glowing orange orb descending slowly but surely to the horizon. Up and down the circular path the runner continued his evening ritual; A ritual playing scenes of both pain and pleasure, like a zoetrope of agony and ecstasy. \\"Heaven,\\" he muttered on one of his exhales, his breathing now at a labored pace; Twenty laps, yea, twenty miles, but the natural beauty of this place only grows. The sun finally sets on the man's journey, and darkness gives way to illuminating street lamps; The runner stops for the day, And goes to sleep that night contented."},{"prompt":"I have this image of an irate squirrel persistently attacking a nut and trying to open it, but to no avail.

There are many side hustles you can do both in person and virtually if you'd like to earn extra money or develop a passive income. Here are some ideas for things you could do on the side to make money while still working a traditional day job: 1. Edit Videos. Oftentimes brands need to produce promotional materials but don't necessarily have the time or expertise to do it in-house, so they hire freelancers to edit video content. 2. Sell NFTs. Non-fungible tokens are used to buy and sell products online. If you have something creative to sell, NFTs can be a great way to turn a steady profit. 3. Be a social media manager. Many companies or small businesses need a social media presence but don't necessarily want to deal with posting and coming up with good content all of the time. This is why many businesses will hire someone else to do this for them. 4. Be a virtual assistant. This is a straightforward side hustle that can be done from anywhere. 5. House sit. Housesitting is an industry in itself where people that have second homes or go on vacation but want someone to look after their space, including pets and plants, hire other people to do so. 6. Teach a language. You don't necessarily have to be bilingual to teach your native language to others, and this can be done virtually or in person. 7. Rent out your space. Airbnb has made it super simple and profitable to rent out your spare room or your entire home if you aren't using it. 8. Sell products on Etsy. These can be physical products or digital designs like branding or spreadsheets, for example. 9. Drive for a rideshare company. If you have a car, driving for Uber or Lyft in your downtime or on the weekends is a great way to earn money on the side. 10. Deliver food. Depending on where you live, delivering food through Postmates or Deliveroo can be a substantial side hustle and you don't even need a car. 11. Write an e-book. Since it's possible to self-publish, there's no downside to creating an e-book on a topic you're familiar with and selling it on Amazon. 12. Create an online course. This is another thing that may require a good amount of work upfront, but can eventually turn into a passive income."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this list of Do's and Don'ts into a paragraph. Here are some do’s and don’ts about making your baby’s sleep space safe: Do put your baby to sleep on his back on a flat, firm surface, like a crib mattress covered with a tightly fitted sheet. Use only the mattress made for your baby’s crib. The mattress should fit snugly in the crib so there are no spaces between the mattress and the crib frame. The mattress shape should stay firm even when covered with a tightly fitted sheet or mattress cover. Do put your baby to bed in his own crib or bassinet. Don’t bed-share. This is when babies and parents sleep together in the same bed. Bed-sharing is the most common cause of death in babies younger than 3 months old. Keep your baby’s crib close to your bed so your baby’s nearby during the night. The American Academy of Pediatrics (also called AAP) recommends that you and your baby sleep in the same room, but not in the same bed, for the first year of your baby’s life but at least for the first 6 months Do make sure your baby’s bassinet, crib or play yard meets current safety standards. Visit the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to learn more about product safety standards or product recalls. Do remove hanging window cords or electrical wires near where your baby sleeps. Babies can get tangled in them and choke. Do keep the room at a comfortable temperature. If your baby is sweating or his chest feels hot, he may be overheated. Don’t use sleep positioners. These sometimes are called nests or anti-roll pillows. They often are mats or wedges with pillows on either side to help keep your baby in place. The Food and Drug Administration (also called FDA) warns that sleep positioners can cause babies to die because of suffocation. Don’t let your baby sleep in a carrier, sling, car seat or stroller. Babies who sleep in these items can suffocate. If your baby falls asleep in one, take her out and put her in her crib as soon as you can. Don’t put your baby to sleep on soft surfaces, like a waterbed, sofa, soft mattress or cushion. Don’t keep crib bumpers, loose bedding, toys or other soft objects in your baby’s crib. They put your baby in danger of being trapped, strangled or suffocated. Don’t use cribs with drop-side rails. Don’t put portable bed rails on a regular bed. Babies can get stuck in rails and choke. Don’t try to fix a crib that has broken or missing parts.","completion":"Safe sleep is important to keep babies safe and alive. Babies should be put to sleep on their backs, on a flat, firm surface.

Include some ways that the two professions are different and a few ways they are the same. Discuss the requirements for becoming a CPA in Florida.","completion":"What is the difference between a CPA and an accountant in Florida? This is a question that many business owners ask. While many of the duties are the same for a CPA and an accountant, there are some very distinct differences. A CPA or Certified Public Accountant can perform all the duties of an accountant but the reverse is not true. The requirements to become a CPA vary from state to state. Becoming a CPA in Florida requires 120 semester hours of undergraduate education including accounting courses and business courses. A candidate must also pass the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination and get a specific number of hours of on-the-job training. While an accountant need not be a certified professional, many have taken a number of business courses and have a good working knowledge of balance sheets, cash flow, owner’s equity, and the chart of accounts. An accountant is responsible for completing financial reports and most are fully capable of handling quarterly IRS tax reports and filings, as well as the annual tax return for a small business. The CPA profession is regulated by the state of Florida and it requires ongoing training each year. Though this is not true for accountants, many are eager to stay current with any tax law changes or advancements in business and financial matters. Both the CPA and accountant perform very detailed financial work and understand the importance of getting reports and other work done correctly. In both professions, you will find highly skilled individuals with a passion for numbers. They are capable to provide a wide range of assistance to business owners from tax preparation and auditing to accounts payable and receivable."},{"prompt":"Make up a story that contains these words: chair, component, cranky, and lottery.

It wasn't unusual to find him awake late at night, sitting on a straight-backed wooden chair, slumped forward over his work desk, tinkering with a component or circuit by the light of a bright, fluorescent lamp. He loved his work, but as Steve aged, he found these late nights resulted in back and neck pain and blurry eyesight. He had also become impatient with his work and cranky with his customers. Steve needed a break. On his birthday, his grandmother bought him a lottery ticket, and although Steve never squandered money on such things, he was excited about the potential to win the 5 million jackpot. Two nights later, when it was time for the lottery drawing, Steve put aside his work to watch it live on his small office TV. He barely breathed as he watched, astonished, as each drawn ball contained a number on his ticket! Sadly, when it came to the last number, it was one digit off. Steve's hopes of becoming a millionaire and being able to retire were over, but he still won more than enough money to take a month off of work and take his grandmother on an extended luxury cruise. He didn't need to be a millionaire, anyway -- he just needed a little time away from work!"},{"prompt":"Can you create a good character description and bio that includes the height and weight of the character he is 6:7 Feet tall and weighs 290 Pounds his name is Mr.Sage he is a 50-year-old sensei who used to patrol the streets as a vigilante now he has given that life up to be a sensei and train his students be imaginative make him sound powerful and like a superhuman","completion":"Name: Mr. Sage Occupation: Sensei, Former Vigilante Height: 6'7\\" Weight: 290 pounds Bio: Mr. Sage is a fearless sensei with a remarkable past, which he is now striving to move forward from while imparting his wisdom to his students.

These changes can occur through mutation or through acquiring resistance genes from other bacteria via horizontal gene transfer. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both healthcare and agriculture settings have contributed significantly to the rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria."},{"prompt":"Write a blog post about a new food truck for llamas I am opening!","completion":"Hi everyone!

(The flyer depicts an anthropomorphic hippo wearing a Fireman's helmet, smiling and pointing at stormy clouds over the horizon) Hey kids! It's your friend, Hal! I'm a volunteer fireman as well as a hippo (did you know that I am a hippo?). I'm here to teach you all about how to stay safe when there's lightning. Now I know lightning seems frightening, and that's because Lightning can potentially be very dangerous! But if you take careful precautions to be safe, there's nothing to fear! When thunder roars, go indoors! A good place to shelter from lightning is inside a safe, enclosed shelter. Homes, offices, stores, and cars with windows rolled all the way up can serve as safe shelters until the storm passes. However, that does not mean you are completely safe! During the duration of your time in the safe shelter, make sure to stay away from contact with water. Do not bathe, shower, or wash dishes. Avoid using electronic equipment of all types. Do not use corded phones; they are not safe during a thunderstorm! But cordless and cellular phones are safe to use. But what if you can't make it indoors? Ideally, you should remain aware of forecasted weather conditions before venturing outdoors. But if you are caught out where you cannot easily access a safe, enclosed shelter, what you should do is minimize risk. But how do I minimize risk if I'm caught outdoors?? First things first, stay away from elevated areas such as hills, mountain ridges, or peaks. Never shelter under a lone tree or use a cliff or a rocky overhang as a shelter. Stay away from bodies of water like ponds or lakes. Don't clump up! If you are in a group, stay separate from each other. Do not stay in open vehicles like motorcycles or convertibles! Only enclosed vehicles are safe shelters. Finally, if you are unable to get to a safe shelter, it is best to crouch into a ball-like position with your heads tucked and hands over your ears, low and with minimal contact with the ground."},{"prompt":"How many inches are in a foot?","completion":"There are 12 inches in 1 foot.

He needed to act now, or many good men might never return to their families. The fatalities to the Japanese in the war thus far had already been too high, but no more would occur, not under his watch. Josh quickened his pace as he heard another muffled peal, and felt a small explosion rock the hull. He broke into a run. Several hours earlier, it had all been different. Nobody on board had expected to experience conflict; the trip was purely operational, after all, a routine test just off the coast. The crew had gone about their light duties lazily, with only the engines making any noise, the day monotonous and droning. There had been laughter, joking, card games and reading, the camaraderie of men settling in for a long trip, who had not yet tired of the novelty. Josh furrowed his brow. Who would do this to their country? By sabotaging the engines, they risked going down into a watery tomb with everyone else. Who was unscrupulous enough to do this? He had a good idea.

Those born in outlying areas are protected by the U.S. government, able to obtain a U.S. passport, able to live in the U.S. and apply for naturalization, and are entitled to consular protection from the U.S. The main difference is that U.S. nationals are restricted from voting in any U.S. election or applying for jobs that require citizenship."},{"prompt":"What is the perfect thing to wear at a fall event that is outside?","completion":"You know it's cold outside when you go outside and it's cold.

Keep the word count under 400 words. Make the article easy to read and understand.","completion":"Most people don’t think about back health but this is one area that is so important for overall good health throughout your lifetime. Your back supports your entire body. Remember when you were in grade school, your parents and teachers were always telling you to sit up straight? They reminded you that if you slump all the time or walk slumped over, this can permanently alter the curvature of your spine. This is actually true although it would take years of slumping to do this. The thing is though, that if we develop poor habits as youngsters, they often follow us through to adulthood. You rarely ever see classes or information on back health but some schools do teach this during science class or gym. If you’ve been having chronic backaches, then some simple back exercises can strengthen those muscles and cut down on the number of aspirin you have to take each day. You can practice sitting up properly best in a straight-backed chair. Sit down and press your back up against the chair back and take several deep breaths. Close your eyes and try to envision your spine completely straight. This combines bio-feedback with back exercises to help you be more aware of your spine and back. Walking and swimming are both good exercises for your back as well and they can improve your health in other areas. One exercise that stretches the back muscles and the backs of your legs at the same time is to stand up straight. Extend your hands to the ceiling, take a deep breath, and then release it as you bend forward touching your fingers to your toes. If you can, hold this position for a few moments. Here are a few other tips: 1. Never twist and bend at the same time. 2. Avoid carrying large, heavy purses or sling bags 3. Don’t slump while sitting watching TV or while driving the car. 4. Use a chair with a backrest and change positions often. 5. Choose a good mattress that lends support in all the right areas."},{"prompt":"I am planning a trip to Hawaii.

Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders. But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them. With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant. She’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise. Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret. Friends, enemies, lovers.

Switch to LED Lights Although LED lights may cost more than traditional light bulbs, they will help you save tons of money on your energy costs over time. Switching to LED bulbs is an excellent way to conserve energy and save on your electric bill. LED lights will not just help you save on your energy bill, but they can also help you save money on your overall lighting costs since they last at least 25 times longer than traditional bulbs. That means you will not need to replace your light bulbs as often. 2. Do Not Leave Your Refrigerator Door Open We all look inside our fridge as we decide what we want to eat. But did you know that doing so can cause you to waste a lot of energy? It takes more time for your refrigerator to cool back down after the doors have been open for several minutes. To eliminate this extra cost, try deciding on what you want to eat before you open your fridge doors to help reduce the amount of energy used. 3. Keep Your Oven Door Closed If you frequently open your oven door while cooking, it will take twice as long to get back to the cooking temperature. Instead of opening your oven door all the time, consider using an oven light if your oven has a window on the door that allows you to peek inside. 4. Shut Down your Electronics One of the easiest things you can do to help save on energy costs is to shut down your electronics when they are not in use. We all tend to leave our devices such as our TV and laptop on making it more convenient than waiting for it to boot up again. But leaving your devices on while they are not in use can contribute to your high energy costs. When we leave devices plugged into an outlet, they are still using power. This is something known as \\"phantom power\\". To help reduce your energy use and costs, try connecting everything to a power bar and turning that off whenever you leave the house. 5. Decrease Energy Use During Peak Hours These days, many homes are now equipped with smart meters that keep track of when you are using the most energy throughout the day. If you are interested in conserving energy, you should use most of your electricity during non-peak hours. By doing so, you will save as much as 10 cents per kilowatt. 6. Make Use of Small Appliances If you are cooking a small meal, you will want to make good use of your smaller appliances instead of firing up your large electric oven. Toaster ovens, electric skillets, air fryers, and other countertop appliances are now versatile enough to help you create a full-course meal without using a ton of energy. 7. Wash Laundry in Cold Water Only If you have any delicate items in your wardrobe, you may already know about the benefits of washing your clothes in cold water. Doing so can help your clothing last longer and the fabric is less likely to shrink. Another great benefit of using cold water while doing laundry is that it will help keep your electricity bill low. It is estimated that as much as 90% of the energy used by your washing machine is spent on heating your water. Therefore, many consumers have caught on to the benefits of using cold water to wash their laundry."},{"prompt":"Write a medium-length (<300 words) email from White Horse Boarding to its customers and potential customers about their vet services.

I know for sure you've all heard about the fashion rule that says wearing white after labor day is a big no-no. Well, today we will find out where this rule came from. There are several thoughts of who came up with the rule but the most accepted one says that it came from wealthy people at the turn of the century who wanted to make sure they stood out from ordinary people and the newly rich. They wore bright whites while vacationing while those that remained in the city wore darker clothes. There's another theory that says it happened after Labor Day was made a national holiday. The wealthy put away their white clothes to signify that Summer was over. Okay, so now that we've got that history lesson out of the way. Let's talk about breaking this so-called rule. People may think that wearing white to a party or picnic might cause a big scene, but you've got to remember that fashion is all about creativity and fun.

I would like for it to be no more than 3 paragraphs long, please.","completion":"Sea turtles throughout our world's oceans are rapidly disappearing. The sea turtle population has been in a state of rapid decline due to human interference. Marine pollution has been a major factor in the drop in the sea turtle population. Things like sewage disposal, oil spills, and toxic waste are harming the reptile group greatly. In addition to this, there are 100 million tons of plastic in our oceans, 80% of which comes from people. Many turtles are killed or injured due to plastic trash alone but the harm that is being done to this aquatic reptile doesn't stop there. About 250, 000 turtles have been captured, injured, or killed by fishermen, often even by accident. Fishing nets used to catch other ocean creatures have captured many sea turtles by mistake. The nets keep the turtles held underwater and cause them to drown. According to the data, the issue is very severe. One species in particular, the leatherback, has had its population decline by 40% in the past three generations according to the NOAA. Needless to say, something must be done about our precious sea turtle population. Nearly all species of sea turtles have made their way onto the endangered species list. Some steps we could take to try and reverse this catastrophe include participating in coastal cleanups, reducing the rate at which we use single-use plastics, and even conserving the water we use at home. Those are things we can all do as individuals to help. However, we must also hold corporations that dump toxic waste into the ocean accountable. Although it is illegal in most places to dump waste into the ocean, that does not stop it from happening. The ocean is a very difficult place to regulate and perhaps society as a whole should at the very least try to make these regulations even more strict to better enforce these rules but it is easier said than done. In conclusion, the world's sea turtle population is in rapid descent due to ecological factors caused by humans that affect their immediate environment. There is currently little we can do to reverse the situation, but I wanted to help bring attention to it so that we may all do our part in reducing plastic use and helping stop other waste from affecting our oceans. Turtles are not the only sea creatures harmed by these atrocities, they are simply the most affected. I hope my essay inspires whoever reads it to make changes in their everyday lives to help our endangered turtle friends as well as all of the other ocean creatures impacted by marine pollution and the other factors I mentioned to continue to survive.

Show me a numbered list of tips to follow to make the move easier mentally and physically.","completion":"Transitioning from your childhood bedroom to a college dorm can make you feel overwhelmed and scared. Hopefully, the following four tips will help you make a smoother shift from home to a college living situation. Congratulations on making the big move toward an independent future! 1. Ask your family, friends, and loved ones for help. You’ll probably need physical help making the move to college, but you’ll also need support and emotional help. For many college newbies, it’s not easy to leave the familiarity of a childhood home but knowing that you have the emotional support and love of those that you care about can give you a much-needed confidence boost and lessen your doubt or anxieties. 2. Sharing a dorm? Be open-minded as to who your roommate may be. While you can request a specific type of dorm room, it’s not often that you can request a specific type of roommate. So, be open-minded and respectful of whoever you’ve been paired with. You’ll be spending a lot of time together in the same space, so you must establish a cordial rapport from the start. If you and your roommate have too many differences, you can always request a transfer later in the school year. 3. Pack the essentials, but save décor and organizational extras for after you’ve moved in. Toiletries, clothes, and comfort items, like a favorite blanket, are all essential for any college student on move-in day. Otherwise, everything else is extra that can wait until you’ve settled into your dorm room. Don’t overload the car with things that you don’t need right away. There are stores and shops galore in college towns, so it should be easy to find any décor or organizational tools that you may need after you’ve officially transitioned from home to college. 4. Anxious? Arrive on campus earlier than everyone else to ensure you don’t get caught in the move-in rushes. Anxiety is the biggest problem for most new college students, especially because they don’t want to feel dumb or make a fool of themselves on the first day around everyone else. It’s a common fear, and one that’s typically unfounded, particularly when everyone is worried about the same things. However, you can lessen your anxiety by planning on earlier arrivals. If you’ve packed only the essentials, it should be easy for you to find your room and get settled in before the other students make a mad dash to do the same. The general rule of thumb for anxious students is to arrive two to three hours before the move-in rushes."},{"prompt":"Come up with an excerpt from the sixth chapter (out of 20) of a novel that follows a family through multiple generations as they attempt to gain power and success.","completion":"Edgar Raines - as he was known to the rest of the financial world - had achieved success on his own, without the help of his prestigious family's name. Seeking to make a name for himself, Edgar set out on a journey that took him from the city of Guadalajara, Mexico, to Orange County, California, where he quickly sought employment at the closest and most available job opportunity he could find. In this case, it was as a cashier at a local In-N-Out burger restaurant. Edgar decided to change his name before his job interview, declining to go by his birthname (Edgar Ramirez) as he believed a less ethnic name would open more doors and create more opportunities down the road. Edgar also wanted to put as much distance between himself and the Ramirez family name to ensure any opportunities he gained would not be based on the fact that his family name was synonymous with the Mexican-American oil company established several generations before his own time. Edgar desired to be a self-made man, someone who could prove to the rest of the world - and himself - that success can be achieved in one's lifetime, and that it doesn't necessarily rely on already being rich. In-N-Out cashier was the first successful venture he crossed off his list. The next: manager. And then the next: corporate. Edgar Raines' reputation as a rock-steady, reliable, hardworking individual preceded him. In his corporate role, Edgar implemented many changes to the In-N-Out business process that were used to streamline the making of their food, reduce costs, and line franchise owners' and business executives' pockets with cash. Instead of resting on his laurels, Edgar had a sound investment strategy in place: he invested chiefly in Apple stock and Bitcoin before they went parabolic, and he became a sort of \\"stock whisperer\\" in the process. The name Edgar Raines was known for quality, success, and achievement, with many drawing comparisons to Edgar and to another famous name that was equated with those attributes: Ramirez."},{"prompt":"Create a bullet-point list about 10 cities and towns in Georgia and facts or information about them.

The story should be bittersweet with just a hint of uncertainty, as if visiting her dead relatives is something unnatural, thus dangerous. Leave it with a cliffhanger of her being trapped in the other dimension.","completion":"Kyra hadn't been the same after the loss of her mother. She'd been through many milestones in her life—buying a car, getting married, finding a home, having kids—but it was losing her mom that was proving to be the greatest challenge of all. Her mother had died peacefully in her sleep, but Kyra couldn't reckon with a lifetime of living to justify one iota of death. Still, she was coping; the hole in her heart was smaller every day, albeit by a little. Looking at the painting helped. Her great, great uncle Keith had been an exceptional artist, and at some point, he'd gathered as many family members as he could find, both near and far, to be painted. His work was immaculate, with clear, recognizable features on every person. He must have truly loved them. She would brew a cup of tea in the morning and spend some time with the painting before heading to work. She didn't recognize many faces, but it was comforting to know that they had passed on like her mother. That was an odd thing to appreciate, she knew, but it gave her solace, nonetheless. One day, in a moment of strong emotion, she touched the painting. The world seemed to shimmer around her, and she found herself in another world entirely. Somehow, she remained calm, possessed with the strong inclination that she should show no emotion in this place of reverence. She had some inking of where she was, too. In some way, she recognized the gathering place up ahead as the place she would one day live with her family after this life. It was cast with a silver sheen; everything seemed slightly out of focus, as if the existence of the place was constantly being challenged and only maintained by conscious effort—perhaps that was exactly the cause. Up ahead, she saw her mother, and despite the thumping of her heart and the inner voice warning her to go back, she raced toward her, calling out her name. The figure disappeared as Kyra approached, leaving her alone at the table. A sense of dread washed over her, and Kyra turned to leave the same way she had come, but the painting was nowhere to be seen."},{"prompt":"Write a social media post that talks about the Large Hadron Collider.

I was aware of it previously, but I didn't look into it until today. This thing's pretty amazing, so let me tell you about it. It's a particle accelerator, and its job is to smash tiny particles together. It's built inside a huge underground tunnel that's 27 kilometers long. The tunnel is a closed loop though, it's not just a tunnel that goes 27 km away from the starting point. The collider uses magnets and other arrangements to accelerate particles to nearly the speed of light. At this point, the particles are put on a collision course with each other and ultimately collide. The magnets I referred to previously have to be kept at a temperature of ‑271.3°C. There are thousands of magnets in the collider, so it makes sense it's a long loop. One thing that's amazing about the LHC is the precision with which it operates. It has to collide tiny particles into each other, so you can imagine trying to shoot two needles at each other from 10km apart and trying to make them collide — it's no easy task! The collider is operated by the wonderful people at the CERN Control Centre, and I'd encourage you all to learn more.

While Howl pursues his ever-changing paramours, Michael Fisher, Howl's apprentice, handles the bulk of the day-to-day activities of the wizarding business. For Sophie, Michael acts as a steady and dependable figure, guiding her through the often perplexing and uncertain world of the moving castle. His unflinching support and dedication to Howl, in particular, are crucial in assisting the wizard in facing his past and overcoming his fears. After Prince Justin, the King of Ingary's younger brother, vanishes while attempting to locate the Wizard Suliman, the King orders Howl to find them both and slay the Witch of the Waste.

By throwing from the same spot and aiming for an object in the distance, you can adjust the throw angle to the wind. This is very important. The boomerang should be nearly vertical on release. Increasing the tilt angle makes it fly higher and land further back. Holding it more vertically makes it fly lower and land further forward.

To make herbal vinegar using the hot vinegar method you will need to first heat the vinegar you choose to use in a pot until it is just below boiling temperature.

If you want more flavor, you can leave the herbs in the jar for up to a month before straining them out.

Did you guys catch that on the news today? Now I'm not saying he's too old to ride a bike, but maybe he shouldn't be operating such heavy machinery like that. No, but seriously folks, the president took a little spill, and he's totally fine. He got up, brushed himself off, and just like you or me, he pretended it didn't happen. You've got to admire a guy of his age even getting on his bike, much less getting on, falling off, then getting on again. Truly an impressive display of sporting skill. The only thing more dangerous than Biden on a bicycle is Biden in front of a plate of ribs. Talk about hand-eye coordination; if you want to learn how to get more ribs on you than in you, well, Biden's got a few things to teach you. Still, is there anything more apropos than our president falling off his bicycle right when America is about to fall off a fiscal cliff? It's times like these that I start believing in fate. It's almost too good, but I can't make these things up. But no, it's all fine; Biden's a good guy, a good sport, a real spry fellow. Notice how nobody young ever gets called spry? Well anyway, Biden's a real spry guy, and thank the heavens he wore a helmet. He'll be back in tip-top shape shortly so let's wish him the best and a speedy recovery. Skinned knees are no joke when you're handling nuclear football. In the meantime, maybe someone around that place can keep that bike in the garage.

We have been in business since 2019 and continued to do business despite the pandemic, selling our cookies from home to local stores, businesses, and even online. Since 2019, Captain Cookies has sold a total of 300,000 worth of cookies to stores and businesses around the world. However, the number of cookies we make in our tiny kitchen cannot meet the overwhelming demand we have received recently due to a hugely successful TikTok campaign that came out several months ago and created a craze for our product. Therefore, we are now applying for a loan of 100,000 to help our business meet the growing demand for our cookies. Business Plan Our business plan involves the following: 1. Leasing a new 1,000-square-foot warehouse building; 2. Purchasing the necessary equipment (ovens, mixers) and packaging (plastic bags, twist ties, labels) to make and package 1,000 cookies a day, which would be an increase from the 200 cookies we currently produce from our current kitchen; 3. Paying for utilities (electricity, Internet access for POS systems, and online sales). 5-Year Plan The 5-year plan for Captain Cookies will see our company expanding from a single kitchen to a larger warehouse kitchen that will accommodate the increase in demand for our cookies. Within the first year, we plan to start a business relationship with a large international coffee chain that operates from Washington State; this coffee chain has agreed to purchase 10,000 cookies for a first purchase order for one of their local stores as a test market, with the agreement to buy an additional 100,000 cookies if that particular campaign is successful. We plan to do approximately 500,000 in sales by year three. By year five, we anticipate that with current sales, as well as the added relationship with the coffee chain and catering to a larger online market, we will do approximately 1 million in sales. We anticipate making our final payment on the loan before year four."},{"prompt":"Hi, I am a tourist who just landed in Chicago, Illinois.

But we, as individuals, can slow down this destructive force by implementing sustainable actions within our communities. Here are six simple yet impactful actions to fight climate change locally: 1. Reduce emissions: Use your car less, and opt for sustainable transportation like biking or public transit. Choose trains over airplanes for long-distance travel. Remember, even a tiny speed increases significantly raise CO2 emissions and expenses. 2. Save energy: Be mindful of appliance labels, avoid standby mode, and adjust heating and air conditioning thermostats. Conserving energy benefits both the planet and your wallet. 3. Embrace the 3 R's of sustainability: Reduce consumption, reuse items through second-hand markets and bartering, and recycle packaging and electronic waste. Recycling just half of your household garbage can save over 730 kilos of CO2 annually. 4. Adopt a low-carbon diet: Reduce meat consumption (a major contributor to atmospheric pollution), prioritize local and seasonal food, and avoid excessive packaging and processed foods. 5. Act against forest loss: Prevent fire hazards, choose sustainably sourced wood products, and plant trees. 6. Make demands from the government: Advocate for renewable energy, promote transparent product labeling, support sustainable transportation, and encourage responsible waste management through recycling and reuse. 7. Remember, the power lies within us to demand change from governments and raise global awareness of the climate crisis. Think globally, act locally. Your actions are crucial in the fight against climate change. Together, let us make a difference and create a more sustainable future. Thank you."},{"prompt":"What is the smallest dinosaur paleontologists have discovered? What is its size, and what is the date of its discovery?","completion":"The smallest fossil dinosaur ever found is Oculudentavis khaungraae, which was discovered and described in early 2020. It was initially presented as a hummingbird-sized toothed bird but, after its reveal in Nature magazine in March 2020, fellow researchers pointed out that Oculudentavis was a small reptile. The fossil resembled a bird due to its large eye-opening and narrow, beak-like snout. A second fossil was presented later in 2020 which added evidence that Oculucentavis was a lizard."},{"prompt":"Can you write an email to parents from a teacher explaining a classroom incident where peanut butter birthday treats were brought into the classroom?

Make it super simple and understandable to anyone.","completion":"In the game of football, both teams send out eleven players onto the field. Throughout the game, one team will be on offense, and one will be on defense. The offensive team’s objective is to get the football into the endzone while the defensive team is trying to stop that from happening. The offensive team has four chances, called downs, to move forward 10 yards. If, within those four downs, they do not make it ten yards, the ball is turned over to the other team, and they switch to offense. But if the offensive team does make it ten yards, they get another four downs to get it another ten yards, and this goes on until they hopefully make it across the endzone and score. The ball can be moved by running with it or passing it by throwing it. If the defensive team intercepts the ball, then they take possession and become the offensive team. But if the ball is in the hands of an offensive player, the defensive players can stop them from gaining any more yards by tackling them to the ground. Running or passing the ball over the endzone results in six points for the offensive team, then they have the opportunity to kick the ball through the goal post (the big yellow y-shape post) for one extra point or run it across again for two extra points. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins."},{"prompt":"Write a free-verse poem about a sheep making an apple pie.

History of Earth Day Celebrate Earth Day with these tips for helping our environment. BY ROSE DAVIDSON Our planet is an amazing place, but it needs our help to thrive! That’s why each year on April 22, more than a billion people celebrate Earth Day to protect the planet from things like pollution and deforestation. By taking part in activities like picking up litter and planting trees, we’re making our world a happier, healthier place to live. The first Earth Day was celebrated in 1970, when a United States senator from Wisconsin organized a national demonstration to raise awareness about environmental issues. Rallies took place across the country and, by the end of the year, the U.S. government had created the Environmental Protection Agency. By 1990, Earth Day was an event celebrated by more than 140 countries around the globe. You can celebrate and protect the planet at the same time. Check out these Earth Day ideas to help save the planet any time of year. BECOME A WASTE WARRIOR The number of garbage trucks Americans fill each year would stretch halfway to the moon. Toilet paper tubes, made from cardboard, take two months to decompose in a landfill. A plastic bottle sticks around for way longer—it can take over 450 years to break down! But instead of turning to the trash bin, you could turn these items into an awesome telescope or a flower planter. Before you throw something away, think about whether it can be recycled or repurposed. You can also limit waste by reducing the amount of things you buy. For example, check the library for that book you have to read before visiting the store. PLANT A TREE Researchers estimate roughly 15 billion trees in the world are cut down each year, so help offset that loss by planting a tree of your own. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen for people to breathe. They also provide shelter and food for animals such as squirrels and owls. Depending on where trees are planted, their shade can even reduce the need for air-conditioning in hotter months. How many more reasons do you need to go green? TURN OFF THE LIGHTS Does that lamp really need to be on while the sun is out? Electricity doesn’t just happen—it has to be produced from things around us. A lot of times it comes from fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, or natural gas) that contribute to climate change. But electricity can also be made from renewable sources like wind, water, the sun, and even elephant dung! No matter where it’s coming from, try conserving electrical energy by using only what you need. LIMIT YOUR WATER USAGE Turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth can conserve up to eight gallons of water a day. It might seem like it’s everywhere, but clean, drinkable water is a limited resource. In fact less than one percent of the water on Earth can be used by humans. (The rest is either too salty or too difficult to access.) Turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth can conserve up to eight gallons of water a day. To help save even more water, challenge yourself to take a shorter shower (but still get clean!). OFFER YOUR TIME With a parent’s permission, volunteer to pick up trash at a nearby park, start a collection drive for recyclable items, or organize a screening of an environmentally themed movie. By getting involved and working with others, you’re not just helping the Earth—you’re making new friends too! SPREAD THE MESSAGE Talk to your friends and family members about what you’re doing and ask them to help. Need to get the conversation started? Get everyone together and reconnect with nature by taking one of our Get Outside challenges, or check out some other green tips you can share. The more people do, the better off our planet will be!","completion":"Earth Day is celebrated every year by more than a billion people across the globe on April 22nd.

The two different events should have at least 6 degrees of separation, like the Kevin Bacon game.","completion":"One day, Michael went to the local coffee shop to get his usual drink: a large black coffee. Michael was a boring person who liked routines and didn't venture out of his comfort zone for any reason. However, on this day, Michael decided to try something new: instead of a large black coffee, he wanted to try a medium iced caramel macchiato with whipped cream. For some reason, Michael felt a little goofy today and wanted to see what it was like being outside his comfort zone for once. Michael went through the drive-through and ordered his drink, then went to the next window to pay. He received his drink and had a sip: it was cold, tasty, sugary, and much more vibrant than he cared for. He was so put off by the in-your-face tastiness of the macchiato that he threw the drink cup out of his car window into the middle of traffic. Little did Michael know, this incident would set off a chain reaction of events that would result in tragedy. The coffee cup he threw out the window ended up hitting a passer-by in another vehicle, causing the driver to momentarily veer off the road and crash into a utility pole. The utility pole fell onto the roadway and caused a road closure that would last for several hours. While the road closure was going on, the driver of a transport truck carrying a supply of fried chicken for a nearby restaurant decided to drive through the obstruction and ended up overturning and spilling the chicken on the road. The nearby restaurant ran out of chicken and would have to be shut down for the day due to the failure of the delivery truck to deliver their chicken. As a result, all restaurant workers had to go home for the day. One of the workers, a young teen who was bored, decided to go to the store to buy fireworks to play with at home. The worker ended up lighting a bottle rocket that flew errantly through the open window of a fireworks factory, which caused the fireworks within to catch fire and explode and cause the entire factory to explode and go up in flames."},{"prompt":"Write an email inviting my parents to an Easter Celebration.

Do I need to be careful where I plant them, so they don't get overharvested? Are there any I should avoid?","completion":"Chickens can eat almost any cooking herb that you'd commonly plant in your garden, but some are more beneficial to the chickens than others. Here are some with noted health benefits: • Mint: Mint's powerful smell can help combat any undesirable coup fumes and also keep insects at bay. In addition, it can encourage new feather growth in chickens and has been said to have a calming effect. (Calmer hens equals more eggs!) It can even be served fresh, frozen, or dried, and obviously has many household uses, as well. Because mint is a prolific grower, it's safe to plant near the coup. If it spreads inside, the chickens can trim the excess without harming the overall supply. • Lavender: Lavender is calming for chickens and humans alike! In addition, it has a lovely smell that mixes well with mint and other herbs. This smell helps dispel pests. Lavender is also good for the circulatory system, increasing blood flow when hens might not be moving around as much (during winter, cold snaps, or when sitting on eggs.) The seed-shaped flowers of lavender are also enjoyable for chickens to forage, providing some mental exercise. • Oregano: Oregano's smell deters pests and mixes wonderfully with the basil and tomatoes in your garden (which chickens also love!) Oregano grows best when harvested often, so whole springs can be hung in your coup for the chickens to pick at and scavenge. It's a natural antibiotic that's full of vitamins and antioxidants. You can even add dried oregano into your feed for these benefits, although it won't be as potent as fresh sprigs. • Thyme: Thyme, like the others, is aromatic and mixes wonderfully with the smell of lavender. (Just check your soap scents!) Like oregano, thyme is a natural antibiotic that also aids in respiratory stability. Thyme spreads, like mint, so it's safe to plant near the coup and let the chickens control the excess. It can be hung in full sprigs like oregano or dried. Additionally, any of these herbs can be soaked in vinegar and used as an all-natural pest control due to their aromatics.

Calor: Calor means \\"heat\\" in Latin, making it a great name for a wizard who specializes in fire magic. It is a simple two-syllable name that is easy to remember. 2. Spark: A spark is a small particle thrown from a fire, making it a good name for a fire wizard. It's also one syllable and easy to remember. It would make a good name for a wizard with a bright and \\"sparky\\" personality. 3. Blaze: Blaze is a cool, one-syllable name. It is a word used to describe a particularly large fire or one that is hard to extinguish, making it a great name for a fire wizard. 4. Flame: Flame is the name given to the visible part of a fire. If something catches fire, a common phrase is that it \\"went up in flames\\". The name is one syllable long, which makes it easy to say and remember. Water: 1. Aqua: Aqua is Latin for water and a common word many people associate with water. It's also two syllables and easy to pronounce. 2.

The name is only one syllable and is easy to pronounce and remember. Generic: 1. Wiz: \\"Wiz\\" is a shortened version of the word wizard. It is also similar to the word \\"whiz\\", which can be used to describe something that moves quickly or a person who is extremely clever and skilled in a particular field. It would be a great name with a double meaning for a wizard who has an outgoing personality and never stays still. 2. Whitebeard: In popular culture, wizards are often depicted with long white beards. If you decide to go down the route of using a fire or water wizard, then Redbeard or Bluebeard could also be used (though \\"Bluebeard\\" is already used as a name in a popularly known work of fiction)."},{"prompt":"Generate five sentences about using nasturtiums as a trap crop to keep aphids off of tomato plants.","completion":"Nasturtium plants attract aphids and can serve as a trap crop to keep these pests away from tomatoes and other veggies.

They make a tasty and beautiful addition to fresh summer salads."},{"prompt":"Can you write me a function in python that takes an input list, then returns a list with all duplicate elements removed with order retained? I'd like you to use a lambda function to accomplish this.","completion":"I'm happy to help with that! To accomplish what you asked for, we first create a set so we can track whether we've already added an element or not. Then, we will use the filter method, which will only pass through elements that evaluate to true in a given function and assign it a lambda function that checks whether the given element is in the existing set or not. Note that in Python, the add method returns None and not a boolean value about the existence of the element like in other languages such as Java. So the return statement of our lambda function first checks whether x is already in the set or not. If it's not in the set, then we want to add the element x to the set and return true (so to return true from a value of None, we must add a not condition in front of it). def unique(n): added = set() return list(filter(lambda x: ( x not in added and not added.add(x) ) , n))"},{"prompt":"Give me a list of 5 US national parks that are the least visited.

However, anecdotal evidence and personal experience tell me that this is the case. Before anyone gets offended or defensive, as I said, these are my personal observations and hypotheses as someone who has traveled quite a bit, lived overseas, and interacted with people of various nationalities in both my personal and professional life. 1. The United States is massive, so why leave? The first thing that comes to mind is that Americans can basically go on any type of vacation they want without leaving their home country! The US is an ideal geographic location for a nation. You can wander the dramatic coastlines of the Pacific Northwest, traverse the desert out west, go skiing in the mountains, visit any one of America’s lakes or rivers for watersports, and have a stunning beach vacation in the Gulf of Mexico all without ever leaving the country. 2. Americans don’t have the same work and career flexibility as other nationalities. Even though this is changing slightly with more remote work opportunities and hybrid work settings becoming more mainstream, generally speaking, Americans do not have the same flexibility related to their work schedule as Europeans, for example. 3. Americans are simply more hesitant to visit other countries. I hate to use the word “scared,” but, I think that in America, we are raised to think that the world is a big, scary, and dangerous place. However, without getting political or anything like that, the US is actually rated 28th for homicide in 2023, which is higher than any other developed country and higher than many developing ones. I recognize that this is just one statistic, but one can’t deny that America is no longer the “safe” place it perhaps once was. 4. Many Americans lack exposure to other cultures. This isn’t anyone's fault, and it’s not detrimental or anything, it’s just an observation. Most of the rest of the world has American culture injected into their newsfeeds, music, television, and other forms of entertainment and popular culture. Whereas in America, we view all of our own culture and no one else’s for the most part. This tends to lower the baseline level of curiosity about the rest of the world for much of the American youth."},{"prompt":"Provide three effective strategies for managing stress in the workplace, considering the well-being of employees and overall productivity.","completion":"Sure! Here are some effective strategies for managing workplace stress considering the well-being of employees and overall productivity. 1. Prioritize Workplace Wellness Workplace stress can significantly impact the well-being and productivity of employees. Encourage healthy living and exercise by providing opportunities for employees to take a break and engage in physical activity. Consider subsidizing gym memberships or bringing a yoga instructor into the office. You can also hold a steps contest among teams for those who own fitness trackers and offer healthy snacks in the office. Such initiatives show that you care about your employees' health and well-being. 2. Revamp the Work Environment The physical environment of the workplace can significantly contribute to employee stress levels. Make changes that increase employee enjoyment, such as updating the office with an upbeat color scheme, additional plants, or new silverware. If space permits, consider adding a ping pong or foosball table. Such changes can help employees take their minds off work-related stress for a few minutes. 3. Allow for Flexible Hours and Remote Working Offering flexibility in working hours and remote working options can be an effective strategy to reduce workplace stress. Employees with control over their work schedules can better manage their workload and balance work and personal responsibilities. This approach also shows that you trust your employees to deliver high-quality work regardless of location."},{"prompt":"Sparrow, I am enlisting your help.

If they were involved in the development, what was their role on the team?","completion":"The Animal Crossing series was conceptualized and created by Katsuya Eguchi. The first game of the series, Animal Crossing (known in its home country of Japan as Dobutso no Mori+) was inspired by Eguchi's relocation to Kyoto after being hired by Nintendo. Eguchi has said on record that he had to leave his friends and family behind when he moved to Kyoto, which left him lonely. He realized that being close to those he cared about was a great, important thing. He wondered if it were possible to recreate the importance of all the things he was missing- spending time, talking, and playing with those you care for in a game. That was the spark of inspiration for Eguchi and he became one of the co-directors of the game."},{"prompt":"Write a short article (about 200 words) on a new concept being developed by Holtec International that provides dry cask storage for spent nuclear fuel. It should sound like an authoritative article and have a serious, collegiate tone.","completion":"The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a hugely important job in making sure the nuclear waste produced by reactors is safely stored. There’s a lengthy and dangerous process involved in the storage of this nuclear fuel. It spends five years in a reactor, then another five years in pools of water where the fuel is allowed to cool down enough to move to other locations for storage. This process costs the U.S. billions of dollars each year. Naturally, the NRC is always looking for new and more affordable ways to store nuclear waste. A new concept being developed by Holtec International provides dry cask storage for spent nuclear fuel that is safe for 100 years. Holtec has been responsible for handling nuclear waste since 1986. They provide both wet fuel storage systems and dry casks. These are designed to provide the necessary radiation shielding and heat removal for safe long-term storage. The new dry casks will have additional structural integrity to protect the world from the dangers of nuclear waste. These are important issues that should concern the whole planet."},{"prompt":"Classify this product review as positive, neutral, or negative: Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2023 Fit Type: Classic FitSize: SmallColor: T Shirt - Boys - 5 Pack - WhiteVerified Purchase These T-shirts were a great value!

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) Overview: Widespread attack of inflammation in the central nervous system thought to be provoked by an infectious cause or occurring post vaccination Features: • Multifocal areas of diffuse inflammation most often seen in the subcortical cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord • Usually monophasic but can be recurrent Symptoms: • Encephalopathy: confusion, irritability, AMS (somnolence to coma) • Multifocal deficits, fever, meningismus (headache, photophobia, stiff neck) Imaging: • Large (greater than 1 to 2 cm) multifocal, hyperintense, bilateral, asymmetric lesions in the supra-/infratentorial white matter on T2-weighted or MRI FLAIR images • Can be seen in gray matter, especially basal ganglia and thalamus Resources: • National Institutes of Health Accute Optic Neuritis (AON) Overview: Optic neuritis is retrobulbar inflammation of the optic nerve that can occur spontaneously or be associated with other neurologic conditions such as MS, ADEM, NMO or lupus. Features: • Usually unilateral • Dimished visual acuity, red color desaturation, afferent pupillary defect, and visual field deficits Symptoms: • Headache and painful eye movements • Central visual blurring • Dim vision • Complete loss of vision Imaging: • MRI often shows gadolinium enhancement of the optic nerve Resources: • American Academy of Ophthalmology Transverse Myelitis Features: • Spinal cord dysfunction typically owing to inflammatory lesion • Usually presents as a CIS, but may be associated with MS or ADEM Symptoms: • Unilateral or bilateral motor or sensory deficits such as Paresthesias, weakness, sphincter dysfunction; can occasionally be more severe, including paraplegia and urinary retention Imaging: • Gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI spreading over 1 or more segments Resource: • National MS Society • Christopher Reeves Foundation Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) Overview: Neuromyelitis Optica and neuromyelitis optical spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are inflammatory conditions of the central nervous system primarily targeting the optic nerve and spinal cord. Features: • Optic neuritis • Acute myelitis • Postrema clinical syndrome • Acute brainstem syndrome • Symptomatic narcolepsy or acute diencephalic clinical syndrome with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesions • Symptomatic cerebral syndrome with NMOSD-typical brain lesions • More common in non-Caucasians, especially Asians • Important to rule out sarcoid, SLE, Sjogrens or other vasculitis Symptoms: • Optic neuritis (see above) • Transverse myelitis (see above) • Intractable hiccups or nausea and vomiting","completion":"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a widespread attack of inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) believed to be caused by an infection or occurring after vaccination. It usually occurs in one episode but may reoccur. There is diffuse inflammation in multiple areas including the brainstem, spinal cord, and subcortical cerebellum. Symptoms of ADEM typically include encephalopathy (Including confusion, irritability, and aggressive multiple sclerosis resulting in somnolence to coma) as well as multifocal deficits, fever, and meningismus (Headache, photophobia, and stiff neck). Imaging detecting ADEM will consist of large (Meaning greater than one to two centimeters), multifocal, bilateral, asymmetric, and hyperintense lesions. These lesions are typically seen in the supra/infratentorial white matter on MRI FLAIR or T2-weighted images but also may be seen in gray matter, especially the thalamus and basal ganglia. Acute Optic Neuritis (AON) is a retrobulbar inflammation of the optic nerve that occurs on an acute basis. It may be associated with various neurologic conditions including MS, ADEM, NMO, or lupus; it can also occur spontaneously. It is usually unilateral and presents with lessened visual acuity, desaturation of red color, visual field deficits, and afferent pupillary defect. Symptoms typically include headache, painful eye movements, dim vision, and central visual blurring, and may produce complete loss of vision. About imaging, an MRI will frequently show gadolinium enhancement of the optic nerve. Transverse Myelitis is another condition that normally presents as a CIS but may be connected with MS or ADEM. It involves spinal cord dysfunction regularly owing to inflammatory lesion(s). It generates unilateral or bilateral sensory and/or motor deficits such as weakness, sphincter dysfunction, and paresthesias. It can sometimes present more severely, including urinary retention and paraplegia. When imaged, it will show gadolinium-enhancing lesions spreading over one or more segments on MRI. Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) and related neuromyelitis optical spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are inflammatory conditions principally involving the spinal cord and optic nerve in the central nervous system. Features include postrema clinical syndrome, acute myelitis, optic neuritis, acute brainstem syndrome, symptomatic cerebral syndrome with NMOSD-typical lesions of the brain, and acute diencephalic clinical syndrome or symptomatic narcolepsy with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesions. NMO occurs more often in non-Caucasians, particularly Asians. When considering NMO and NMOSD, it is important to rule out Sjogrens, SLE, sarcoid, or other vasculitis. In addition to the previous features listed, symptoms may also include intractable hiccups, nausea, and/or vomiting."},{"prompt":"Where can I find bald eagles?

They are also very popular in Alaska, along the coasts, the Rocky Mountains, and the Mississippi River area. Other areas in the United state can see bald eagles during their winter migration. They tend to gather near lakes and prefer areas with fish and forests. They have been seen near unfrozen lakes in the winter and hunting the coast. During migration times, they are seen near any type of water. Bald eagles mostly like fish. They are predators and when fish is not readily available, they will eat whatever they can catch. That includes rodents and other small birds. They can scavage for food as well, stealing food from other birds if the opportunity arises."},{"prompt":"I can't believe my car broke down again!

William 206 robots were created as manufacturing robots, meaning that their main purpose was to assist with building products on an assembly line. However, assembly line-type production stopped nearly 75 years ago, after the beginning of World War III. William 206 scanned their vast desert home, looking for others such as themselves, but could not find any companions. However, one day, a dump truck came by, looking for metal to salvage. The driver of the dump truck noticed William 206 rolling across the sand dunes and captured William. William was taken to a large warehouse for disassembling. At the warehouse, William 206 ran into Bill 207, another robot. Bill 207 explained how they were also a manufacturing type of robot and had memories of working on an assembly line. Bill 207 told William of his past adventures after the beginning of World War III, and how he hid for long periods of time among the sand dunes to escape metal recyclers.

I've never understood what makes a joke work, much less, what a shaggy dog story is. Explain how jokes work and exactly what is a shaggy dog story. It will be helpful if you give examples along with the explanation.","completion":"Every joke consists of a set-up which, like the exposition of a play, tells the listener or reader everything necessary to understand the finale called the punch line which, in itself needs to be unexpected based on the set-up. Here is an example. Set-up: A skeleton walks into a bar. The bartender asks, “What will you have?” The skeleton says, Punch line: “A beer and a mop. The set-up puts the image of a skeleton, a bar, and the bartender in the listener’s mind and presents a question. The listener will try to anticipate how the skeleton will respond, which, unless the listener had heard the joke before, they will be unlikely to guess. This creates tension in the listener. The unexpected answer found in the punchline surprises the listener who laughs because of the surprise that releases the tension. A Shaggy Dog story, named after a famous, oft-told joke, is similar. It has a set-up but then has lots of generally irrelevant information added. During the conveying of the information (the story), the listener tries to figure out how all this information will lead to a punchline and what that punchline will be. The punchline to a Shaggy Dog story is often nonsensical as well as being a surprise. Theoretically, the more tension created by the long story, the greater the laugh and release, but with Shaggy Dog stories (that do not always involve a dog), the response is often a groan. Here is an example. A man and a dog walk into a bar. The man sits on a bar stool and invites the dog to do the same. As soon as the dog jumps onto the stool the bartender says, “Get that dog outta here. We don’t allow no mangy mutts in here!” The man says, “But sir, this is a very special dog. He talks.” “Dogs don’t talk, mister. Get it and you outta my bar,” says the bartender. “Well, sir,” says the man, “I can prove he talks. In fact, I’d be willing to bet that he does. Whatta ya say, if he talks, you apologize to him and give me a free beer. If he doesn’t talk, then we will leave.” The bartender thinks this over a moment and then agrees saying, “This is against my better judgment, but go ahead. Make him talk.” The man turns to the dog who has been waiting patiently on the next stool and asks, “What is the opposite of smooth?” The dog says, “Ruff!” “See,” says the man, “He can talk.” “No, he can’t,” says the bartender, “That’s just him barking. Get outta here, both of ya.” “Ok. Wait, wait, wait,” says the man holding up his hand, “That wasn’t the best example. Let me try again, please.” The bartender growls and looks at the dog who wags his tail. “OK. You get one more chance for the dog to talk.” The man turns to the dog and asks, “What’s on top of a house?” The dog says “Ruff!” “See?” asks the man. The bartender who is getting angry says, “That’s just a bark again. You ain’t foolin’ no one. Get outta here before I call the cops!” The man says, “I can see your point. Another bad question. Let me ask one more to prove it to you.” The bartender looks at the man and then at the dog which has but its chin on the bar and stares lovingly at the bartender with its big, dark eyes. “OK. Last time. He better talk or me and my friends are gonna throw you out on the street!” The man turns to the dog again and asks, with an imploring look in his eyes, “Who is the greatest baseball player of all time?” The dog says, “Ruff!” The bartender comes around the bar and calls over his friends who pick up the man and the dog, carry them to the door, and toss them onto the sidewalk. The man, sits against the building stunned, rubbing a new bump on his head. The dog walks over to the man, gives the bump on his head three licks and says … “You think, maybe, I should have said DiMaggio?”"},{"prompt":"I need all the percentages mentioned in the following text and what each one stands for.

The nonprofit organization is based in Norfolk, Virginia. It opposes the exploitation of animals, including practices like animal testing, factory farming, and fur farming."},{"prompt":"Summarize these three paragraphs. Here is the source that I am using. Many cattle producers spend a large amount of money each year to control undesired plants (weeds and brush). Producers incur the primary cost by purchasing herbicides and hiring equipment and operators to clear brush and reclaim lands that have become unable to support cattle at an acceptable production level. In order for today's producers to have a chance at making an almighty dollar, every acre of ground capable of being productive must be used. Enter goats. Goats possess a unique characteristic that separates them from almost all other types of livestock. They would rather eat brush and weeds than grass because they are browsers, whereas cattle are grazers. Browse makes up approximately 60 percent of a goat's diet but only about 10 to 15 percent of a cow's. My family has a goatherd. I remember the day we first turned 200 goats out into a 30-acre \\"pasture\\" that was 25 percent impenetrable because of thick scrub oak and briars. The remaining 75 percent was overgrazed and had an alarming amount of weeds (forbs). The goats hit that wall of brush at a dead run and stripped every leaf off of every stem and branch. It amazed me. We had estimated that it would take three months for the herd to eat all of the brush, briars, and weeds. Six weeks later, those 30 acres looked like a golf course with a few sticks where the short brush used to be, and not a weed in sight. The goats had made a browse line in the taller brush, too (figure 1). It gets better. During the winter the goats wouldn't eat the hay we put out until they had cleaned up every dead leaf that had fallen off the trees. Simply amazing.","completion":"Controlling undesired plants by purchasing herbicides and hiring equipment operators is an expensive endeavor for cattle producers to maintain usable land for their herds. Surprisingly, goats are highly effective at removing these undesired plants because they eat predominantly brush and weeds. In one example, a pasture owner let a herd of 200 goats loose in an overrun and unproductive field. The goats cleared away the wall of brush and stripped leaves and branches at a much quicker rate than anticipated."},{"prompt":"Does Google have a random number generator?","completion":"Ablebits' Random Generator, which can be found on the Google Workspace Marketplace website, will add random sets of data to Google Sheets documents.

It could be due to a lack of security group permissions, strict firewall restrictions, or the instance might be deployed in a private subnet. 3.

Buuut if she's not, then it looks like I'll have a new pet! Can you help me brainstorm some names for her? I don't want them to be boring common pet names like Miss Kitty or something like that. Make it unique, interesting, and tailored to her. She's a medium-hair dilute tortoiseshell with an adorable terracotta nose. Her fur is mostly dusty grey, lighter on her chest, with dark grey stripes and patches of auburn. Her eyes are yellow-green and she is very, very affectionate but also very, very noisy.

However, assuming it doesn't, what do you think of the following names? • Gneiss -- Gneiss is a type of metamorphic rock characterized by light and dark grey stripes similar to the coat you described. Additionally, since this cat has a pleasant disposition, this name could form a cute pun on the word \\"nice.\\" • Cricket -- You mentioned this cat is especially vocal. Like her, crickets are known for producing a great deal of noise despite being diminutive creatures. • Vesta -- According to Roman mythology, Vesta is the goddess of hearth and home. Since this cat found your way to your home, this could make a fitting name to welcome her into your family. • Dust Bunny -- You could call her \\"Dust Bunny\\" as a reference to her dusty grey coat. It would also be an ironic play on the fact that she is not a bunny, but a cat. • Terra -- This cat's terracotta-colored nose could be the source for a clever name. It sounds like the common female name \\"Tara,\\" but references the earthy tones of her coloration. Do any of these catch your fancy, or would you like additional suggestions?"},{"prompt":"1. What was the name of the coach that led the Cardinals to win their championship in 1990? 2. How many points did Louisville score against Ball State? 3. How many games did Ball State lose in their regular season leading into the NCAA tournament? Use this article to answer the questions: After the departure of head coach Rick Majerus, Ball State responded under new coach Dick Hunsaker by having the best season in the school's history. This group of Cardinals became the first team in the Mid-American Conference history to win two consecutive MAC regular season conference championships as well as back-to-back conference tournament titles. The 1990 Ball State basketball team also became the first team in the MAC to reach the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament in its current format. The Cardinals lost in the Sweet 16 to the eventual national champions UNLV Runnin' Rebels, 69–67.[6] The team was led by many transfer players and two of Coach Hunsaker’s key transfers, starting forwards Paris McCurdy and Curtis Kidd, were high school teammates.[7] They both signed to play their college ball at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock. However, because of disciplinary reasons, the two had to find a new school. Former coach Rick Majerus gave them a second chance, and they came through. The two became the key assets to Ball States Sweet 16 run.[8] The Cardinals finished the regular season at 26-7 before heading to the NCAA tournament. The Cardinals were a 12 seed and began the tournament at the Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City. They upset the Oregon State Beavers in what was star point guard Gary Payton’s last game in college.[9] Ball State then had to play the Louisville Cardinals next. They ended up defeating Louisville late in the game by a final score of 62–60. Meanwhile, in Muncie, fans stormed the village (the center of Ball State's off campus social scene) after the win. Ball State advanced to face the top-seeded UNLV Runnin' Rebels. Ball State shut down one of the best offenses in college basketball history and had a chance to win it in the final seconds.[10] Down by two, the Cards made a deep pass to tie or take the lead but it was picked off.[11]","completion":"1.

Do these techniques require going to see a specialist like a massage therapist?","completion":"1. Deep Tissue Massage One of the most popular types of massage therapy, deep tissue massage uses firm pressure and slow movements to knead stress and pain out of muscles. It helps disperse scar tissue, improve blood flow, and promote a healthier immune system. 2. Swedish Massage One of the oldest types of massage therapy, Swedish massage uses a combination of steady, long strokes and friction movements in circular motions to move blood toward the heart for better circulation. 3. Hot Stone Massage Hot stone massage involves using flat stones, heated with hot water, to relieve muscle pain and relax muscle tension. The kneading motions around the stones are similar to Swedish massage. 4. Aromatherapy Massage Studies have shown significant links between human emotions and the olfactory senses, which aromatherapy massage utilizes. This type of massage uses natural essential oils to stimulate the senses and relax the mind while kneading motions relax the muscles. Some popular, relaxing scents employed in a typical aromatherapy massage session include lavender, lemon, peppermint, orange, or eucalyptus. 5. Trigger Point Massage There are pressure points all over your body that, when pressed in the right ways, can relieve pain and chronic health problems. Trigger point massage is the manipulation of your body’s pressure points to relieve specific issues, such as sinus congestion, stomach pain, and headaches. While it’s possible to find relief through massage at home, massage therapy is best practiced by specialists with knowledge of human anatomy. Massage therapists are well-versed in many different areas of massage, so they could be able to help you restore comfort to your mind and body in ways that at-home massage cannot."},{"prompt":"Artoo, please write a reimagining of the climactic Star Wars trench run from the perspective of the TIE pilot who screws up and hits Darth Vader’s fighter at the end.

Jace was known throughout the kingdom as the greatest spell caster that ever lived. Instead of using his power to fight or travel, he dedicated his life to teaching others who shared the passion and dedication to learn spellcasting as he did. Over the years, he trained countless apprentices, all from various backgrounds. No matter who or where they came from, Jace always treated them equally and with the same care they all deserved. Over the years, he proved to be a tough yet patient teacher of the magic arts. He knew everyone was capable but everyone learned at their own pace, so he adjusted to his students well. One day, a young girl named Anna who had lost her family had shown up, determined to channel her sorrow into something that could benefit others. Jace happily took her under his wing, and she proved to be an exceptional student. Anna spent countless hours, excelling and surpassing every other apprentice that Jace had taught. Eventually, as Jace was getting older over the next decade, he knew there was very little more to teach Anna. Anna was already becoming a far better wizard than Jace. He also was aware that his time was coming to an end. However, he felt an overwhelming joy in knowing his legacy would be passed on by his countless apprentices.

Fancy is the titular character of a series of short stories called Fancy the Forest Cat. I will provide you with some details I have about Fancy already, and then I will ask you what further details I would like to come up with for her based on what I have already come up with. The details I have so far are that Fancy is an adventurous black cat who lives with her owners in a house in the countryside. Her best friend is a Schnauzer named Buddy. Fancy and Buddy have owners who love them very much and they likewise love spending time with their owners. When their owners go to work, Fancy likes to go outside and spend time in the forest. Hence she is called Fancy the Forest Cat. She and Buddy can get into mischief together, and sometimes with other animal characters. Then she returns to the house at the end of each day when her owners come back home. She lives a very fun and nice life. The Fancy the Forest Cat short stories are about Fancy's adventures in the woods. In the world of Fancy the Forest Cat the animal characters have certain anthropomorphic qualities. They can't walk upright or wear clothes or drive cars like humans do, but they can talk out loud to one another (as in the animals understand one another, but the humans don't understand the animals). When communicating with one another, the animal can speak and express their thoughts to one another as humans do. The stories are family-friendly and suitable for children. They can have adventure and excitement but ultimately are meant to be fun and uplifting. Those are all the details have so far. The details/ideas that I would like inspiration from you are three primary things 1. What are two additional qualities that I can add for Fancy, like what are additional things she likes to do, one of which can help establish a theme for the stories overall? 2. What is one idea for something she doesn't like that can cause conflict or trouble in the story when she encounters this thing? 3. Can you make a pitch for a Fancy the Forest Cat short story? A four to five sentence summary would work best here. The purpose of the first two questions is to flesh out Fancy's character a bit more, and the purpose of the third question is to create a story idea for her character based on your answers to the first two questions (your ideas to the first two questions should impact the story idea for question three). Please compose your response in a numbered format to the three questions I have above, and also make sure your ideas will be compatible with the ideas I have for Fancy already.

There, you'll know you have things in common with the people and it'll be easy to strike up a conversation. 2. Use Apps: Some apps, like Bumble, offer a friendly setting where you can meet people on there and get chatting for a bit before meeting up. Make sure to always meet first in a public place and practice safety. 3. Volunteer: If you're passionate about a cause and have some spare time on your hands, consider volunteering for a local charity. You'll meet like-minded people that way. 4. Take Educational Classes: Educational classes are available in most places for adults, so look up one that appeals to you. You get to learn new skills while also meeting new people. 5. Use Social Media: Facebook usually has groups available for your city, and some forums are also location-specific. Becoming active on these can lead you to meet people in your city, though you should be careful and safe when meeting up, just like you would with apps too.

Talk about the health concerns of nanoparticles and that some studies suggest possible carcinogenic effects. Also mention other health related problems linked to it, and discuss the ingredients they usually have. Keep the response under 400 words.","completion":"Nanoparticles – used in cosmetics such as toothpaste, lipstick, or deodorant – are tiny particles over a thousand times thinner than the diameter of a human hair. For example, the pigments titanium oxide and zinc oxide are used in sunscreens and stay like a film on the skin to reflect sunlight. That all sounds positive at first, but the nanoparticles in cosmetics are controversial. Their effect on humans and the environment has not yet been adequately researched, and many meaningful studies have not been conducted. How tiny nanoparticles used in cosmetic products affect our health is completely unclear. Studies by the Federal Environment Agency on nanoparticles suggest a possible carcinogenic effect of some nanomaterials. These may include carbon nanotubes or titanium dioxide, which should be taken seriously. Many cosmetic products also contain nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles in deodorants have antibacterial properties. Other types of particles in creams and lotions help the skincare products get absorbed into the skin more easily. Toothpaste with nanoparticles fills the finest cracks in the teeth. Kohl pencils and mascaras have a longer shelf life, thanks to nanoparticles. Nanoparticles don't get through the skin if it is healthy. However, they can get into the blood via the respiratory tract. At the beginning of the year, scientists from the Center for Medical Biotechnology shared initial findings on how nanoparticles could influence our stomach and intestinal flora. According to this, nanoparticles can bind to harmful and beneficial bacteria, including probiotic germs. The immune system can recognize pathogenic bacteria more poorly when covered with nanoparticles. It promotes intestinal inflammation. Certain nanoparticles weaken the infectivity of the Helicobacter pylori germ involved in the development of gastric cancer."},{"prompt":"Can you please create a short list of five different cheap items that one should stockpile now before a potential future shortage occurs? Make sure that each item has a short description for it explaining the usefulness of the item; between 1-3 sentences should be enough.

No need to number each of the items","completion":"Superglue - Beyond its intended function, superglue offers many important uses as well: it can be used to help close open shallow wounds, patch holes in ripped tents or backpacks, or stop fraying rope or cording from unraveling further. Superglue is perhaps one of the most overlooked useful items that you can stock up on. Towels - Ordinary towels will get you dry fast after a bath or shower, or they can be used to help cover broken windows or leaks in your home as well. This is an example of a common household item that might not hurt to stock more of. Ziploc Bags - Ziploc bags will prove their usefulness for storing and organizing food you've just made or leftovers you'd like to save for later. You can use them for storing and organizing other small items as well. Furthermore, Ziploc bags are very cheap in bulk and can be found at most grocery and convenience stores. Firewood - You can sometimes find packs of firewood to buy for cheap at gas stations and convenience stores. It's a more convenient option for collecting firewood than going out to collect your own (in areas where you can legally do so). Propane Canisters - Do you have any items that are powered by propane, such as lamps, heaters, or outdoor cooking stoves?

This should be heavy on adjectives and make the reader feel like they have had an experience at this location.","completion":"The Grape Vine has been somewhat of a well-kept secret in Buena Park. It is away from the more congested routes of travel, and its unpretentious, unimposing structure means that it is often missed as foodies flock to the more trendy and glitzy locations closer to the beach. Don't let that stop you from enjoying an authentic Medditarriean dining experience. You can still feel the salty breeze from the ocean air as you sit on the covered patio draped with well-established grape vines to shade the intimate atmosphere. The staff is knowledgeable about which wines to pair with your meals and appetizers. True to the European dining experience, you never feel rushed through your meal to make room for other patrons. It is the perfect way to spend a leisurely afternoon. The grape leaves were bright and tangy, with a fresh lemon flavor that is unparalleled. The same goes for the tazkiki and hummus. There was an abundance of fresh, vibrant herbs that enhanced each dish and tasted as if they had been harvested moments before hitting the plates. Meat eaters will appreciate the tender classics like gyros and kabobs, prepared with grass-fed beef. While vegetarians can't find falafels with sprouted chickpeas and organic parsley anywhere else in this region. Walking into The Grape Vine is like walking into another time and place where you are family, and you are well fed as if attending a feast or celebration. The portions are generous, and the prices are modest. You will leave abundantly satisfied, hoping that the location doesn't become spoiled by tourists or the bar crowds that occupy the Beach Blvd. scene. This gem of a restaurant shines bright among all of the commercial dining options as a true 'Mom and Pop' location. The bread is scratch-made, and nothing is ever prepared from frozen products.

At his point in his development, he has many trials ahead, though the objective is clear. After an unfortunate stroke of hard luck, there is little in the way of the economy that he may use to prepare. The call is made for a desperate -- but not uncommon -- play. He purchases what little he can from the store and readies himself for the difficult journey. His spawn is favorable. Knife in hand, he takes the Western path from his spawn down into the shaded upper tunnels. This is where he must face his first hurdle -- one that all too often ends in a deadly outcome. The narrow corridor leading to the B-Site lies ahead. As expected, an incendiary grenade is lobbed in creating a dangerous hazard for him and his team. Luckily, he prepared for this. Dropping a smoke while he runs, the smoke dissipates the inferno -- creating safe passage at the cost of visibility. He bursts through the smoke from the end of the corridor. On the site now, he scans for enemies. Detecting one in the Car position and one in the Window position, he relays this information to his team using short specialized barks frequently referred to as, \\"calls.\\" He trades damage with the enemy from Window before dispatching him with his less-than-optimal tools. The enemy at Car is dealt with by his teammates, though not without suffering casualties themselves. The T-player sets the fuse, and the countdown timer to success begins.

Hawaii is one of the United States’ most popular vacation destinations, and here are a few reasons why: • The weather is beautiful all year. Hawaii is separated into eight islands, and each one experiences its weather patterns. However, the weather is predominantly sunny and beautiful on every island. Hawaiian winters rarely dip below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, even though that’s considered the rainy season. Summer temperatures average between 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. • There’s a focus on the history and culture of the islands.

William Congreve (1670-1729) was an English playwright, and one of the most sophisticated exponent of the comedy of manners during the Restoration era. Congreve wrote five plays before he was 30. His first, The Old Bachelor, was an enormous success at Drury Lane in 1693, in a production starring Thomas Betterton and Mrs Bracegirdle. According to Congreve he wrote the play to amuse himself during a convalescence. The Double Dealer (1694) was not so well received but in 1695 he produced another hit, Love for Love (again with Betterton and Mrs Bracegirdle), to open the new Lincoln's Inns Fields Theatre. Its success secured his reputation and earned him a share in the theatre. His promise to write at least one play a year for the theatre of which he was now a part owner, was unfortunately not fulfilled. Congreve's only tragedy, The Mourning Bride (1697), was his most popular work during his lifetime but is now rarely seen. It starred Mrs Bracegirdle as Almeria, a part that became much coveted by tragic actresses. In 1700 The Way of the World, - a highly sophisticated and complex work now considered his masterpiece - met with a cool reception. This failure, together with his continued discomfort at having been attacked in Jeremy Collier's influential pamphlet A Short View of the Profaneness and Immorality of the English Stage (1698), persuaded him to retire. (Congreve had replied to Collier with little effect in Amendments of Mr Collier's False and Imperfect Citations.) Voltaire later visited him and accused him of wasting his genius. Congreve told him he wished to be visited as a gentleman, not as an author. To this Voltaire replied that if Mr Congreve were only a gentleman, he would not have bothered to call upon him. Congreve was by all accounts a warm man who won the love and respect of his many friends. John Dryden called him the equal of Shakespeare, Alexander Pope dedicated his translation of the Iliad to him in 1715, and John Gay called him an \\"unreproachful man.\\" When he died he left nearly all of his £10,000 estate to his mistress, Henrietta, the second Duchess of Marlborough, who arranged for his burial in Westminster Abbey.","completion":"English playwright, William Congreve (1670-1729), was the most sophisticated writer of the comedy of manners.

What did I do today that was so special, you might ask? For starters, today was my grandmother's 90th birthday. I went out with her to get breakfast and brought her a small present and a silly hat for her to wear at breakfast that said \\"Birthday Girl!\\" We were laughing so hard, and it was nice to be able to have another birthday breakfast with my grandmother. After breakfast, I went to play tennis with my good friend, Charlene. I hadn't seen Charlene in over 6 months because she's a dentist and was traveling throughout South America to provide free dental work to those in need. We caught up, had some laughs, and we played several games of tennis. I needed some quality time with my good friend; it was perfect! To top off an already spectacular day, that evening was my grandmother's birthday dinner, where our whole family was there to celebrate her 90th year on this earth. We ate a great home-cooked meal, potluck style, where everyone brought dishes to be shared. There was so much good food! We sang songs, ate cake, and my favorite part was reminiscing and catching up with loved ones. What an amazing, wonderful day this was!"},{"prompt":"Write a poem about the experience of becoming rich and realizing that all the money in the world cannot bring happiness.

I had everything money could buy, Mansions and yachts, a plane to fly, Fine dining, expensive clothes, and jewels, Yet in my grand chateau, I felt like a fool. For a while, I reveled in my grandeur, But soon, the emptiness caught me for sure, My soul was empty, my life was vain, Amidst all the riches I felt insane. I realized all my wealth was for naught, An endless void in which I was caught, The glitter and glamour, just a fleeting joy, In my own heart, I was still a little boy. The more I had, the more I wanted, I was stuck in a cycle, completely haunted, The more I earned the more I spent, The never-ending chase became a torment. I gave away all my belongings, And discovered the true source of meaningful things, It was love, care, and human touch, That mattered the most and meant very much. Materialism left me hollow, It offered nothing true or real to follow, But love, patience, and smiles, Made my heart beat for miles and miles. Like a phoenix, from ashes I rose, And chose a different path, I chose to propose A way of living, beyond wealth and glory, Where happiness resided and told its story. The road was long but fulfilling, Where flowers bloomed, and birds were singing, I cherished life's simple pleasures, And discovered the true joy that abounds beyond treasures."},{"prompt":"Which of these movie titles are misspelt?

Opinion Age should not be a determining factor in elections Kathleen Parker got it wrong in her May 21 op-ed, “America’s gerontocracy is getting too old.” There are about 56 million Americans age 65 or older, and they’re not all slurping apple sauce from straws and “teetering on the brink of non compos mentis.” And, yes, they too deserve representatives in a functional democracy. As a 19-year-old college student, I support older professionals in any field, including politics, who defy ageism by refusing to step aside — as long as they can fulfill their duties. Age should be no disqualifier when considering an individual’s ability. Whether someone can carry out their job must be judged solely on a person-to-person basis. Excluding an entire demographic is wrong, even if that demographic represents no particular sex, race, class or religion. Whether it’s criticizing President Biden for his stutter (more than 3 million Americans stutter) or Martha Stewart for her glamour, older adults battle rampant ageism, especially in the job market. Let’s face it: We all grow old — at least those of us who are lucky enough. If we’re just going to dismiss the notion that wisdom comes with experience, then Ms. Parker should step down and hand her job over to one of the many fledgling young columnists out there who would be thrilled to relieve her of her position, me among them.

At best, it seems disrespectful.\\" While you may take offense at the tone of my article, I stand by my contention that we must discuss it. As for myself, I am not ready to give my position yet, but I am confident that readers like you will keep me honest.

She was so very glad they were here with her, helping her pave the way toward her throne. Though one had been born into wealth and privilege and the other born into a second-class, pigeonholed status where people with her skin color rarely raised themselves out of struggling mightily every day to meet their basic needs, something bigger brought them to equal footing. It was grief. Loss. A year ago, after a battle with a slow but incurable illness, Naveen's mother lost the man she'd been married to for nearly 40 years. There seemed to be a quiet understanding between the two women, sisters in heartache. Not that is was so dark as all that. Upon learning of his father's illness, Tiana and Naveen did something she'd never imagined. They'd sold the restaurant, packed up their New Orleans home, and asked the nanny that looked after their two daughters to accompany them across the sea. The girls, Lottie and Elodie, were doing fine. They'd barely understood that they were princesses, and all this was a grand adventure. Tiana felt a pinch in her stomach anytime she looked at Lottie. Her oldest, her girl that now would grow to one day be queen. It was better than being barred from half of life in the bayou, but it was far from a normal life. \\"You're worrying, darling,\\" her mother said, pulling Tiana from her misgivings. \\"This is Naveen's birthright dear, and I have a surprise for you,\\" the queen said. \\"Follow me.\\" Tiana followed the queen mother down the winding, tapestried stone walls of the castle. She'd never get used to how sprawling the palace was, how many rooms there were. This walk wasn't comforting her. That was until the queen mother pulled open a door and said, \\"Oh, I hope you like it!\\" \\"Oh,\\" Tiana said at first, words beyond her. There before her was a fully equipped, top-of-the-line kitchen. Every tool she could imagine and some she'd never laid eyes on before gleamed under the bright lights. Rolling pins stood sentinel beside marble slabs meant to evenly cool chocolate. And, best of all, in pride of place, stood a framed picture of her father."},{"prompt":"I need some good hobby suggestions that are inexpensive and easy to try. I'm open to both indoor and outdoor hobbies, but I do want a mix of both - I live in a cold place and will need a hobby during the winter, too!","completion":"No problem, here are a few great hobby ideas for you to try that are both affordable and easy to start. 1. Blogging - While there are a lot of people who blog professionally as their main source of income, there are also some who blog just for fun. You can start a blog on any topic you are interested in. You can make it humorous, or write about a serious topic you are passionate about. You are not pressured to follow a particular schedule or format and you may end up connecting with others who share you same interests through your blog. 2. Reading - Grabbing a book and reading for hours may already be a favorite pastime for many people, but if you haven't picked up a book in a while and you are looking for a good way to pass the time, reading is an excellent option. Studies show that just a few minutes of reading something you enjoy can lower your stress levels by as much as 60 percent. 3. Learning a new language - There are a few hobbies out there that can be as useful in today's world as learning a new language. And if you are good enough at it, you could even find ways to use your new skill in your professional life as well. Or you could simply enjoy being able to communicate with locals on your next vacation. 4. Journaling - While keeping a diary or journal may seem like something you would only do in your younger years, journaling has been known to be extremely therapeutic and helpful. Trends such as hand lettering or bullet journaling have made keeping a journal these days a fun and functional work of art and there are many tutorials out there that can show you ways to journal more effectively. 5. Staying Informed on Current Events - Yes, staying up to date on current news and world happenings can be a hobby. If you would like to stay in the know but do not want to get bogged down by negativity, you can choose to have free daily briefs sent to your email or smartphone device. These quick and shortened blurbs of information will provide you with your daily news stories without all the unnecessary drama. 6. Gardening - Few hobbies are as rewarding as gardening. You get to spend time outdoors in the fresh air, care for and nurture your plants and watch them grow into thriving flowers or fruits and vegetables for you to enjoy. All it takes to get started are a few seeds soil, fertilizers, and a few basic gardening tools. If you are new to gardening, growing a few herbs or flowers in a pot is a great way to start. 7. Hiking - Hiking is another great hobby that costs nothing and will benefit you in more ways than one. If you love nature and being outdoors, you will love going out and exploring hiking trails at your local park or other fun destinations. Hiking can help you mentally by reducing stress while helping you physically at the same time. You can find simple, low-impact hiking trails for beginners or expert trails with inclines and rugged terrain if you are up to the challenge. 8. Camping - Another excellent hobby for anyone who loves the great outdoors is camping. You don't have to go to extremes and spend a lot of money to enjoy camping. You can go with the basic supplies and have just as much, if not more, fun than those who go camping in large exquisite tents or RVs."},{"prompt":"Can you please write a short story about Batman and the Joker?

He had talked to the police commissioner already but they kept the light on as a warning to criminals: Batman was here. But in reality, petty criminals had nothing to fear tonight; he was busy with a more important target. The Joker was holed up in an apartment building with a number of hostages. He had supposedly rigged the building with his signature laughing gas. They'd gotten as many civilians out as possible, but there were still far too many at risk. Batman looked down at the building, planning his attack. The Joker would be on one of the top floors so that he could escape via the roof if needed. But Batman didn't plan to give him the chance. He pulled out his bat drone. \\"Scan the building, find the Joker,\\" he said, releasing the drone into the air. It flew around the building, capturing infrared imaging of each floor. \\"There, the top floor. It has to be him.\\" On the screen, Batman saw four bodies, three of which were sat on their knees as if they were bound with rope or wire. The fourth must be the Joker, the hostages providing him extra protection. Batman crept toward the edge of the building and fired his zipline gun across. He grabbed the wire and lept, sliding across the zipline. About 15 yards from the building he let go and unfurled his cape, gliding across the rest of the gap. He aimed carefully, ducked his head to protect his eyes, and smashed through the window. He rolled to his feet and quickly fired a Batarang, pinning the Joker's shirt to the wall behind him. \\"Well, it's about time, Bats.

It provides pinpoint accurate information about molecular distributions in biological structures, and analysis with this technique can even provide the absolute number of proteins present in biological systems. It is a powerful high-resolution imagining technique that has been shown to have the potential to be an extremely useful complementary method for experiments, utilizing conventional light and electron microscopy. This technique provides direct experimental feedback for modeling the complexity of biological interactions. Localization microscopy works on the principle that the diffraction barrier (the resolution limit of light waves) can be bypassed by photoswitching, photoactivation, or photoconversion of individual fluorophores, which are attached to the structure of interest.","completion":"Localization microscopy is a new technique that helps us understand how cells work at a microscopic level. It gives us accurate information about where molecules are in biological structures. Using this technique, we can even count the number of proteins in a cell.

He never trademarked the flag so that it could be freely reproduced and flown around San Francisco and the world. He is also known as \\"the gay Betsy Ross.\\" Baker is also known for the drag ensembles that he sewed himself and that he wore to many protests and celebrations beginning in the 1970s. In a June 12, 2018 interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Charley Beal, one of Baker's friends and the creative projects manager for the Baker estate, said \\"Gilbert knew the power of fashion in a 'Devil Wears Prada' kind of way.

Ki is also known as Chinese \\"chi,\\" Hawaiian \\"akua.\\" God, or spiritual essence. Ki is a principal concept in certain schools of Aikido. It is the life force that flows through every living thing, and it comes from the universe in which we live. Imagine electricity coming out of a generator. Turning on the generator starts the engine, which, in turn, creates the electricity needed to power electrical items or appliances. Like the generator, humans act as generators for Ki, but the only way to properly allow the human body to conduct the universal electricity is to follow a set of principles that will prime the body to receive Ki. These principles are designed to unify the mind and body so they become one. Here are the principles to ensure the mind and body are connected, and Ki can flow through you: 1. Keep One Point 2. Relax completely 3. Keep weight underside 4. Extend Ki The second and third principles are of the body, while the first and fourth principles are of the mind. Keeping One Point is done by putting your mind (your concentration) on a point two inches below your navel, where the body's center of gravity resides. Relaxing completely entails relaxing the entire body until there is no tension within, but not falling into \\"dead\\" relaxation - it should be a feeling of calm readiness. Keeping weight underside means that when you relax your body, the weight of your body naturally goes underside; when you stand, your weight goes downward toward your legs so that you are rooted firmly and calmly to the ground. Extending Ki entails imagining that water is springing forth from your One Point through your body like a powerful water hose, and the water shooting out from your entire body toward infinity. These concepts can help in daily life by grounding you and making you more receptive to the energy of the universe."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this poem into a short story of at least 3 paragraphs.

She had been in the rescue center for so long while her leg healed from the trap she had fallen into. Now she could explore her new habitat and that's just what she was intent on doing. Eventually, the deer slowed down again and after a while, she found herself in a beautiful place. There were trees, and there was a lake where she stopped for a refreshing drink. Surrounding the lake was the lovely glow of bright yellow flowers. As far as she could see there were flowers and with the wind blowing they even seemed to be doing a little dance.

The head is elongated but the ears are relatively small. The front paws are large and are used like paddles for swimming while the hind legs trail behind. The nose, and the skin underneath the white fur, are black. The soles of the feet have small papillae and vacuoles like suction cups to make them less likely to slip on the ice. The polar bear is the largest land carnivore alive in the world today. Adult males weigh from 400 to 600 kilograms (880 to 1,320 pounds) and occasionally exceed 800 kilograms (1,760 pounds). Females are about half the size of male s and normally weigh 200 to 300 kilograms (440 to 660 pounds). Immediately before entering the maternity den in the fall, the weight of a pregnant adult female can exceed 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) because of the enormous amount of stored fat. Adult m ales measure 240 to 260 centimeters (95 to 105 inches) and females 190 to 210 centimeters (75 to 85 inches). At birth, cubs weigh 600 to 700 grams (1 pound 3 ounces to 1 pound 6 ounces).","completion":"The polar bear is very easy to spot because it has unique, fluffy white fur. The polar bear has a neck that is longer than other kinds of bears. They have a long head with ears that are pretty small. Their two front paws are very big which makes them great for swimming in the sea. Even though their fur is white, their noses and the skin under their fur is black. The bottom part of their feet have small, soft bumps on them. This means they are less likely to fall over when they are walking on slippery surfaces like ice. The polar bear is the biggest meat-eating animal that lives on land in the world today. The fully grown male polar bears weigh between 880 to 1,320 pounds. They can even be as big as 1,760 pounds.

Can you explain this “720 rule” I keep hearing about?","completion":"The 720 rule for anodization is most often used as a quick way to estimate the time it will take to create an anodized layer of the thickness you want. It’s an algebra formula, so you can also rearrange it to tell you how thick your layer will be after a specified time. To use this formula you need to know two of the three variables listed here: - Desired anodization layer thickness - Current density - Anodization time The current density can itself be determined by dividing the anodization machine’s current output by your part’s surface area. It should come out in units of Amps per square foot. The desired thickness of the anodized layer is measured in mils (one mil is equal to 1/1000 inch or 0.001 inches) Most users employ the 720 rule to decide how long to leave their part in the anodization bath. If that’s your goal, the equation will look like: - Time (minutes) = 720 * desired thickness (mils) / current density (A/sq ft) The 720 value in this equation is a known constant, so it’s the same each time you use the equation. There are limitations to this equation. It only applies to parts made of aluminum (and a few exotic aluminum alloys have enough other elements that the rule doesn’t work). It also assumes that your anodization setup is a so-called constant-current style. A constant-current device must ramp up the voltage as the anodization layer gets thicker so that the electrical current that reaches the underlying surface remains constant. Constant-current devices are the most common in the industry. If those qualifications are met, the 720 rule should give you good estimations of how much time parts need to spend in the anodization bath."},{"prompt":"You are a wizard who has been invited to a magical tournament that tests your skills and knowledge.

Children who are exposed to violence in movies, tv shows, and video games are more likely to engage in these behaviors themselves. A 2010 analytic review of 136 studies, published in Psychological Bulletin, showed that exposure to violent media is associated with increased aggression, decreased empathy, and decreased prosocial behavior, all of which are risk factors for conduct disorder. 2. The causes of conduct disorder. There has been much research on the role of both genetics and environment in conduct disorder. In a 2018 article published in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, the authors review research on gene-environment interactions. They conclude that there are a number of genes that have been linked to conduct disorder, but the effects of these genes aren't always clear. They also note that various environmental factors have been linked to conduct disorder. 3. The prognosis of children with conduct disorder.

As such, it should be comfortable and cozy, which means that it also needs to be well-organized to store the necessities and the little extras that give a big rig the home touch. There are a number of ways to achieve this. Organization comes in many forms, but you'll be sure to find the following items invaluable: * Command hooks: They are removable and can be relocated to a position that works best in the cab; they're useful for hanging caps, belts, and towels to dry. * Over-the-door shoe storage: The pockets are perfect for toiletries, spare water bottles or soda cans, and all types of snack storage. * Plastic storage containers: These take the place of your house bedroom's dresser drawers. You can also get appropriately sized containers for extra supplies, such as paper and pens. * Shower caddies: Not only can these be used for grabbing quickly to take to the showers, but they can hold your eating utensils, spices, and a variety of kitchen items. * Spring-tension curtain or shower curtain rods: There is usually some unused vertical space in a semi, so these can create extra space for hanging clothes and jackets, or you can even use them to hang a curtain to hide what's being stored on an unused upper bunk. * Back-of-the-seat organizers: You really can't go wrong with extra pockets everywhere! * Sticker labels: Be sure to label everything so that you're not constantly searching for what you need. Be sure that you're taking a piece of home with you on the road. A cell phone and a laptop are musts. Use comfortable bedding, and even invest in a good mattress to ensure you stay well-rested. Pictures of your family are a nice touch, and many truckers even travel with a furry companion.

Slappy the Dummy, from Goosebumps. Slappy is arguably the most memorable figure from RL Stine's horror novels for young readers, as well as their accompanying adaptations. He is the antagonist of the Night of the Living Dummy saga as well as the official mascot of the Goosebumps franchise as a whole. 4. Talky Tina, from The Twilight Zone. This doll and the episode in which she first appeared are often cited as the birth of \\"doll horror\\" and likely had an impact on many of the other haunted doll stories that came after. 5. Brahms, from The Boy. While most doll horror tends to frighten audiences by having dolls move around and perform unnatural tasks, this film creates an ominous tone through the characters' insistence that the doll, Brahms, is alive despite the visual evidence to the contrary."},{"prompt":"Now I would like a few non-art and nonhistory museums in Portland, OR","completion":"Of course!

How could i be more mindful and would it be helpful?","completion":"Being mindful is to be fully engaged and present in the moment. This can be very hard for some but there are quite a few things you can do to gradually improve. Living in the moment is an expression commonly used, but people often brush off the real meaning. Living in the moment is to enjoy the things you are doing, to actively know what you are doing, and to take it all in. You may find yourself spacing out sometimes, but try your best to focus on the things around you. The best exercise to practice mindfulness is meditation. Meditation is not only sitting down with your legs crossed as often thought, but meditation is the practice of focus. Calming yourself, and controlling your thoughts and breathing, allows you to become more aware. You can also do this while walking. This will help you to become more focused on the things you are doing. Overall, being mindful does not just happen. You have to actively do things in order to feel the effects.

The flight came nearly two years after founder Richard Branson beat fellow billionaire and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and rocket company Blue Origin into space. Bezos ended up flying nine days later from West Texas and Blue Origin has since launched several passenger trips. Federal aviation authorities banned Virgin Galactic launches after Branson’s flight to investigate a mishap.","completion":"This news article belongs in the Science category."},{"prompt":"Summarize what is relevant to me about the horntail snail if I live in Miami, Florida. Horntail Snail On September 30, 2020, FDACS positively identified the presence of the horntail snail (Macrochlamys indica) in Miami-Dade County. A program to survey, control and eradicate this federally regulated pest was immediately put into action to stop the snail's spread. This is the first time this snail has been found in the United States. Description The horntail snail is a well-known pest in India and feeds on a wide variety of commercial crops, including lettuce, beans, yams, and chrysanthemums. It is a voracious feeder, most active at night and after rainfall. It has a delicate amber-colored shell that is about the size of a dime. The snail prefers cool, damp locations, so it may be found under pots or in moist soil. During dry, hot weather, it may burrow in the ground.","completion":"The horntail snail was first seen in Miami-Dade County in September 2020. There is a program now in place to survey, control, and eradicate this snail from the area because it is invasive. The snail is the size of a dime and is tan in color.

Currently, towns like mine are severely lacking in public parks, which are crucial for the well-being and development of both children and adults. The public parks provide opportunities for people to stay active, spend time outdoors in nature, and interact with their communities.

It doesn’t make financial sense to buy them all uniforms for a short term pop-up, but I do want a cohesive look for the staff so that customers know who to ask For help. The restaurant is neither formal nor super casual, and I need a uniform that works for the full gender spectrum.","completion":"I can help with that! Here are some basic dress code ideas that could work to give your employees a cohesive look: -Basic black: Wear black from head to toe. -Black and white: Wear black pants or shorts with a white top. -Canadian tuxedo: Though people sometimes mock this as a civilian fashion choice, pairing a denim top with blue jeans can be a stylish look. -Primary colors: Pair blue jeans with red, yellow, or blue tee shirts. -Head-to-toe color: Maybe your restaurant’s interior prominently features a color that isn’t black, white, or primary, like teal or orange. You can have your employees wear a top in this color or dress in it from head to toe. -Business casual: Your employees could all wear polo shirts and khaki bottoms for a unified but diverse look. -Standardized pattern: Your employees could all wear plaid flannel tops, gingham prints, tie-dye, stripes, polka dots, paisley, or floral patterns. They could also wear more whimsical patterns if they’re on brand for your restaurant, such as Hawaiian shirts for tropical island cuisine or ugly holiday sweaters for an eatery serving comfort food in the last months of the year. -Signature aprons: It may not be sensible to purchase full uniforms for your staff, but custom aprons could make a less expensive and more practical alternative. They would not need to be tailored to each employee’s individual size, so the staff members could share from a collective pool of clean aprons in much the same way they’d share resources like napkins and trays. You'd just need to pay to have the aprons laundered in bulk every few days. -Standardized accessory: You could allow employees to wear whatever they’re most comfortable in, but have everyone wear the same accessory to make them easy for patrons to pick out of a crowd. This accessory could be a colorful hat, scarf, or necktie, among other options, but for visibility to customers, it’s a good idea to choose something worn above waist level. -Theme costume: If your restaurant’s menu lends itself to a specific theme—for example, a prohibition-era speakeasy, a Mexican cantina, or a 1950s-style diner—you could ask your staff to dress in relevant costumes of their own choosing. Bear in mind that this does place a burden of responsibility on staff that could be quite costly; on the other hand, your employees might really enjoy putting their own costumes together and view it as a perk of the job."},{"prompt":"Write a short story about an old man named Fred, he is very grumpy.

Make this geared toward someone who has absolutely no experience with horses.","completion":"- Lift the horse's foot - Make sure to raise the horse's hoof in a way that is comfortable and natural, and make sure the horse is aware of your presence beforehand, so it is not startled. Put your hand on the horse's leg, and run your hand down until you reach the tendon above the ankle. When the horse feels this, it will shift its weight to the other three legs. Once you have the foot raised, try resting it between your knees, with the sole facing up toward you. - Remove the existing shoe - Use a clinch cutter to straighten the nails holding the old shoe on, then use a pair of metal pull-offs to remove the shoe from the hoof. This can also be done with a flat screwdriver. Wiggle the tool in a rocking motion until it is loose enough to pull off by hand. - Clean the hoof - Make sure to clean away any dirt and debris to prevent it from being trapped between the hoof and the new shoe. Use a hoof pick to remove dirt or manure, using downward strokes from heel to toe. Follow up with a wire brush to remove any remaining debris. Be careful of the fleshy area here because it is very sensitive. - Remove the excess hoof - Use a hoof knife to remove the excess flaky part of the bottom of the hoof. The outer layer will be hard and dark, and once cut, the hoof underneath will be softer and whiter, similar to a human's toenail. Make sure not to cut too deep, and not to cut yourself. - Trim excess hoof wall - The hoof wall is the edge of the hoof. It should only extend about 3 inches from the hairline of the hoof. If it is longer than this, trim it back and make sure to cut it straight and level so it will sit flush with the ground when standing. - Use a rasp for leveling - This is the last step before applying a new shoe. Use a rasp and gently file any uneven areas so that the hoof is smooth and level. Use a knife to cut away a slight bevel away from the hoof wall to prevent the sole of the shoe from coming in contact with the soft part of the foot."},{"prompt":"Turn this paragraph into a bulleted list of questions with answers.

The man, Stanlee Fazi, 41, of Louisa, Va., pleaded guilty in federal court to trafficking turtles from July 2017 to June 2020. During that time, he collected Eastern box turtles — which have bright yellow or orange markings on their cocoa-colored shells — and shipped them to buyers in the United States. Many of the animals were then sold to people in Hong Kong and China, where the illegal pet turtle trade is booming, prosecutors said. Turtle populations there are in decline because of their use in the pet trade, in Asian folk medicines and as food. Mr. Fazi admitted that he had bound the turtles in socks and shipped them via FedEx from Fredericksburg, Va., making about 12,700 in the scheme, the Justice Department said in a news release. He will be sentenced in July and faces up to five years in prison and a 250,000 fine. ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story Mr. Fazi’s lawyer, Edward J. Ungvarsky, said in a statement that his client “loves turtles and publicly sold a small number of turtles that he found over several years to fellow aficionados here in the United States.” “He never intended for any of them to be sent to Asia,” Mr. Ungvarsky added. Virginia law prohibits the taking and selling of any turtle species from the wild; it is a federal crime to violate state wildlife laws. Dig deeper into the moment.

Mr. Fazi’s case is the latest to catch the attention of federal authorities who have been investigating a growing illegal, international pet trade worsened by the pandemic after people who were spending more time at home sought exotic pets, particularly species easy to keep and smuggle.

ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story Indeed, many species of turtles in Asia are endangered, and climate change and habitat destruction have made their futures even more dire, according to the University of Hawaii. Conservationists have described the phenomenon as the “Asian turtle crisis.” But the shipments of Eastern box turtles to Asia have contributed to the species’ decline in the United States. The Eastern box turtles are also an invasive species in Asia and may spread disease there. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service investigation found that at least 1,500 native turtles — including wood turtles, spotted turtles and Eastern box turtles — were illegally smuggled to Asia between June 2017 and December 2018. The illegal pet trade in the United States has led some to believe that the underground market is an easy way to make money, said Crawford Allan of the World Wildlife Fund, an expert on international wildlife trafficking and trade. The premise, he said, seems simple: You find turtles outside, collect them and sell them online. ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story “What we have found is that it is so easy to put things on social media without detection,” Mr. Allan said in an interview. Mr. Fazi deployed that social media strategy in his scheme, according to prosecutors. Court records show that on July 26, 2017, he posted on Facebook Marketplace’s “Virginia Reptile Classifieds” that he was “looking for any and all box turtles. Message me and let me know what you have.” Such open queries are typical in the illegal turtle trade, Mr. Allan said, because people “can avoid detection” easily. Sometimes they change keywords with emojis or with code words when trying to communicate in a sale, he said. Facebook, which prohibits such transactions on its site, is one of the major platforms that is being taken advantage of in the exotic pet trade, Mr. Allan said. ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story “It’s so difficult to tell the difference between somebody just showing a nature video” or someone trying to sell an exotic animal by being clever in their messaging, Mr. Allan said. He noted, though, that detection is improving because of more sophisticated algorithms. Some of Mr. Fazi’s most financially lucrative sales involved “screamer” Eastern box turtles, which are highly desired because of their vibrant coloration. They can have streaks of red and yellow on shells dazzled with dots and bright red eyes. Mr. Fazi offered to sell a pair of screamers for 400, according to prosecutors. In one message to a customer that appeared in court records, Mr. Fazi boasted that he had a lot of screamers in his possession. “I will always supply you with easterns man,” Mr. Fazi wrote. “No need to go anywhere else.\\"","completion":"None of the information requested can be found or given."},{"prompt":"I'd like an acrostic poem based on the word \\"goat\\" with a barnyard theme.","completion":"Grass and hay and oats Or little grains of corn Are great for sheep and goats That live inside a barn."},{"prompt":"Which fruit do you think this short rhyme is describing?

As you become more comfortable with this style of breathing, you can try closing your mouth and inhaling and exhaling through your nose. - Sama Vritti Pranayama, or box breathing, involves inhaling for a count of 4, holding for 4, exhaling for 4, and again holding for 4. This cycle can be repeated for a few minutes. It should help you feel calm and relaxed. - Dirgha pranayama, commonly referred to as three-part breath, involves quickly stopping your inhalations and exhalations with short pauses.

Here is the article I am referencing: Warren Buffett, chairman, and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, praised the government's intervention in recent bank failures, saying on Saturday it averted what could have become an even bigger crisis. Yet he said the U.S. banking system had become overly complicated — and that he was not surprised that the banks had failed. He said he'd been selling bank stocks, first at the start of the pandemic and more recently over the past six months as banks increasingly face mismanagement and respond to bad incentives. \\"The American public doesn’t understand their banking system — and some people in Congress don’t understand it anymore than I understand it,\\" Buffett said. Speaking during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, about the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, Buffett said he thought the government did the right thing in stepping in to guarantee bank deposits above the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guarantee of 250,000. “It would have been catastrophic,” Buffett said of a situation in which the government didn’t act. He added that refusing to guarantee all SVB deposits risked a “run on every bank in the country” and, by extension, a threat to the global financial system. Berkshire Hathaway, the Omaha-based conglomerate that owns and invests in companies ranging from Dairy Queen to Geico, has substantial investments in the largest banks in the country. As of the end of 2022, Buffett’s investments included a 13% stake in Bank of America, 3.2% stake in Bank of New York Mellon, 2.8% stake in Citigroup and 0.5% stake in U.S. Bancorp. The banking industry has been rattled by higher interest rates, which squeezed banks unprepared for the sharp drop in the value of its interest rate-sensitive assets. Buffett said he was worried about how easy bank runs had become. \\"If people think deposits aren’t sticky anymore, you’re living in a different era,\\" he said, adding technology has made it so that \\"you could have a run in a few seconds.\\" A new poll from Gallup found that nearly half of Americans say they are now worried about the safety of their deposits, the highest share since the global financial crisis of 2008. Yet even as he worried about the ease with which additional bank runs could occur — and recounted how his father lost his job in 1931 as the result of a bank run — Buffett said the U.S. government actions should have demonstrated that concerns about deposit safety were unfounded. “Here we are in 2023, and we actually see the FDIC pay off 100 cents on the dollar to everybody, or making it available to all demand deposits,” Buffett said. The banking crisis episode has led to heightened scrutiny on the commercial real estate sector, where telework arrangements and soaring borrowing costs are raising concerns about banks that lend to the sector. “The hollowing out of the downtowns in the United States and elsewhere in the world is going to be quite significant and quite unpleasant,” said Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who added that Berkshire itself is not actively exposed to commercial real estate.","completion":"1.

On the island was a group of citizens who were once members of large cities and countries, but came here to practice solitude from the increasing craziness of the outside world. Here, on this little island, the population of 100 souls could live out their lives in relative peace. Self-sufficiency is always the main concern in a closed-off society. Considering this society was also an island that was both physically and intentionally cut off from civilization, the people of this community needed to become (if they were not already) proficient in live-savings skills: first-aid, food hunting and gathering, and making shelters and clothing. The members of the island came here as a group almost 30 years ago with just the proverbial shirts on their backs, but those items of clothing were long gone to the elements. Now, they wore a mixture of leaf-based and animal hide tunics and trousers, and footwear made from the rubber of nearby trees. An article published in Time Magazine caused a lot of controversy in the town; specifically, outsiders began flocking to the remote island to become members of this small society. As for the community members, they saw nothing but trouble and hassle and began feeling society's grasp wrapping around them again. They escaped the problems of the outside world, but the outside world decided to follow them to the remotest parts of it. In retaliation, the community members began closing up their businesses, removing signage and retreating into their hand-built shelters. They would not welcome these newcomers, opting instead for an icy reception. The unofficial mayor of the community, Sal Hardwick, greeted visitors with the following phrase designed to make them rethink their choice: \\"Leave now. No one will come to your aid, and nothing here belongs to you.\\" While some individuals heeded the warning, others were made to understand via the village bouncers physically removing them by force, usually into the ocean, where some remain to this day for lack of swimming skills."},{"prompt":"I would like to try making homemade cat food.

The worst of this was that King Leopold III of Belgium surrendered to the Germans on May 28 without warning his allies, exposing the entire flank of the Allied forces to German panzer groups.[44] Following the conquest of the Low Countries, Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway, beginning on April 9, 1940. Norway was strategically important because of its sea routes which supplied crucial Swedish ore to the Nazi war machine. Norway held on for a few crucial weeks, but Denmark surrendered after only four days.[45][46] Sweden was the only Scandinavian country to successfully maintain its neutrality throughout the war, with occasional breaches of neutrality in favor of both Germany and the Western Allies.[47]","completion":"9, 10, 28, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 88, 600, 1939, 1940"},{"prompt":"Write an acrostic poem using the word \\"seashells.\\" Keep it related to shells and beach-themed.","completion":"Sun-baked totems of the ocean Each one is unique and beautiful Adorning sandy shores, a delightful treasure Sandy secret-keepers Homes for under-sea creatures, providing protection and comfort Even the broken ones are special Left behind by the tides Lovely colors and endless patterns Special keepsakes that store memories"},{"prompt":"What are some fun games to play at a bachelor party that don't involve drinking?","completion":"Try out these ideas! 1.

The 172 has come in a few different variants over the years, but all told, well over 44,000 of them have been sold. There are a few appealing characteristics that have made the Skyhawk popular. One of the biggest factors is its simplicity. Compared to many aircraft, the Cessna 172 is simple to fly and maintain. It is regularly used by pilot training schools specifically for that reason. Compared to many of its competitors, the Cessna's high wing can be advantageous. Most competing aircraft like the Piper Cherokee have low-mounted wings which limit visibility below the cockpit and make the cabin harder to get into and out of. The Skyhawk's high wing limits upward visibility but makes it easier for pilots to see the ground and runway. Until recent years, the 172 was also among the most affordable planes to buy. Unfortunately for Cessna, a downturn in demand has meant fewer Skyhawks are coming off the line now and their per-airframe price is rising accordingly.

Write an email to Kentucky Fried Chicken requesting in a logical fashion that they switch to selling a different meat.","completion":"To whom it may concern: I am writing in protest of decades of your company's sole focus on one protein group: chicken. When Colonel Sanders started your company, he clearly had a bias against fowl. What else could explain his decision to single out chicken protein while overlooking valuable other meats like beef and pork from his restaurant's menu? Seafood is also an excellent protein source. Some consider snails a delicacy! The truth of the matter is that the public perception of chickens has been changing in recent years. You can now find beautiful specimens of my species adorning dishtowels, metal signs, and wall decor. Some clearly enlightened people adopt chickens as part of their families, even dressing them in trendy outfits and accessories. Elaborate coop designs are available online for owners who want to keep their highly-esteemed chickens living a life of luxury. When making decisions about which species to feature on your menu, KFC is not taking into account the generous contributions cows make to the proper fertilization of the soil. Protecting the environment is a top-of-mind issue for many consumers, and just imagine the goodwill it could garner from your company switching to farming cows! And let's take a look at pork. Pigs will eat almost any kind of food waste you provide. They aren't particular. You could give them the prior day's leftover mashed potatoes and coleslaw and they'd be, well, as happy as pigs! Pork lends itself to some tasty menu variations, like pickled pigs' feet and pig snouts. In fact, doesn't \\"Kentucky Fried Pig Snouts\\" have a ring to it? Plus, there's an added benefit to switching to pig protein: dogs love to eat pigs' ears, and that would offer you an avenue into a completely new market. Other proteins have positive selling points, too. Fish can be farmed in ponds capable of containing many fish in a relatively small footprint of real estate. Dig the pond as deep as you'd like. And think about how little space it would take to raise snails! In closing, I believe Kentucky Fried Chicken needs to revisit its antiquated business practice of selling chicken. There are other wonderful protein substitutes available that are more earth-friendly, offer added revenue streams, and offer a more efficient use of space.

The reason for their extinction is not necessarily known, as it is difficult for scientists to determine the exact cause of an extinction that happened pre-historically. However, scientists do have some theories about why the Neanderthals went extinct. The main theory is that a combination of climate change and increased competition from other species brought the Neanderthals to their end. Neanderthals were highly specialized for cold environments. While these specializations were advantageous during the Ice Age, they are thought to have caused Neanderthals to be unfit for the warming environment that they began to face about 45,000 years ago. Homo Sapiens, on the other hand, had much more adaptability to these changes and were fierce competition for vital resources at the time. This is considered to be the main theory behind Neanderthal extinction. However, scientists have offered more ideas on the subject. Our understanding of the topic may change as scientists continue to study human evolution and discover more information."},{"prompt":"When did George Washington die?","completion":"George Washington, the First President of the United States, died due to a throat infection on December 14, 1799."},{"prompt":"Tell me three fun date ideas that are low-budget for a young married couple.

It is a former mining town that nearly went extinct before switching to being an outdoor recreation site. It has mountain biking trails complete with bike shuttles for your convenience and perfect for snowboarding in the winter, and the two rivers that connect nearby give plenty of opportunities for swimming, white water rafting, and paddling. - Tucson, Arizona - This site is similar to the crowded Sedona mountains and has over a thousand trails for hiking, mountain biking, and climbing. The nearby town also has plenty of restaurants, shops, and museums. - Naples, Florida - Key West is a very popular place to visit in Florida for those who want to have a marine adventure, but you can do some of the same things in Naples.

Poppy seeds don’t have nearly enough opiates to intoxicate you. But because drug tests are exquisitely sensitive, consuming certain poppy seed food products can lead to positive urine drug test results for opiates – specifically for morphine, codeine or both. Under most circumstances, opiate concentrations in the urine are too low to produce a positive test result. But certain food products – and it’s generally impossible to know which ones, because opiate content does not appear on food labels – contain enough opiates to produce positive test results. Moreover, because of overlap in opiate concentrations and morphine-to-codeine ratios, it can sometimes be challenging to distinguish test results that are due to the consumption of poppy seeds from those that are due to the use of opiate drugs. This is not a problem with most workplace drug testing. Test results are reviewed by a specially trained physician called a medical review officer. Unless the physician finds evidence of unauthorized opiate use, such as needle marks or signs of opiate intoxication or withdrawal, even relatively high concentrations of opiates in the urine that produce positive test results are generally ruled to be negative. It turns out, though, that drug testing in the military is different, and poppy seeds pose potential problems. One such problem, as highlighted in recent news reports, concerns service members who test positive for codeine and assert a “poppy seed defense.” They are still regarded as having taken codeine, sometimes with serious consequences, such as a disciplinary action or discharge from the service.","completion":"Drug tests are extremely sensitive and consuming certain poppy seed foods can actually lead to positive urine drug tests. Other foods can set off a drug test, but it's nearly impossible to tell which ones will. During most workplace drug tests, a trained physician will list the results as negative unless they see other evidence of opiate use such as needle marks, intoxication, or very high concentrations of opiates in the system. The military on the other hand may take serious disciplinary action if they find any opioids in a drug test, even if the culprit is only poppy seed foods. To answer the question, Yes, poppy seeds can set off a drug test, but it generally does not result in a positive test unless they are being ultra strict."},{"prompt":"I need an ahk script that accepts a user inputted integer, multiplies it by 42, subtracts 8, and checks if the result is even.

Ability to pay on credit. Sometimes you don't have enough money to pay for something, but you really need it. A credit card lets you purchase a product as soon as you want and then pay off the balance over time. Certain situations can be highly beneficial, such as expensive emergencies or wanting to spread the costs of a large purchase over time. 2. Most accepted payment method. Retailers almost universally accept credit cards. This means you can carry one card around instead of constantly withdrawing cash. Visa and Mastercard are the largest payment processors for credit cards, and you will find that they are accepted almost everywhere in the world. This is an excellent benefit if you travel a lot and don't want to keep track of currencies. 3. Interest-free cash withdrawals. Some credit cards allow users to withdraw large amounts of cash without paying interest for up to 45 days. This can be extremely useful in emergencies. 4. Reward points. Credit cards often give users reward points for using their cards. This means you get extra value on your purchases simply by using a credit card. Certain credit cards offer specific rewards for specific spending categories giving users a bonus for spending money, for example, on travel. These rewards are often limitless, which gives customers an excellent opportunity to get maximum value from the card. 5. Insurance. Credit cards offer significant security measures such as insurance. Having personal accident coverage and travel insurance just for having a credit card is a massive benefit that entices credit card users. As well as this, credit cards also offer a sense of security as users are often able to get refunds on transactions that they did not receive a product or in instances where the product was not as described. 6. Make travel easy. Some credit cards give you great travel benefits. As well as not worrying about organizing local currency, some credit cards offer discounts on flights, dining out, and hotels. Credit cards sometimes offer reward bonuses for money spent on travel. Sometimes, your credit card can give you priority access to airport lounges and other areas. 7. Discount and cashback. Similar to rewards, credit cards offer users exceptional discounts for spending at preferred stores and sometimes offer money back as cashback. Money for free is a great benefit of using a credit card. 8. Improve your credit score. If you want to buy a house or secure a loan, you must have a strong credit history and rating. A credit card improves your credit score by showing you can be trusted to repay your borrowed money. Along with smaller bills like phone and tv subscriptions, this is the best way to build a credit history. 9. Safety. Not having to carry cash around can make you feel a lot safer. A credit card allows you to carry just one card and have far more money than cash. 10. Keep track of expenses. If you regularly use cash to pay for things, tracking your expenses can be difficult without much effort. Using a credit card will mean receiving monthly statements outlining every transaction. This makes it much easier to see where your money is spent and make informed decisions regarding your spending."},{"prompt":"I need you to help me write a hard letter to my dad, asking him for a 600 loan until I pay him back next Friday, to help with tuition and food.

The truth is, I'm in a bit of a pickle and could use your help. As you know, the inflation rate has increased substantially, and my school tuition went up. Not to mention, the obscene gas prices that have forced me to use public transportation to get to school and work. Im eating ramen noodles, and meatless spaghetti every day just to get by. Honestly, I'm embarrassed to admit how bad it's been. Recently, I started working a 2nd job as a waitress to help pay for some of the added bills, but I won't receive my first check for another week. Would you be willing to loan me 600 until next Friday to cover food and tuition? I hate asking you for money, but times are tough, and I need help. If you don't have it to loan, no pressure.

Six rhyming verses should be sufficient.","completion":"Oh no, oh no! What am I to do? I woke up feeling awful, I’ve come down with the flu. My nose is super stuffy, I’m sneezing and I’m wheezing, The coughing’s seeming endless, With difficulty breathing. Fever’s made me chilly, But also hot as well, Legs are shaking, body’s aching, Reality’s hard to tell. Nauseous and dizzy, I’m stuck here in my bed, Sleep is near impossible, I’ll read a book instead. I’m sweating in my pj’s, Should I go take a bath? I bet that it would feel so great, A break from this flu’s wrath. Feeling a bit better, I guess I’ll try some food, Ginger ale and crackers, Oh wow, does that sound good."},{"prompt":"It is raining outside, and my kids are bored. Give me five ideas for what the kids and I can do on this dreary day.","completion":"Ok, here are some fun ideas to try for a rainy day: - Board or card games. Just about every household has a small stack of board games, or a deck of cards around. These games can be a fun and mentally stimulating way to pass the time, and a good deal of these games can be played with many age groups. Sorry, Monopoly, and Chutes and Ladders are classics, while UNO and Yahtzee provide a little something different. Don’t forget about tabletop role-playing games for older family members! - Arts and crafts. There are lots of things that can be made with regular household objects. Get some paper, school glue, and some scissors and make collages. Or get some pipe cleaners and make stick figures. Find some googly eyes and glue them to a clothespin. Use your imagination; you are bound to find some old items that can be repurposed for a fun piece of art. - Build a blanket and pillow fort. This is great for the little ones - they seem to love places to play hide and seek and you can get creative with bed pillows, couch throw pillows, blankets, sheets, and whatever else you can find. You can make this into a fun way to watch a movie or binge some family TV shows. - Have a talent show. Sing a song, make up a silly dance, or tell some dad jokes. Take turns and see who can come up with the craziest character or most original dance. Add some music and turn it into a fun karaoke party! - Make some tasty treats. Nothing beats rainy fun than eating some treats that you made for yourself. Cookies and brownies are easy staples that the kids can help with, while older folk may experiment with more decadent treats like chocolate mousse or a no-bake cheesecake. There’s a little something for everyone here, and you can be as healthy or indulgent as you like."},{"prompt":"Extract and list the top five ranked countries in order from the following table: Medal table Rank Nation Gold Silver Bronze Total 1 East Germany (GDR) 11 7 9 27 2 United States (USA) 6 8 8 22 3 Soviet Union (URS) 4 4 10 18 4 Poland (POL) 3 2 0 5 5 Finland (FIN) 2 2 0 4 6 Cuba (CUB) 2 1 0 3 7 West Germany (FRG) 1 4 4 9 8 Bulgaria (BUL) 1 2 1 4 9 Jamaica (JAM) 1 1 0 2 New Zealand (NZL) 1 1 0 2 11 France (FRA) 1 0 0 1 Hungary (HUN) 1 0 0 1 Mexico (MEX) 1 0 0 1 Sweden (SWE) 1 0 0 1 Trinidad and Tobago (TRI) 1 0 0 1 16 Belgium (BEL) 0 2 1 3 17 Canada (CAN) 0 1 0 1 Italy (ITA) 0 1 0 1 Portugal (POR) 0 1 0 1 20 Brazil (BRA) 0 0 1 1 Czechoslovakia (TCH) 0 0 1 1 Great Britain (GBR) 0 0 1 1 Romania (ROU)","completion":"1) East Germany 2) United States 3) Soviet Union 4) Poland 5) Finland"},{"prompt":"Create a function that, when given a coefficient matrix of an Ordinary Differential Equation, finds the Eigen vector and Eigen value.","completion":"Absolutely!

The Owl always takes her sleep during the day. Then after sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows rise slowly through the wood, out she comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow tree. Now her weird \\"hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo\\" echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat. Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and for window. \\"Get away from here, sir,\\" she said to the Grasshopper. \\"Have you no manners? You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!\\" But the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak. Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune. The wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved. So she laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to him. \\"Well sir,\\" she said, \\"if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before he sings to the high gods. Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me. I know it will make you sing like Apollo himself.\\" The foolish Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl's flattering words. Up he jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as he was near enough so the old Owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him and ate him up.","completion":"A grumpy old owl was awoken by a grasshopper playing a song. The Owl told the grasshopper to leave, but the grasshopper refused. The Owl then changed her approached and instead was kind and invited the grasshopper up to the tree to share a bottle of wine.

Here is the article I am talking about: Official weather bureau of the United States, founded on February 9, 1870, and charged with providing weather, hydrologic, and climate forecasts and warnings for the United States, its possessions, and its marine and freshwater approaches. Such weather forecasts and warnings are produced to help safeguard the lives and property of American citizens from the dangers of severe weather, as well as to protect the national economy from weather-related disruptions. The NWS, which is a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is considered the official source of the United States concerning life-threatening weather, complementing local and regional reports made by television and radio broadcasting stations and Internet sources. The NWS maintains an integrated network of more than 100 regional and field offices across the United States and its possessions. Forecasts are derived from weather and climate data collected from a multitude of sources, including satellites, aircraft, weather balloons, and ground-level remote sensing equipment (such as Doppler weather radar). Traditional instrumentation (such as thermometers, barometers, and rain gauges), however, is also used to collect weather data in the vicinity of each office. The NWS began with the Signal Service Corps of the U.S. Army. In 1870 U.S. Pres. Ulysses S. Grant signed a resolution allowing the secretary of war to set up a national weather warning service. The original purpose of the service was to facilitate the collection of weather data from military installations located across the country and warn locations along the Great Lakes and marine coasts of the approach of storms. In the early days of the service, weather information was relayed by telegraph to Washington, D.C. This office later sent forecast information out to local Signal Service offices, which were subsequently distributed to rural post offices, railroad stations, and newspaper offices for dissemination to the general public. As part of the Organic Act of 1890, which was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by Pres. Benjamin Harrison, the weather service was renamed the United States Weather Bureau (USWB) and was placed under civilian control within the Department of Agriculture. The responsibilities of weather forecasting, warning, and observation were officially transferred from the Signal Service Corps to the USWB on July 1, 1891. The USWB was made part of the Department of Commerce in 1940, and it became part of the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) within the Department of Commerce in 1965. ESSA and several other offices were restructured into the newly created NOAA on October 3, 1970, and the USWB became the National Weather Service on October 9.","completion":"The United States Weather Bureau became the National Weather Service and part of NOAA on October 9, 1970."},{"prompt":"Write a story plot about a younger and older sister.","completion":"1.

I am so nervous about doing something wrong to harm the pup! Give me the tip and then elaborate with 2-4 sentences.","completion":"- Research the breed of your pup. Regardless of whether you choose a breeder or get your dog through adoption from an animal shelter, each breed of dog has its own set of personality traits and needs. The breed you choose should match your time, financial situation, and lifestyle. In cases of adoption from animal shelters, dogs will be mixed breeds, but they have a dominant breed in their DNA. Genetic tests can help you discover more about that pup’s breed and its specific needs. - Your home should be dog proofed! Just like you would if there were children in your home, you need to proof your home against accidents and curious explorations. In a new home, most dogs will find things to break or chew on because they haven’t learned your boundaries. Electrical cords, shoes, books, and children’s toys should be put away to avoid having broken or chewed belongings. - Be patient with your dog when they come home for the first time. Your dog isn’t used to your home yet, so give them space and patience. Show them their bed, toys, food, and water bowls, then give them a little space to become acquainted with their surroundings. - Schedule a veterinarian appointment for vaccinations and the good health of your canine. Up-to-date vaccines and routine vet appointments help keep your pup healthy throughout its life. Schedule their first veterinarian appointment within a week or two of bringing them home.

Take an authoritative and informative tone to encourage readers to free themselves from worries and to trust in their destiny.","completion":"This world has so much to offer, and we are takers. We take and take and take, never feeling full. It is the greed that keeps us wanting more. But we can only keep what’s ours, and the rest of it will slip away from our hands just like quicksand. There is no shame in saying you are happy with what you have because, in one way, growth also means making peace with your destiny, accepting it, and owning it entirely. People will tempt you to try to change your situation or try harder so you could go against the power of fate. But that, my friend, is stupidity. No one can ever go against the power of fate. No matter how big of a star you are or a CEO of a big organization, if you are meant to lose everything one day, you will. You cannot put barriers in the way of destiny because it never asks for permission. “Patience is not the ability to wait. Patience is to be calm no matter what happens, constantly take action to turn it into positive growth opportunities, and have faith to believe that it will all work out in the end while you are waiting.” It’s not wrong to accept what is meant for you and leave behind what your heart wishes for. Let that sink in. Read it every day as a dose of positivity, and keep moving forward. It takes a brave heart to accept the unknown, but once you welcome whatever comes your way with open arms, you win. The idea of growth itself makes us want to change and do better. But because we have arrived in this world with a destiny already written for us, it is in our best interests to have faith and not become selfish. Ask yourself one more time why you must tire yourself by thinking of all the buts and ifs. Why not just do your job by trying hard enough and then leave everything to your fate? No one deserves to be called a loser just because he didn’t become someone people wanted him to be. Give yourself to your destiny completely.

Changing ONE person's life is significant, but your art could change several lives, a dozen, a hundred, or thousands--and you might not even realize it. 3. If you give up now, you don't know what could happen. Who knows how many people in human history gave up right when they were about to succeed? Every second you spend creating art is a success story because it means you didn't give up. A final word: picking up another job in the meantime doesn't make you a failure.

This will be concerning my pay.","completion":"Here are five tips to use when negotiating your pay. 1. Know your worth. Before entering negotiations regarding your pay, you must know what you are worth. Knowing what you are worth to a company will give you a base for negotiations. It can be tough to see what you are worth to your company, but luckily, you can use sites like glassdoor.com and payscale.com to get a better idea of what people in similar roles and companies to you do earn. This knowledge will mean you can confidently suggest a number in line with the market rate. Offering a rate identical to others in your field will allow you to have confidence that the company will not be able to find someone better without at least paying an equal rate. Hiring new staff is often tedious and not cost-effective, so forcing your employer into this decision can work in your favor. 2. Use good timing. Timing is everything in negotiations, which is never more true than in salary negotiations. Utilizing good timing can be the difference between a successful salary negotiation and an awkward conversation with your boss. Try to initiate salary negotiations while the company is doing well and you are being seen to impact that success substantially. A salesman who isn't hitting targets regularly would be ill-advised to open negotiations regarding salary. It may be that they can get a higher wage but unlikely to be sufficient if they don't have the data to back up their claimed performances. If you've just completed a profitable project and been a key player, it's probably a great time to strike while the iron is hot and ask for a pay rise. 3. Be realistic. It is necessary to know your worth and understand your value to a company, but remaining realistic is also pivotal. If you aim for the stars and ask for 50% more than you are worth, you can expect your employer to grow frustrated and unsympathetic to your request. The better tactic is to have a number in mind you would like, then add a small % to it so that you can work down to your ideal number. This will allow your employer some wiggle room to negotiate and feel they are not being played. It is essential to back your realistic request up with why you deserve it and what others are getting. 4. Don't ask too often. As stated above, alienating and frustrating your employer is not a good idea. If you do this, you risk no negotiations and just a simple no. This will leave you in no better position than you were before. That is precisely why it is essential not to ask too frequently for a pay rise. Think of a similar situation in the car when a child asks the parents are we there yet over and over. The parents become frustrated and eventually will stop answering. The same will happen with your employer. They will revert to a standard no answer if you continuously ask for something. Instead, be sure to research what you are worth and strike while the iron is hot, as we described in point 2. 5. Don't be afraid to ask. It seems silly to put this point straight after point 4. However, the fact is valid and should be discussed. While asking too often is not advised, not asking at all will probably get you nowhere. While this can't be said for all companies, most are reluctant to hand out pay raises regularly and will wait until they are asked or forced. That's why it is crucial that if you feel you deserve a pay rise and the circumstances dictate one, you stand up for yourself and ask. The worst thing they can say is no. If you don't think you deserve a pay raise, that's fine. Don't ask till you do. But if you have been stuck at the same rate for years and are integral to our company's operations, then speak up and ask for your worth."},{"prompt":"I need an ahk script that will search three inputs to see if the word sphinx is it.

He would make sandcastles, splash in the water, and paddle on his boogey board until he could ride the waves back to shore. One day, he swam far out to sea. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a huge fin in the water. Shark! he thought. No, it was bigger than a shark-- this was a megalodon! Before he could swim away, the shark's head popped out of the water. \\"Excuse me,\\" the megalodon said. \\"I have something stuck in my teeth. Could you help me?\\" The shark opened his enormous jaw, and Evan saw seaweed tangled around one of the shark's teeth.

After he ate something, it either came out in one of two directions, and he didn't want that to go any farther. He had to find a way back up the shark's throat. Then, he got an idea. Evan ticked the sides of the megalodon's stomach harder and harder. The walls shook as the shark laughed. A wave of vomit crashed over Evan, carried him up the megalodon's throat, and tossed him into the ocean. He looked at his sticky arms, covered in throw-up. \\"Yuck,\\" he said. \\"Sorry about that,\\" said the shark. \\"That's OK,\\" replied Evan. \\"Hope you feel better.\\" The shark nodded. \\"Next time, I'll try to get the seaweed out on my own, though.

Litecoin (LTC) - Litecoin is a bitcoin alternative that's gotten quite popular. Litecoin has a Bitcoin-compatible API and a quick-running blockchain. You can mine Litecoin using the Scrypt algorithm which is memory and compute-intensive. It also can't be mined by Bitcoin's API chips. 2. Ethereum (ETH) - Russian-founded Ethereum is an application platform that puts storage resources across the internet, and it's similar to peer-to-peer streaming services. The resources on Ethereum are paid by Ether, which is the cryptocurrency the platform is named after. Ethereum allows for contracts built into its software DNA, and the currency pays out when conditions are met. You can mine Ether with Ethereum's resources, and it is possible for the cryptocurrency to go through inflation. 3. Ripple (XRP) - The Ripple cryptocurrency is controlled by Ripple Labs Inc, which is connected to the banking industry. Ripple has been taken on by large banking companies such as Bank of America and UPS, and it's used in securing transactions internationally. Ripple comes with low transaction fees and a high speed. 4. Zcash (Zec) - Bitcoin transactions are on public record, but Zcash is a private currency. It has a \\"zero-knowledge\\" security implementation, which makes it a safe option. It also works with a blockchain mechanism that doesn't link old and current transactions. Zcash can be mined with a gaming GPU. 5. Dash (DASH) - The name dash comes from the words digital and cash, and it used to be called Xcoin and then Darkcoin. This litecoin works with almost instant transaction speeds, and its money transfers are private. Dash isn't actually governed by humans, and its contract is actually encoded into its program."},{"prompt":"Give me 7 tips for writing an awesome CV.","completion":"Of course. Below, I have written seven tips for writing a standout CV. 1. Start strong. Start your CV by listing your best achievements to date. Highlight your skills and experience, and just champion yourself. The goal of a CV is to convince a potential employer you are the right fit for them, so don't be shy and tell them exactly why your skills and experience will assist their company. If you don't get this bit right, it is unlikely recruiters will get much further into your CV. 2. Emphasize past results rather than responsibilities. When detailing your work history, try to avoid discussing what you were responsible for and instead highlight your actual results. It is far more meaningful for someone to see results rather than try to infer what you have achieved through roles and responsibilities. It sounds better to say, \\"I ensured the completion of 5 major projects within my time at the company,\\" rather than, \\"In my role, I was responsible for major projects.\\" 3. Customise. One CV does not fit all jobs. Try to tailor your CV to the job you are applying for, and bring to the fore the experiences that suit the role and company you are applying to. Research the company to understand who they are, then tailor your CV to match its ethos and culture. 4. Highlight growth and change. Change is good, and growth is even better. If you have been promoted or changed roles at a previous company, mention that. Recruiters will take that as you are versatile and willing to learn. This will give them affirmation from the actions of your previous employer that you were both competent and proactive. 5. Demonstrate your network. Showcase that if you have a large network and are well connected. Employers will see that as an opportunity to hire you and get the added bonus of your well-established network as a resource. If you are hired, they get two for the price of one. 6. Show industry insight. It doesn't hurt to give a small opinion if you are applying to an industry that's currently topical or experiencing changes. Doing this shows you are current, in the know, and committed to your career in this industry. You don't have to give an opinion. You could forecast a change you foresee and mention how you see this impacting a role. 7. Use powerful words. A CV is extremely important in grabbing a recruiter's attention.

I'm Caffeine Carl. I love caffeine. Caffeine is love. Caffeine is life! There are so many forms of it. I can't get enough! Sometimes it makes me all dizzy and such. But man, the rush of being fueled is like nothing else! Let's start with the basics and move up from there. Hahah. I get giddy thinking about all the forms of caffeine. Let me make another pot, and we'll get started! • Trace amounts (0-10mg): decaffeinated coffee or tea. These will still have a tiny bit, but maybe 5% of the caffeine of a cup's worth. I never drink this stuff! • Baby mode (10-20mg): chocolate and tea. Both of them contain some morsels of caffeine, it's true. Those sensitive to the stuff should probably stay away. Who knew a Hershey's bar could give you a buzz? • Startin' to feel it (20-60mg): black teas, chai, and a few others. Not as strong as the old bean juice, but might do something for ya! This is the kind of stuff I drink when winding down for the day. Haha! • The real stuff (70-150mg): coffee! Pretty much a baseline of measurement for caffeine with 80-120mg of caffeine per cup. It's about the same in serving amounts for espresso, iced coffee, Americanos, and lattes. • Harder. Stronger (150-230mg): stronger coffee! Coffee, such as the way Starbucks brews it, is made with less water and will have more caffeine. Also, cold brews (the ones you sit in the fridge overnight) will be around this range too. Yum! • Kickin' and Screamin'! (250-400mg): the strongest energy drinks will reach this. For example, a 24 oz big can of Monster will have 240mg! A 16 oz can of Bang Energy is 300mg as well! Now that'll be a rush! • Carl's Choice (400-500mg+): Kaffn8 Liquified Caffeine contains 300 mg in only 1 oz of drink! Take 1-2 of these and you'll be livin' fast! It probably will cause you some nausea, headache, or dizziness. But I love livin' life like that, baby!

Be sure to mention Dressage and why it is important in the English riding culture. make sure it's a numbered list. Keep the text under 300 words.","completion":"That will not be a problem; here are the following types of competitions in the English type: 1. Show Jumping: Show jumping requires a lot of precision, agility, speed, and athleticism. With a clear goal, the rider takes the hours through multiple obstacles in a specific pattern. Faults are considered when a pole is dismantled, the rider goes off from the way, or if the rider takes too much time on the course than the required allocated time. 2. Eventing: This particular form of English riding consists of three different event types. The first is Dressage to show how well the horse has received discipline. The second is Jumping, to prove the performance of precision and speed. While the third is cross-country, which demonstrates the agility and endurance of the horse and rider. 3. Dressage: Dressage is a specific form of English riding that trains the horse to learn discipline. This discipline shows how well the horse responds to the rider's commands and how much control the rider has over the horse's movements. This is a highly communicative type of riding between the rider and horse to ensure a tight connection. 4. Saddle Seat: Saddle Seat is meant to showcase a horse's various gaits, with focused high-stepping abilities. For this type of English, a close-contact saddle is needed for most disciplines with its lightweight and high-performance qualities. Additionally, the horse and rider in this competition are proven, similar to Dressage, in how well they communicate through body language."},{"prompt":"write me a funny tweet about the cast of vanderpump rules. make sure to reference cheating somehow. make sure to put no more than 2 hashtags in this tweet. make it less than 200 characters.","completion":"The cast of Vanderpump Rules is the perfect storm of trashy reality TV: excessive drinking, over-the-top drama, and enough cheating to make even Jerry Springer scream.

Hard-earned experience brings the ability to write good content with few errors, quickly, and then it’s just a matter of applying the proper discipline and structure. One of the least-appreciated things about mental work is that you simply can’t do it for eight-hour stretches like physical work. Instead of trying to stretch out work time, the most important thing to do is maximize the quality of your writing time. Setting a chair and table on the balcony and leaving phones and other devices out of sight is a great start to immersing yourself in your work. Commit to highly productive stretches of work for 60-90 minutes, then take a break, move around, and give your mind and eyes a rest.

I own a tech company and am trying to get more brand awareness.","completion":"Here are eight things to consider when identifying your target audience. 1. Analyze current customers. If you are in a position where you have existing customers, then a good first step is to identify traits and characteristics among them. Think about the demographic they belong to and why they may be purchasing products or services from you already. You may already have data regarding your current customer's ages, locations, and vocations. These are all valuable metrics to track and interpret when defining your target audience. 2. Market research. Conducting market research is a valuable process. By conducting market research, you can identify areas in which you may be able to grow an audience or a blind spot where your services could be of real value. Looking into your competitors can provide great insights into what works and doesn't and where services like yours perform well. Knowing what others offer gives you an advantage when creating a unique selling point that sets you apart. 3. Industry trends. Keeping your finger on the pulse and identifying what changes are occurring within your industry allows you to tailor content and services in a way that provides real value. This leads on from market research slightly and is another way of ensuring you stay informed concerning your customers' expectations and desires. This will allow you to provide them with a constant value. 4. Distinguish benefits from features. Benefits and features are fundamentally different things. It is important to clarify this to your target audience. It is excellent that you have a feature or product that can help them in some way, but it's even better if you can explain the practical benefit of the feature. Take, for example, a product that improves productivity. Emphasizing productivity improvement and what that means is more important than highlighting the actual feature that does the work. People are more interested in what you will enable them to do rather than how you will do it. 5. Spy on your competition. Just as important as your customers are your competitors. Keep an eye on what they are doing and the content they are producing. What could be working for them, and what could you do to improve what they have? This is an easy way to gain inspiration and see what's not being offered. This will allow you to fill in the gaps and potentially convert customers to you and your services. If your competition produces content about something you are not, this may mean they have researched and identified a weak spot. Now you can do your own research and improve on what they have done. 6. Who isn't your target audience? Knowing who your target audience is made much easier if you can identify exactly who it isn't. Who won't benefit from what you are offering or take an interest in what you are saying? By analyzing these questions, you can reduce your audience to specifics and tailor your services to those likely to benefit from and purchase them. Doing this will give you more time to concentrate on those that matter. 7. Be objective. Making assumptions can lead to alienating some of your customer base. This can be avoided by posting content that leads by facts more than anything else. By being objective, you show your customers you can be trusted and only care about black and white. This should help to foster a sense of trust in you and your products. 8. Go niche. It may seem like going to a niche would limit your customers, and while that may be true to an extent, you shouldn't underestimate how many people are in the world. And also how being a leading figure in a super niche topic can grow your audience quickly and lead you to be the go-to person in said niche. Also, it is worth remembering that while your niche may mean fewer customers or audiences, it also means less competition."},{"prompt":"Should this home improvement task be classified as painting or paving? How To Paint a Driveway A fresh coat of paint not only gives your driveway a facelift, but also helps prolong its life by slowing down chipping and cracking due to weather exposure. To properly paint a concrete driveway, you must first ensure that it is completely cleared and clean. Next, fill any cracks, if applicable, so you can paint over them and give the driveway a nice even coat. Last but not least, make sure to use thick masonry paint that will withstand the expansion and contraction of the driveway.

Here is the story: An old miser lived in a house with a garden. The miser hid his gold coins in a pit under some stones in the garden. Every day, before going to bed, the miser went to the stones where he hid the gold and counted the coins. He continued this routine every day, but not once did he spend the gold he saved. One day, a thief who knew the old miser’s routine, waited for the old man to go back into his house. After it was dark, the thief went to the hiding place and took the gold. The next day, the old miser found that his treasure was missing and started crying loudly. His neighbor heard the miser’s cries and inquired about what happened. On learning what happened, the neighbor asked, “Why didn’t you save the money inside the house? It would’ve been easier to access the money when you had to buy something!” “Buy?”, said the miser. “I never used the gold to buy anything. I was never going to spend it.” On hearing this, the neighbor threw a stone into the pit and said, “If that is the case, save the stone. It is as worthless as the gold you have lost”. Choices for the moral of the story: 1. A possession's only worth is what it is used for. 2. Stones are as valuable as gold. 3. It is good to hide your valuables outside. 4. Never trust your neighbor.","completion":"1. A possession's only worth is what it is used for."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this technical review in a way that a layman can understand. You no longer have to spend more than 500 to get a video card using NVIDIA's current Ada Lovelace architecture. The company is launching the GeForce RTX 4060 series, which will start at 299. The flagship RTX 4060 Ti will start at 399 with 8GB of RAM when it arrives on May 24th — a full 200 less than the base 4070. It's pitched as a direct successor to the similarly-priced RTX 3060 Ti and 2060 Super, and aimed at gamers who are more interested in high frame rates at 1080p than a high resolution. The RTX 4060 Ti is a noticeable step down from the 4070 with 4,352 CUDA cores (versus 5,888) and a 128-bit memory interface (versus 192-bit). It's a mixed bag versus its predecessor. While the 3060 Ti has more cores and a much wider 256-bit interface, Ada, DLSS 3 upscaling and a clock speed boost (2.3GHz base compared to the old card's 1.4GHz) theoretically help the 4060 Ti deliver more actual computing power, particularly for ray tracing and tensor-based tasks. It uses less power, too, with an \\"average gaming power\\" of 140W instead of the 3060 Ti's 197W. NVIDIA claims a roughly 15 percent average performance increase at 1080p over the 3060 Ti in games that don't use DLSS 3's frame generation, and 70 percent for those that do. You'll unsurprisingly get high 1080p frame rates in competitive titles like Counter-Strike 2 (330FPS) and Overwatch 2 (260FPS).","completion":"NVIDIA is releasing video cards using the newest technologies and priced under 500. There are many different models in the GeForce RTX 4060 series, like the 4060 Ti which is the strongest one in the lineup. These graphic cards improve on older models and are very useful for video game enthusiasts looking for better performance. When looking at the RTX 4060 Ti model it is clear that it isn't as good as the 4070 since it has fewer cores and a worse interface for memory. But it is still a small improvement over the 3060 Ti which is the older model. The technological features between models can be very different on paper, but in gaming use the 4060 Ti should still pull out ahead. One of the best parts of the new model is that it uses less power. Additionally, the 4060 Ti increases gaming performance in 1080p fairly significantly, especially if the DLSS 3 feature is used. Many games can benefit from this like Counter-Strike 2 and Overwatch 2."},{"prompt":"When did Italy become a republic?","completion":"Italy became a republic in 1946.

I want it to be a numbered list and make readers feel good. Give it a catchy title and an intro, like it’s a blog post. {Tip} {Explanation}","completion":"9 Big Don’ts for New Moms If you recently became a mother or have a little one growing inside, you probably are thinking, “How on earth am I going to do this?” Don’t worry, you are definitely not alone! Becoming a new mother is extremely challenging, so we have made a list of 10 simple don’ts to make your transition into motherhood just a little easier. 1. Don’t Do It Alone! Call for help, whether it's a friend, a partner, or a family member; you don’t need to do it all by yourself. 2. Don’t Cry When They Cry. Babies are going to cry, it doesn’t mean you’re a bad mother. Don’t get down if your baby is crying; it’s perfectly normal. 3. Don’t Neglect YOU. So many mothers forget to take time for self-care! You can’t care for your baby if you’re not taking care of yourself. 4. Don’t Believe Everything You Hear. There is almost too much motherly advice available these days. And focusing on all of it will drive you insane! Find the tips and tricks that work for you, and leave the rest behind. 5. Don’t Get Impatient. It takes time to ease into motherhood. Don’t forget to be patient with yourself and the process. 6. Don’t Forget Your Baby is Unique. Not all babies are the same! What worked for another baby simply might not work for yours, and that’s okay! You’ll get to know your baby’s unique needs and personality in no time. 7. Don’t Forget It’s All a Phase. At the end of the day, everything is a phase when you have a baby. So if you’re in a particularly challenging one, just remember, it will pass. 8. Don’t Have Specific Expectations. You may think you know exactly how you’re going to respond to motherhood or even how your baby is going to act. And it’s just not true! Having specific expectations leads to frustrations and disappointment. Don’t forget to go with the flow! 9. Don’t Worry! Alright, this one is certainly easier said than done. But the truth is, the less you worry in the few first months will make the experience so much more rewarding."},{"prompt":"I am trying to create a function in python that takes a Roman numeral as its argument and then returns the value as a numeric integer.

I believe, despite the price tag associated with building this lounge room, the increase in productivity will ultimately pay for it over a short time.

Even after they purchased their lunches, they are either forced to eat in their cars or at the restaurants they bought their food from. Having a lounge would solve two problems: employees have a place to eat that is at their place of work, and if they chip in every month, the lounge room can be stocked with a variety of foods that can be prepared and eaten right in the room. Tardiness from clocking in late after lunch can be eliminated by having a lounge room in the building. I did some research and was able to determine that it would cost approximately 10,000 to build a new lounge room in the employee work area. This would cover the costs of building the room, as well as furnishing it with tables, chairs, a refrigerator, a microwave, a kitchenette, and vending machines for snacks and drinks.

Here's the text you can use to answer: The costs of the corresponding outages are immense. Numerous analyses show even a one hour power outage can cost commercial and industrial facilities tens of thousands of dollars—and outages often last much longer. In specialized industries like museums, a power outage can mean the difference between a safe, stable climate for art and an environment that starts to quickly degrade priceless artifacts. And as we’ve witnessed in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, damaged grids can claim human lives. That’s why many people argue for “undergrounding,” the process by which existing utility poles are moved from their current spot above the tree canopy to a protected tunnel below the earth. Proponents, who seem to grow more vocal over the summer as hurricane season picks up speed, say this move would ensure the grid’s resiliency, even in hurricane-prone places like south Florida. But Ted Kury, the director of energy studies at the University of Florida’s Public Utility Research Center, says not so fast. Undergrounding could reduce the number of hurricane-related outages in some places.

Include some relevant information about how olive oil has been used by the church in religious ceremonies. Keep the word count under 300 words.","completion":"Olive Oil Facts Olive Oil has been a staple of the Mediterranean diet for centuries. It’s the only vegetable oil that can be consumed just the way it is, freshly pressed from the olive. It contains many beneficial health effects. Consuming just two teaspoons each day can prevent heart disease and gallstones. Research has also shown that it can lower your risk of colon cancer. Olive Oil is a good cure-all for many afflictions. But it has also been used for many centuries in religious ceremonies. In the Roman Catholic church, for instance, olive oil has been utilized by Priests to perform a variety of ceremonies, such as baptisms, Confirmations, and even as fuel for lamps in their churches. During ancient times, olive oil was used to anoint a king during his coronation ceremony. In 1 Samuel 10, the mighty prophet of old Samuel uses a flask of olive oil to anoint Saul, the very first king of Israel. Almost since time began, olives have been associated with peace. An olive tree cannot be grown in a hostile environment. It requires lush, fertile soil and arid temperatures. Even then, it will take several years before the olive tree can produce fruit. But once it does, this amazing tree can live for up to 500 years. Olive trees have an almost titanic resistance, a vital force that renders them nearly immortal. Despite harsh winters and burning summers, despite truncations, they continue to grow, proud and strong, reaching towards the sky, bearing fruit that nourishes and heals, inspires, and amazes."},{"prompt":"Read the passage below and answer these questions: 1. What were the three Korean states in the first half of the first millennium? 2. In which time period did Sejong the Great make the Korean alphabet? During the first half of the 1st millennium, Korea was divided between three states, Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea. In the second half of the 1st millennium, Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo, leading to the \\"Unified Silla\\" period. Meanwhile, Balhae formed in the north, superseding former Goguryeo. Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states due to civil war, ushering in the Later Three Kingdoms. Toward the end of the 1st millennium, Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo, which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state. Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo. Goryeo (also spelled as Koryŏ), whose name developed into the modern exonym \\"Korea\\", was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal movable type in 1234.[3][4][5][6][7][8] However, multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th century greatly weakened the nation, which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting. Following military resistance under King Gongmin that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo, severe political strife followed, and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye, who established Joseon on 17 July 1392.

This includes three types of bees. 1. Workers: Female bees that are unable to reproduce. These workers will tend to the hive while they are young and then leave the hive as they get older to accomplish tasks outside the hive. 2.

I'm allergic to peanuts and tree nuts so don't include any flavors with those ingredients.","completion":"Okay, here is a list of unique ice cream flavor ideas: 1. French Fry: French fry ice cream blends a sweet treat with a salty flavor for fans of dipping fries in milkshakes. 2. Chili Chocolate: Although you won't see this flavor offered very often, it's a great flavor combo that brings spicy and sweet tastes together. 3. Balsamic Vinaigrette: This flavor is completely unique when it comes to the dessert world because it's typically an appetizer or snack flavor. 4. Jalapeno: Spice is a great flavor combination when it comes to sweet foods, and you aren't likely to find this flavor at an ice cream parlor. 5. Sea Salt: Sea salt is an uncommon ice cream flavor that won't overpower the sweetness of the dish. 6. Maple Bacon: This unlikely ice cream flavor combines two delicious breakfast flavors into ice cream. 7. Chicken and Waffles: Chicken and waffles is a popular sweet and savory dish, so turning it into a unique ice cream flavor is an obvious choice. 8.

Turmeric: Turmeric root is a colorful yellow that would make a unique-looking (and tasting) ice cream."},{"prompt":"Which famous American lawyer famously coined the phrase \\"Jane Crow\\" concerning restrictive civil liberties?","completion":"Pauli Murray coined the phrase \\"Jane Crow.\\" In the 1940s, Murray was the only woman in a class of law students. At the time, the U.S. laws protected segregation by racial background often referred to as Jim Crow laws. Murray took that idea a step further and characterized prejudice against women using the term \\"Jane Crow.\\" As a law student, Murray wrote a paper on the unconstitutionality of the Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson. She argued that the case violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Her argument was so influential that her professor gave her paper to Thurgood Marshall and his team and helped them develop their argument against segregation. Murray not only influenced the career of Marshall but also another U.S. Supreme Court Justice: Ruth Bader Ginsburg. A 2021 documentary about Murray, called \\"My Name is Pauli Murray,\\" focused on her life and career as a brilliant, queer, Black, gender-nonconforming scholar."},{"prompt":"Write a short story, of no more than 300 words.

Start with this sentence, \\"The disease had first cropped up in five different towns.\\" The main character desires to survive and to find other survivors.","completion":"The disease had first cropped up in five different towns. It spread like wildfire through the remaining fragments of humanity. No society was untouched. Nina kicked an old, rusty, twisted piece of metal out of her path. This stretch of cracked pavement had remarkably few rusting car hulks littering it, not like the cities. The disease had no mercy; it caused a rapid deterioration of the body and mind. Mother Nature, finally having had enough abuse, had sent the ultimate punishment. Humankind was crumbling under the weight of its arrogance. Nina, one of the lucky ones, was immune to the disease. Or was it unlucky? Whatever, she was alive and determined to stay that way. With her backpack strapped tightly to her face and a wrinkled, worn paper map clutched in her hands, she navigated the desolate wastelands. What she wouldn’t give for a working phone. At first, phones and the internet had worked, even without people to man them. But in time, the electric grid failed. Some solar farms might still be online, and that’s where she’d find people. But they were south. Days turned into weeks as she trudged through barren landscapes, the remnants of civilization slowly being taken back by the planet. If she could reach California the coast would be within striking distance as well. Power, and a food source. Ideal while she attempted to locate other survivors. Nina looked at the drunken green sign. It said, “Welcome to Nevada.” There was still a long way to go."},{"prompt":"Write a short poem about puzzles.

The goblin is a tax official and sometimes wishes he could go back to the good ole days.","completion":"Tyre sat at the bar with his face pressed against his hands. It had been a long day of work in the office and he really needed a drink. The bartender slid a drink his way, and Tyre flipped him a coin. \\"A goblin willing to part with his money? Now I've seen everything.\\" The bartender laughed at his own cutting-edge humor and Tyre just flipped around, swilling his drink in his hand. \\"The war's over, bub,\\" he said in his gritty voice. \\"I ain't lookin' for trouble,\\" the barkeep said, raising his hands in mock surrender. \\"We all know goblins can be vicious when they have a mind to.\\" Tyre grunted and took a swig of his drink. Why did goblins have to hold such a bad reputation? Sure, they might have served a dark lord or two, and, sure, they might have maybe tried to bring about the destruction of mankind more than once, but this was a civil age. Elves were known for their pointy ears, wits, and—as propaganda would have it—gorgeous flowing locks. Goblins, by contrast, were remembered for being subservient, greedy, and bloodthirsty. Tyre worked in an office with lots of humans. He was a tax official, which didn't really help his reputation, but it was honest work. He worked hard, earned a good wage, and spent it wisely. His days of brandishing a club at travelers to relieve them of their gold were long since over, although, just sometimes, Tyre wished they weren't."},{"prompt":"When did George Washington get put on the dollar bill?","completion":"The first 1 Federal Reserve notes were released in 1963.

As if that weren't enough, next came a lumbering giant, *breaking into* our home, feeding the boy preposterous lies about being a wizard. I have never been more furious in my life. So we packed everything we own and drove as far as we could. It was the only choice we had to try and protect the family. And somehow, those freaks *still* found us.

I hate Thursdays. They’re like a weird day stuck in the week. Kind of almost to the weekend but not close enough. School was the worst today.

How am I supposed to deal with him now that she decided that kissing him behind the science room would be fun? He spent half the day following me around wanting to know if he did something wrong, calling me her stupid name. I hate my life. I should do my homework now but my sisters are in here being stupid. Well, not Opal. She’s just in her headphones on her bed. Octavia is dancing around like she’s some superstar. She’s so not. Still Thursday. Octavia tried to pucker up to me at dinner. I think I’m going to cut my hair. The idea makes me sick, but I think Octavia is too vain to do the same thing. Maybe I’ll even dye it some gross color too.

He has short, thinning, dark brown hair and deep-set brown eyes that sparkle with mischief when he's in a good mood. He also sports a goatee and mustache that can increase the tendency towards a resting grump face. Despite his imposing physical presence, John is a gentleman with a warm smile and a kind heart. One of John's defining characteristics is his love of sleeping. He can often be found dozing off on the couch, snuggled under a pile of blankets in bed, or sitting with his head flopped back in his desk chair. His penchant for snoozing is so legendary that he can easily sleep through loud noises, including his own snoring, which is a constant source of frustration for his wife. Speaking of his snoring, John is notorious for his thundering snorts and whistles that can be heard at the other end of the house. Although he has tried various remedies to alleviate the issue, including a c-Pap machine, nothing seems to work. His snoring persists. Despite his sleeping habits, John is a very hard worker and takes his job as a software engineer seriously. He enjoys solving complex problems and spends long hours at his computer, late into the night, often to the detriment of his sleep schedule. However, he always seems to make up for lost sleep by sleeping in until noon and then taking long naps in the afternoons on the weekends. In his free time, John likes to indulge in his love for science fiction, often spending hours reading books or watching movies in the genre. He also enjoys biking and drumming and often plans trips to national parks with his wife and son. Overall, John is a loving and loyal husband and father who enjoys the simple things in life, including a good nap, playing the drums, and a thrilling science fiction novel. His loud snoring may be an annoyance, but it's a small price to pay for the joy and love he brings his family."},{"prompt":"Change Geraldine's name to Gerry and make her nonbinary That afternoon, Mr. Stern, the geometry teacher, started drawing cubes and cylinders on the board. Geraldine sat at her desk adding up a column of figures in her notebook ­ the rent, the light and gas bills, a new gym suit, some socks. Maybe they would move somewhere else, and she could have her own room. Geraldine turned the squares and triangles into little houses in the country. “For your homework,” Mr. Stern was saying with his back to the class, “set your problem up this way.” He wrote GIVEN: in large letters, and then gave a formula for the first problem. Then he wrote TO FIND: and listed three items they were to include in their answers. Geraldine started to raise her hand to ask what all the squares and angles had to do with solving real problems, like the ones she had. Better not, and sat on her hands. Your big mouth got you in trouble last term. In hygiene class, Mrs. Potter kept saying that the body was a wonderful machine. Every time Geraldine looked up from her notebook, she would hear the same thing. “Right now your body is manufacturing all the proteins and tissues and energy you will need to get through tomorrow.” And Geraldine kept wondering, How? How does my body know what it will need, When I don’t even know what I’ll need to get through tomorrow? As she headed down the hall to her next class, Geraldine remembered that she hadn’t done the homework for English. Mrs. Scott had said to write a poem, and Geraldine had meant to do it at lunchtime. After all, there was nothing to it ­ A flower here, a raindrop there, moon, June, rose, nose. But the men carrying off the furniture had made her forget. “And now put away your books,” Mrs. Scott was saying as Geraldine tried to scribble a poem quickly. “Today we can give King Arthur’s knights a rest. Let’s talk about poetry.” Mrs. Scott moved up and down the aisles, talking about her favorite poems and reciting a line now and then. She got very excited whenever she passed a desk and could pick up the homework from a student who had remembered to do the assignment. “A poem is your own special way of saying what you feel and what you see,” Mrs. Scott went on, her lips moist. It was her favorite subject. “Some poets write about the light that… that… makes the world sunny,” she said, passing Geraldine’s desk. “Sometimes an idea takes the form of a picture ­ an image.” For almost half an hour, Mrs. Scott stood at the front of the room, reading poems and talking about the lives of the great poets. Geraldine drew more houses, and designs for curtains. “So for those who haven’t done their homework, try it now,” Mrs. Scott said. “Try expressing what it is like to be… to be alive in this… this glorious world.” “Oh, brother,” Geraldine muttered to herself as Mrs. Scott moved up and down the aisles again, waving her hands and leaning over the students’ shoulders saying, “That’s nice,” or “Keep trying.” Finally she came to Geraldine’s desk and stopped, looking down at her. “I can’t write a poem,” Geraldine said flatly, before she even realized she was going to speak at all. She said it very loudly, and the whole class looked up. “And why not?” Mrs. Scott asked, looking hurt. “I can’t write a poem, Mrs. Scott, because nothing lovely’s been happening in my life. I haven’t seen a flower since Mother’s Day, and the sun don’t shine on my side of the street. No robins come sing on my window sill.” Geraldine swallowed hard. She thought about saying that her father doesn’t even come to visit any more, but changed her mind. “Just the rain comes,” she went on, “and the bills come, and the men to move out our furniture. I’m sorry, but I can’t write no pretty poem.” Teddy Johnson leaned over and was about to giggle and crack the whole class up, but Mrs. Scott looked so serious that he changed his mind. “You have just said the most… the most poetic thing, Geraldine Moore,” said Mrs. Scott. Her hands flew up to touch the silk scarf around her neck. “‘Nothing lovely’s been happening in my life,’” She repeated it so quietly that everyone had to lean forward to hear. “Class,” Mrs. Scott said very sadly, clearing her throat, “you have just heard the best poem you will ever hear.” She went to the board and stood there for a long time staring at the chalk in her hand. “I’d like you to copy it down,” she said. She wrote it just as Geraldine had said it, bad grammar and all. Nothing lovely’s been happening in my life. I haven’t seen a flower since Mother’s Day, And the sun don't even shine on my side of the street. No robins come sing on my window sill.

Mrs. Scott stopped writing, but she kept her back to the class for a long time ­ long after Geraldine had closed her notebook. And even when the bell rang, and everyone came over to smile at Geraldine or to tap her on the shoulder or to kid her about being the school poet, Geraldine waited for Mrs. Scott to put the chalk down and turn around.

The man's family disowned him; his wife left him and his children wished not to be associated with him. His close friends were no longer around to lend a listening ear or provide words of wisdom. The man was effectively cut off from everyone he knew. Five long years had passed for the man, where he had lost his job, became poor, and had to move in with his parents. He became a leech on resources who could not pay for his stay at his parent's house, and he was quickly loathed by them. The man began to drink heavily, carousing in bars and bringing alcohol home to drink in bed and watch television all day and night. He had no desire to move from his position on the bed, and he hated to get up, even to use the bathroom or occasionally take a shower. One day, the man hit his personal rock bottom when one of his children called him to say, \\"You're a loser, you have no job, you drink all the time, and you will die alone.\\" The man, struck to his heart by his child's words, woke up from his daydreaming. A fire stoked by years of anger, frustration, and hurt pride began to burn within him. The man decided to change his fortunes around by changing his life completely. The next year, the man went through many trials and tribulations that tested his resolve. One of the biggest tests he undertook was his daily exercise of jogging. During this year, every day the man decided to run between 4 pm and 5 pm, and every day only during that period the rain would pour on him while he ran outdoors. As soon as he finished running and went into the shelter of his house, the rain would stop. The man began to think he was cursed. This lasted several months until one day, the man's anger, frustration, and hurt pride suddenly disappeared, and now he welcomed the rain during his runs. It was then that the rain stopped and the sun came out. From that day forward, the man put his life back together and became enlightened."},{"prompt":"Write a casual text to my little brother.

When multiple humans gather together, each individual will prefer to go along with majority opinion instead of causing disruption, even when the majority is wrong. c) Humans rely heavily on categorization to help them understand the environment around them. For example, they categorize each other based on skin color, the location of their births, etc. Taken to an extreme, this often leads to a harmful phenomenon called stereotyping where individual differences are erased in favor of common group characteristics. d) Humans select leaders for their groups based on a process called elections.

I was there just over a year before moving on to a different company, in a different field. However, my previous IT experience made that line of “other duties as required” in my job description start being more and more broad in terms of helping with anything from basic help desk stuff such as swapping monitors and keyboards out, to sql database modifications, AD related tasks for users, etc. Most recently, management has saw how a good portion of my current responsibilities hinge on being able to do a lot of the IT related things I’m technically not responsible for, but have been managing, so they want to replace me in my current role and move me into being more responsible for all things IT related.

Maturity may range from as early as 7 to 13 years for leatherbacks, 11 to 16 years for both species of ridleys, 20 to 25 years in hawksbills, 25 to 35 years for loggerheads, and 26 to 40 years in green sea turtles. Mature sea turtles may migrate thousands of miles to reach breeding sites. After mating at sea, adult female sea turtles return to land to lay their eggs. Different species of sea turtles exhibit various levels of philopatry. In the extreme case, females return to the same beach where they hatched. This can take place every two to four years in maturity. The mature nesting female hauls herself onto the beach, nearly always at night, and finds suitable sand in which to create a nest. Using her hind flippers, she digs a circular hole 40 to 50 centimeters (16 to 20 in) deep. After the hole is dug, the female then starts filling the nest with her clutch of soft-shelled eggs. Depending on the species, a typical clutch may contain 50–350 eggs. After laying, she re-fills the nest with sand, re-sculpting and smoothing the surface, and then camouflaging the nest with vegetation until it is relatively undetectable visually. She may also dig decoy nests. The whole process takes 30 to 60 minutes. She then returns to the ocean, leaving the eggs untended.

Her city apartment was suddenly far too small, and she was going crazy. She found the perfect rural cabin online for rent several hours north. When she arrived at the cabin, she couldn’t believe her luck; it was idyllic. Tucked away in the woods without a road or house around, she could really escape it all here. After unpacking her few belongings, making a fire, and making a light dinner, Mary settled into one of the big chairs to read the book she’d been looking at on her shelf for months. But only a few minutes later, she heard a rapping on the window. Surprised at the intrusion of the noise in the silence of her oasis, she got up to see what it was. She saw a branch waving in the wind, obviously hitting the window as it swayed. Mary went back to her book, determined to drown out the sound and remain serene. But she couldn’t even get through one more page before she heard the noise again, this time on a window in the bedroom. Annoyed, Mary walked into the bedroom to check for another branch to see if she could move this one away. But when she got there, there was no branch. Mary wasn’t one to get spooked easily. But all of a sudden, she felt a shiver down her spine and realized, for the first time, that she was completely alone. Calming her nerves, Mary told herself she was being ridiculous. It was nature, nature made sounds. She would simply go back to her book but lock all the windows first. Mary couldn’t shake the feeling that something, or better yet, someone, was at the window again. When she finally looked up from the pages, she saw a shadow moving behind the window. Officially scared, Mary went and got a sharp knife from the kitchen. An hour later, nothing else had happened, and Mary started to feel quite silly sitting with her knife. But right when she started to relax, a bang came from the floorboards directly above her. It was then and there that Mary decided to get the hell out of there.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,[a] it is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the Avengers, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury and the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth. The film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time Edward Norton),[b] and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots. The Avengers premiered in Los Angeles on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, as the final film in Phase One of the MCU. The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score. The film grossed over 1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012, as well as the first Marvel production to generate 1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, The Avengers was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an Empire magazine poll. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 85th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Three sequels have been released: Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).","completion":"1. United Kingdom 2. Ireland 3. Earth 4.

Is there a place called Parmesan?","completion":"Parmesan cheese, which is more accurately named Parmigiano Reggiano, was first made by monks in the Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, and Mantova provinces of Italy as these religious orders began to revitalize the land left abandoned by the Roman occupation. Eventually, these medieval monks had an excess of milk they needed to store before it spoiled. Thus, Parmesan cheese was invented around the mid-1200s. However, how people define parmesan cheese differs by geographical location. In Italy, Parmesan Reggiano must be aged for over a year, made with unprocessed milk, and grated before consumption.

Walking is an activity that most people can do and it has a low impact on lower body joints such as the ankles and knees. Staying inside for long periods of time can increase anxiety and stress and walking outside can circumvent those issues if they arise.

What are the different types of aged ricotta cheese? Fresh variants Ricotta di Bufala Campana and Ricotta Romana are notable varieties produced in Italy and protected by the European Union's Protected Designation of Origin regulation. Ricotta di Bufala Campana is made from the whey left over after the production of Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, a protected variety of buffalo mozzarella. Ricotta Romana is made from the whey of sheep milk.[8] Aged variants Ricotta salata is a firm, salted variety of ricotta. Ricotta affumicata, a smoked variety from the Sila in Calabria Ricotta forte is a very soft variety from Apulia sold in jars. Fresh ricotta can be subject to extra processing to produce variants which have a much longer shelf life. These production methods include salting, baking, smoking, and further fermentation. Ricotta salata is a pressed, salted, dried, and aged variety of the cheese. It is milky-white and firm and used for grating or shaving. Ricotta salata is sold in wheels, decorated by a delicate basket-weave pattern. Ricotta infornata (baked ricotta) is produced by placing a large lump of soft ricotta in the oven until it develops a brown, lightly charred crust, sometimes even until it becomes sandy brown all the way through. Ricotta infornata is popular primarily in Sardinia and Sicily, and is sometimes called ricotta al forno. Ricotta affumicata (smoked ricotta) is similar to ricotta infornata and is produced by placing a lump of soft ricotta in a smoker until it develops a grey crust and acquires a charred wood scent, usually of oak or chestnut wood, although, in Friuli, beech wood is used, with the addition of juniper and herbs.[9] Ricotta forte, also known as ricotta scanta, is produced from leftovers of any combination of cow, goat, or sheep milk ricotta. These are allowed to age for about a year, during which salt is added and the cheese mixed every two or three days to prevent the growth of mold. The end result is a soft and creamy brown paste which has a very pungent and piquant taste.[10][11] It is produced in the southern part of the Province of Lecce and sold in glass jars. It is smeared on bread, mixed with tomato sauces for pasta, or added to vegetable dishes.","completion":"The types of fresh ricotta cheese include Ricotta di Bufala Campana and Ricotta Romana.

Patricia Gualinga, (or Patricia Gualinga Montalvo)[1] is a women human rights defender and indigenous rights defender of the Pueblo Kichwa de Sarayaku (Kichwa People of Sarayaku), an indigenous community in the Ecuadorian Amazon.[2][3] Patricia's nieces Nina Gualinga and Helena Gualinga are also environmental and indigenous rights activists.[4] Her mother Cristina Gualinga is also a land defender, who passed down the family tradition.[5] Her sister Noemí Gualinga, who has a lower profile as an activist, is a community leader,[6] while her brother Eriberto Gualinga is a globetrotting filmmaker who documents the Sarayaku resistance.[7] Gualinga currently lives in cantón del Puyo, in the Pastaza Province of Ecuador.[2] Activism Gualinga is the International Relations director for the Kichwa First People of Sarayaku.[8] She has played an important role in the fight for indigenous rights. Gualinga is a spokeswoman for many environmental projects.[1] She led the women's group of the Pueblo Kichwa de Sarayaku (Kichwa People of Sarayaku) for six years. She worked to strengthen the organisation of women in the community; organised workshops and childcare for women attending the workshops to learn how to speak for the community, respond to media and respond to the arguments of industries and governments.[1] Inter-American Court of Human Rights In 2012, Gualinga was one of the representatives in a case presented to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR).[2][9] The Ecuadorian government authorized oil exploration by Argentinian oil company Compañía General de Combustibles (CGC), also known as the Argentinean General Fuel Company, on territory held by the Sarayaku, exploration which the community resisted through local protests and a court case.[10] The community won this case,[3] in which the Ecuadorian government was found guilty of human rights violations, having authorized oil exploration and militarization of Sarayaku lands without first consulting the community.[11] The appropriation of community land for extractive industries without free, prior, and informed consent was found to have been illegal.[12] In 2018, Gualinga joined the Climate Change Summit of COP23, where had the opportunity to speak about Amazonian communities in Germany, expanding her connections and cause.[13] She is a spokesperson for the indigenous-led proposal 'Kawsak Sacha', or 'Living Forest', which calls for legal protection of the Ecuadorian Amazon.[14] Having successfully defended Sarayaku lands in the 2012 case, Gualinga currently works to protect the Kichwa People of Sarayaku and their lands from human rights violations resulting from similar oil extraction projects by Chinese companies.[12] Death threats Gualinga was the victim of a home invasion[6] on 5 January 2018 by an unidentified man who entered by breaking a window with a thrown rock and shouted death threats at her, saying \\"the next time I will kill you\\". The attacker escaped, despite being chased by a policeman.[13] Many Indigenous rights defenders have previously reported threats and harassment as a consequence of their human rights work.[3] In response, indigenous rights defense collective Mujeres Amazónicas (Amazonian Women) called for investigations into the intimidation of its members, delivering on March 9, 2020[6] over 250,000 signatures to the Attorney General of Ecuador and complaining about the stagnation of the investigations. Ecuador had ratified the Escazú Agreement in February 2020, a commitment to protect environment and land defenders by Latin American nations, which feature the highest rates of violent deaths for such activists,[15] 116 environmental defenders having been killed in the region in 2017, according to a Global Witness report.[13]","completion":"On January 5, 2018, Patricia Gualinga was the victim of a home invasion."},{"prompt":"I am writing a completely fictional book about the first five presidents.

Additionally, homemade muffins are easy to freeze and thaw for quick, on-the-go breakfast options. - Breakfast sandwiches.

Nobody could have imagined that just a few months later they would be lifting the Stanley Cup trophy for the first time in franchise history. A season that started with frustration ended in glory, but how did it happen? When the Blues fired coach Mike Yeo after starting 7-9-3 in the first 19 games, hopes for a good season largely went down the drain. After that, it wasn't as if things improved immediately. The Blues named Craig Berube as interim coach and the team continued to stumble before bottoming out as the last-place team in the entire league. Nobody would have been surprised if the team, coaches, and fans threw in the towel on a disappointing season. But that never happened. Instead, the Blues went on one of the most improbable runs in sports history. And it all started with Jordan Binnington. After starting the year as the organization's 4th ranked goaltender, Binnington was given an opportunity to start for the team in mid-January. In his first three starts, Binnington allowed just two goals in his first three starts. With Binnington's stellar performance in net, the Blues slowly began to work their way back up the standings, finishing the season on a 30-10-5 run in their last 45 games. Binnington continued to impress during the playoffs, starting in goal for all 16 Blues wins, including an incredible performance in game 7 against both the Stars and Bruins. Along with Binnington, the Blues got major playoff contributions from David Perron, Ryan O'Reilly, and role players like Tyler Bozak."},{"prompt":"Is there an exponent operator in C#?

Write it in a casual tone but keep it professional.","completion":"Today we are looking at the blood group diet. What is this diet, you ask? It's a type of diet that a physician called Dr. Peter D’Adamo developed in 1996. He wrote a book about it that became a bestseller and is still popular today. Dr. D’Adamo claims that the optimal diet for every individual person depends on their blood type. Do you know how we talk about having a blood type A, B, AB, or O? Well, that's what this diet is based on. Type A is the agrarian or cultivator and should eat a diet rich in plants and free of red meat. Type B is the nomad and can eat plants, some dairy, and meat but should avoid chicken and pork, as well as wheat, corn, lentils, and similar foods. Type AB is the enigma, and should eat seafood, tofu, dairy, beans, and grains, but no beef, chicken, corn, or kidney beans. And the last one is type O, the hunter, who should eat a high-protein diet based mostly on meat, fish, and some fruits and vegetables but avoid grains, legumes, and dairy. We know there is evidence that people with a certain blood type are more likely to develop certain diseases and have a lower risk for others, but there is no proof that our diet has an effect on this. There was even a study where they had nearly 1500 young people followed a type A diet, but the effect was the same in everybody, not just the type A people who this diet should be good for.

When Poppy was just eight years old she ventured into the forest on her own to play and never returned home. The entire city searched the woods for her, but she was nowhere to be seen. After many years of her absence, she was presumed dead. Over the years citizens would swear they spotted her roaming in the woods, covered in mud and moss hunting and foraging, only to run away when approached. Those sightings were largely considered to be false - hoaxes for attention from the Figglebottom family and a chance to earn some of the reward funds. Fifteen years after her mysterious disappearance she returned. She'd been hardened by the forest, as she was forced to live on her own and endure living in nature by herself. Poppy was welcomed back into the Figglebottom House with open arms but soon after she returned, her father fell ill. He died just three weeks after her arrival, leaving her in charge of the entire city. Even though she was back with her family in the home she was born in, she wasn't comfortable there.

Except for information about his parents, marriages, children, and military career, leave out most of the information about his personal life.","completion":"Glenn Ford, born in Canada in 1916 to Newton and Hannah Ford, began acting in high school after his family moved to California when he was eight. Discovered by a 20th Century Fox scout in 1939, he signed a contract with Columbia Pictures shortly thereafter. He made his official debut in Heaven with a Barbed Wire Fence (1939). He had numerous small film roles until he joined the Marines during World War II. In 1943, Ford married dancer and actress Eleanor Powell (the first of four marriages that all ended in divorce) with whom he had his only child, Peter Ford. After the war, he found it difficult to restart his career until Bette Davis gave him a role in A Stolen Life (1946). Ford followed that with the role that made him a star, Gilda (1946). Often cast as a calm, everyday hero in films such as The Big Heat (1953), Blackboard Jungle (1955) 3:10 to Yuma (1957), and The Rounders (1965), he worked continually in film and television through the 1990s.

You want to build something your customers will love, but you don’t want the setup to take several months or be so technical that you need a developer for every single copy update. In your research, you’ve probably come across WordPress as a possible solution. But there’s one issue — you have no clue what WordPress is or how it can help your business. WordPress is an open-source content management system (CMS). It’s a popular tool for individuals without any coding experience who want to build websites and blogs.

There's no need to attend a studio or even leave the comfort of your own home with countless free dance workouts available on platforms like YouTube. You can find workouts and routines of various lengths, skill levels, and music tastes. 2. Walking. The power of a simple walk cannot be understated. Walking is the simplest low-intensity cardio, can be done almost anywhere, and boosts both physical and mental well-being. In colder climates, many indoor shopping centres permit and encourage early morning or late evening walking to keep active in bitter winters. 3. Swimming. If you live near a lake, or ocean, or have a pool, swimming is a fantastic form of cardio that is gentle on the joints and refreshing. Lap swimming can be self-regulated to be intense or relaxing, while activities like water aerobics can be done solo or in group classes. Check out your local community swimming pools for classes. 4. Jumping rope. This high-intensity cardio workout burns a lot of calories for very little investment. Jump ropes are widely available online and require a relatively small amount of space to use. There are free tutorials available on YouTube to learn about or improve your rope jumping technique. 5. Stair climbing. Climbing stairs is great cardio and an excellent lower-body workout. By using your stairs at home, a nearby park, or even your office parking garage, you can get a great workout in for no additional cost. The best way to ensure you stick to an exercise plan is to make sure that you enjoy the exercise you're doing.

'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is a red-blooded adventure movie, dripping with atmosphere, filled with the gruesome and the sublime, and surprisingly faithful to the novel. A lot of things could have gone wrong, and none of them have: Chris Columbus' movie is an enchanting classic that does full justice to a story that was a daunting challenge. The novel by J.K. Rowling was muscular and vivid, and the danger was that the movie would make things too cute and cuddly. It doesn't. Like an \\"Indiana Jones\\" for younger viewers, it tells a rip-roaring tale of supernatural adventure, where colorful and eccentric characters alternate with scary stuff like a three-headed dog, a pit of tendrils known as the Devil's Snare and a two-faced immortal who drinks unicorn blood. Scary, yes, but not too scary--just scary enough. Three high-spirited, clear-eyed kids populate the center of the movie. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter, he with the round glasses, and like all of the young characters he looks much as I imagined him, but a little older. He once played David Copperfield on the BBC, and whether Harry will be the hero of his own life in this story is much in doubt at the beginning. Deposited as a foundling on a suburban doorstep, Harry is raised by his aunt and uncle as a poor relation, then summoned by a blizzard of letters to become a student at Hogwarts School, an Oxbridge for magicians. Our first glimpse of Hogwarts sets the tone for the movie's special effects. Although computers can make anything look realistic, too much realism would be the wrong choice for \\"Harry Potter,\\" which is a story in which everything, including the sets and locations, should look a little made up. The school, rising on ominous Gothic battlements from a moonlit lake, looks about as real as Xanadu in \\"Citizen Kane,\\" and its corridors, cellars and great hall, although in some cases making use of real buildings, continue the feeling of an atmospheric book illustration. At Hogwarts, Harry makes two friends and an enemy. The friends are Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), whose merry face and tangled curls give Harry nudges in the direction of lightening up a little, and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), all pluck, luck and untamed talents. The enemy is Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), who will do anything, and plenty besides, to be sure his house places first at the end of the year. The adult cast of prominent British actors play their roles believably. There is a broad style of British acting which wouldn't have worked in this movie, so the actors made some changes. Alan Rickman draws out his words yet somehow stays in character. Maggie Smith is Professor Minerva McGonagall, who assigns first year students at Hogwarts like Harry, to one of the school's four houses. Richard Harris is long-beared Dumbledore, the school's headmaster. Robbie Coltrane is the gamekeeper, Hagrid, who has a record of misbehavior, says important things yet is in somewhat disbelief of them. Computers create gravity-defying action scenes. Readers of the book will wonder how the movie brings the game of Quidditch to life. If Quidditch is a masterfully-crafted sequence, there are other great scenes and sets brought to life through the use of technology. A chess game with life-size chess pieces. A room with flying keys. The previously-mentioned Devil's Snare and a dark forest where a creature who threatens Harry is scared away by a centaur. Not to mention the dark shadows of Hogwarts library, cellars, hidden passages, and dungeons, where an invisibility cloak becomes useful for hiding. \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is predicted to be an ageless classic, set to make many generations of fans.

Thomas Kyd was born in 1558 to Francis Kyd, a scrivener, and his wife, Anne. Although we don't know the date of Kyd's birth, we know that he was baptised at the church of St Mary Woolnoth in London on 6th November 1558. Usually, a baby was baptised within just a few days of birth so Kyd was probably born in the first few days of November. In 1565, at the age of around seven, Kyd started at the Merchant Taylor's School, where he was educated until 1575. Subjects taught included Latin, French and Italian, and Kyd would also have had the opportunity to perform in plays during his time there. We know very little about Kyd's life, but we know now that he wrote The Spanish Play, which was performed by Lord Strange's Men at the Rose Theatre for Philip Henslowe on 23rd February 1592, and which went on to be performed twenty-nine times between 1592 and 1597. Kyd's biographer, J. R. Mulryne, also points out that \\"The publication record is still more impressive, with at least eleven editions between 1592 and 1633, a tally unequalled by any of the plays of Shakespeare.\\" In May 1593, Kyd was arrested and imprisoned after his rooms and offices were searched and \\"vile heretical Conceiptes denyinge the deity of Jhesus Christe or Savior\\" were allegedly found. Kyd pleaded his innocence, claiming that the papers belonged to fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe. Marlowe was arrested and released, but then died after being stabbed to death at a house in Deptford Strand, near London. Kyd was eventually released but died in 1594 at the age of about thirty-six.

A more recent adaptation of Warhol's quip, possibly prompted by the rise of online social networking, blogging, and internet celebrity, is the claim that \\"In the future, everyone will be famous to fifteen people\\" or, in some renditions, \\"On the Web, everyone will be famous to fifteen people\\".[17] This quote, though attributed to David Weinberger, was said[17] to have originated with the Scottish artist Momus.[18] The Marilyn Manson song \\"I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)\\", released on his 1998 album Mechanical Animals, alludes to the term in the line \\"We're rehabbed and we're ready for our fifteen minutes of shame\\", as part of the song's theme of unrepentant escapism through drugs. In 1993, the British techno/industrial music group Sheep on Drugs released a single \\"15 Minutes of Fame\\" which reached the lower reaches of the UK Singles Chart.[19] Musician and actor Tim Minchin refers to the phrase (and to Warhol explicitly) in his song \\"15 minutes\\", wherein the phrase \\"15 minutes of shame\\" is sung repeatedly to describe the phenomenon of online shaming.[20]","completion":"Nineteen eighty-seven, nineteen eighty-nine, nineteen ninety-three, nineteen ninety-seven, nineteen ninety-eight, two thousand six"},{"prompt":"How do I hardboil an egg?","completion":"It's very easy!

Mount Hood is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc. It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is located about 50 mi (80 km) east-southeast of Portland, on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties. In addition to being Oregon's highest mountain, it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence, and it offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America. The height assigned to Mount Hood's snow-covered peak has varied over its history. Modern sources point to three different heights: 11,249 ft (3,429 m), a 1991 adjustment of a 1986 measurement by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey (NGS),[1] 11,240 ft (3,426 m) based on a 1993 scientific expedition,[6] and 11,239 ft (3,425.6 m)[7] of slightly older origin.

Excellent Optimization A transportation management system or TMS can help a trucking company or fleet optimize its business. It helps create ways for a company to get the most out of its fleets. From finding the best routes to get you to your destination faster, to advanced telemetrics that can assist with keeping your sensitive materials at the right temperature, this system enables better efficiency within your business to allow your company to operate more professionally and help you gain more profits. 2. Fewer Billing and Paycheck Issues Slow-paying clients and incorrect paychecks due to human error can do severe damage to your turnover rate. When you use a TMS program, it can help guarantee your drivers are paid accurately and on time. These programs also provide the option to create statements that are straightforward and easy to understand. 3. Improved Driver Analytics Owners of large fleets can learn a large amount of information from the data they collect from different sources. But, if you are unable to collect that data and present it in a way where everyone on your team can understand it, that information is useless to you. An efficient TMS system will produce the data you need in a clear and concise manner. It takes care of all the difficult work associated with gathering these details so you can focus on other areas of your business."},{"prompt":"I want to start a home-based business that doesn't require a lot of investment.

Credit: Dmitriy Sladkov / Adobe Stock KEY TAKEAWAYS Loneliness is \\"the state of distress or discomfort that results when one perceives a gap between one’s desires for social connection and actual experiences of it.\\" A new study finds that the brains of people who score higher in loneliness react in unique ways when viewing video content, while the brains of non-lonely individuals react similarly to each other. The results suggest that lonely individuals may literally view the world in a different way, perhaps finding less value in life moments that non-lonely individuals would enjoy. Ross Pomeroy Copy a link to the article entitled http://Brain%20scans%20hint%20that%20lonely%20individuals%20process%20the%20world%20differently Share Brain scans hint that lonely individuals process the world differently on Facebook Share Brain scans hint that lonely individuals process the world differently on Twitter Share Brain scans hint that lonely individuals process the world differently on LinkedIn The brains of lonely individuals respond to video stimuli in unique ways dissimilar from their peers, while the brains of less lonely people respond similarly to others’, suggesting that lonely individuals may process the world differently, which could exacerbate or even trigger their loneliness. This finding was recently published in the journal Psychological Science. Loneliness on the brain Elisa Baek, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Southern California-Dornsife, led the investigation when she was a postdoctoral fellow at UCLA. She and her colleagues utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record the brains of college students as they watched a collection of 14 short videos during a 90-minute session. The videos included highlights from sporting events, clips from documentaries, and emotional depictions of human life, and 66 students participated. After undergoing the lengthy scans, they subsequently completed an extensive questionnaire intended to gauge how lonely they feel. As Psychology Today defines, “loneliness is the state of distress or discomfort that results when one perceives a gap between one’s desires for social connection and actual experiences of it.” Baek and her co-authors then divided the students into “lonely” and “non-lonely” groups, determined by their scores from the survey. Students who had a loneliness score below the median were categorized as lonely, while those who scored above were considered non-lonely. The researchers then conducted a thorough statistical analysis in which each individual’s brain imaging results were compared to every other individual’s. They found that the more lonely a person was, the more distinct their brain imaging results were compared to those of the other volunteers. Each lonely person is lonely in their own way “We found that non-lonely individuals were very similar to each other in their neural responses, whereas lonely individuals were remarkably dissimilar to each other and to their non-lonely peers,” the researchers summarized. The results held even when controlling for the number of friends each participant reported, reaffirming prior research showing that anyone can be lonely regardless of their social connections.","completion":"You can find the results of this study published in a scientific journal known as Psychological Science.

There is no need to number each item.","completion":"Create Outdoor Seating - As simple as it may sound, normal plastic buckets can work well for extra outdoor seating. Just turn the buckets over so the open ends are facing down and then sit over the closed end. It won't be as comfortable as an actual chair, but it will work in a pinch if you have no other seating alternatives. You can also staple or glue padding (such as carpeting or a blanket) to the closed side of the bucket to help make it more comfortable to sit on. Mix Concrete - Plastic buckets are a great DIY alternative to concrete mixers if you need to, well, mix concrete. Besides the natural ingredients to make concrete (cement, water, and aggregates such as crushed stone or gravel), you'll also need an appropriate tool such, as a trowel, to mix everything in the bucket. Make A Bird or Animal Feeder - A plastic bucket will work great as a DIY bird or animal feeder. Take a normal five-gallon bucket, and cut a hole at the bottom. Fit the elbow of a PVC pipe into this hole and cut open part of the pipe for the feed to show through. Be sure to close off the open end of the bucket with a lid. You can use this to feed chickens or other farm or homestead animals. Use As A Buoy or Rescue Flotation Device - Take a five-gallon bucket with a good lid and seal it so the air remains trapped inside. Attach a rope or paracord to the handle of the bucket, and then you can throw it out into a lake or river to mark a spot on the water (like a buoy). Alternatively, you can also use this same kind of device as an emergency rescue flotation device.

When you've decided to travel abroad, put into place these problems, and make sure you evaluate your decisions on where you stand about them, then decide on one perfect location to avoid inconvenience. 2. Check on vaccination status. There are countries where prior vaccinations against certain types of diseases are required or recommended. Visit your doctor and find out from them if you need to be vaccinated before boarding your flight to your destination. 3. Check on your passport expiration date. Many countries do not allow visitors with passports that are nearly expiring, usually the last six months till their expiration date. If yours is expiring soon, renew it before travel. 4. Having passport copies. Your passport may get lost or, worse, stolen along with your belongings. When you have copies of your passport, you will have a quick solution and not panic about what to do. 5. Register with your embassy. In case of war or any other emergency, your country's embassy will be the best place to get help.

Kidnapped friends or family: A sibling, parent, or close friend of theirs is spirited away by the main opposing force in the novel, and the main protagonist is the only person who can (or wants to) rescue them. 2. They are being hunted: The main protagonist has qualities that match a prophecy that the main antagonist doesn't want to be fulfilled. Enemies arrive one day, driving the protagonist away from their home. 3. The village is destroyed: An enemy army or monster arrives and destroys the village. The main protagonist flees along with the rest of the village to survive. 4. A trip gone awry: The main protagonist has to deliver crops to a neighboring town and is waylaid on the way there by a force related to the main antagonist. 5. An important item is stolen: A special item of great value is stolen from the village, and the main protagonist joins (or is drafted into) the party sent to recover it. Do those work for your story?

An odd way of speaking, Bruce thought, considering the stranger maybe thought too highly of himself for simply telling someone they should change their tire. Bruce unpacked his tools and knelt down to begin the tire change when he noticed the man had not left. Again, the stranger spoke: “I’ve got you for three minutes.” Then, once again, “The story of my life is not for the faint of heart. If somebody said it was a happy little tale, if somebody told you I was just your average ordinary guy, not a care in the world, somebody lied.” “What is with this guy? Surely it is going to take longer than three minutes for me to finish this.” Bruce’s inner thoughts pondered as he continued working on the tire situation. Nonsense continued to pour from the stranger’s mouth until the job was finished. Then, Bruce was greeted with a camera in his face. “If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong, we can certainly get a picture of this weirdo,” mumbled the stranger while aiming his lens at Bruce. Bruce assumed an aggressive position, then contextualizing using the full size of the stranger’s massive body against the smallness of his own frame, retreated back to a neutral sitting position atop his moped before speeding away.

Richard knew that a showdown with them would be taking place next week in Thetford, so Richard proclaimed: \\"I will be the one to break their pattern, even if I have to use every breath I take.\\" Richard carbo-loaded every night before the race by polishing off a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs and made sure that he slept at least eight hours each night. The race came, and Richard managed to keep Riverdale's #5 guy in his sights. After cresting a hill on a long dirt road in the woods, they ran around a circle that masqueraded as a picnic area with several open pit BBQ areas. Richard then looked ahead and saw the other half of the dirt road with a very long downhill!

Richard then entered an open field with half a mile to go, sprinted with all of his might, and never looked back. The pattern was finally broken! The next day, Richard was delighted to see the sports section of his local newspaper with an article headlined: \\"Riverdale Experiences The Eye Of The Hurricanes.\\" A reporter at the race was very impressed with Richard's performance and said the following in the article: \\"Riverdale won the meet with a score of 16 points. Richard, Baskerville's lone foreign intruder, became the first runner this year to break up Riverdale's elite pack by nailing down fifth place.\\" Riverdale still ended up winning the state meet at the end of the season, but for that \\"sole\\" moment, Richard felt like he was on top of the world."},{"prompt":"What teas are in the English Breakfast Black Tea sold by Spice Jungle?","completion":"Spice Jungles English Breakfast Black Tea is a blend of a malty and bitter Assum tea, a sour and piney Ceylon tea, a fruity and floral Kenyan tea, and a citric and smoky Keemun tea."},{"prompt":"Write an anti-joke about a group of people from different religions walking into a bar.","completion":"A Buddhist, a Christian, and a Muslim walk into a bar.

One of the top three should be the lesser-known Color of Money. Provide a brief description of each film. Include a title and introduction, leave out the conclusion as I want to write it myself.","completion":"Tom Cruise's Best Moments: The Original Jack of All Trades Introduction Tom Cruise is one of the best-known actors in the world, famous for performing his own death-defying stunts. It’s hard not to be impressed by a close-up shot of Mr. Cruise driving a car at breakneck speeds while weaving in between traffic, or piloting a helicopter. But you may be surprised that our top 3 picks contain more tense moments based on great acting rather than just adrenaline-pumping action. -The Color of Money (1986) Cruise’s first entry on the list is a sequel to a film that he wasn’t in. You may not have heard of The Color of Money, but you will have probably heard of a little film that came out the same year, by the name of Top Gun. 1986 was clearly a good year for Tom Cruise. A film about playing pool may not sound like everyone’s cup of tea, but if you give the film a chance, both Cruise and his co-stars, most notably Paul Newman who was the star of the prequel “The Hustler” manage to draw you into their world. Cruise and the old, wise character of Newman grow closer throughout the film. -Minority Report (2002) A movie about a future where murderers are arrested before they have committed any crime. One of the teams tasked with arresting these future murderers is accused of a future murder himself. This movie felt fresh and even groundbreaking when it was first released back in 2002. The film even featured a reference to future technology, such as the scene where Chief Anderton, played by Cruise, is using his hands to manipulate images and information on a large screen. 18 years later, we can all do this on our phones every day, but the film was shot 5 years before the first iPhone was even released. -Rain Man (1988) Another film where Cruise firmly has his acting hat on—a real tear-jerker with some great comedic moments, too. A selfish young entrepreneur finds out that his father has left a fortune to his Autistic brother. Charlie (Cruise) decides to take his brother (Hoffman) across America on a trip to convince him to give the money over to him."},{"prompt":"Is the following article serious news or satirical?

The plot involves two scientists and an extremely intelligent super computer that are sent to investigate an event near Jupiter. While this plot sounds like the conventional narrative of a sci-fi movie, several scenes are much more surreal and open-ended, such as early hominids learning to use tools before discovering a mysterious monolith that suddenly appears before them. A giant centrifuge was built to serve as the interior of the spaceship as well as many expensive visual effects. An iconic psychedelic sequence that takes place near the conclusion of the film was so complex it was referred to by staff as the \\"Manhattan Project.\\" 15 minutes was removed from the final cut by Kubrick, but the total runtime of the film still ran well over the 2 hour mark."},{"prompt":"Convert the tips about seeing bears in residential areas of Florida into a FAQ document. FLORIDA — The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is reminding Floridians to be aware of their surroundings as bears become more active this time of year. If you live in an area with more bears, follow these preventative measures to keep your family and your home safe: 1: Never feed or approach bears Feeding bears can make them lose their natural fear of people. It is illegal in Florida to intentionally feed bears or leave out food or garbage that will attract bears and cause conflicts. Getting close to a wild animal is dangerous. 2: Secure food and garbage Store garbage in a sturdy shed or garage, and then put it out on the morning of pickup rather than the night before. If not stored in a secured building, modify your existing garbage can to make it more bear-resistant or use a bear-resistant container. Secure commercial garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters. Protect gardens, beehives, compost and livestock with electric fencing. Pick ripe fruit from trees and bushes, and remove fallen fruit from the ground. 3: Remove or secure bird and wildlife feeders Remove wildlife feeders. If wildlife feeders are left up, only put enough food out for wildlife to finish eating before dark and make feeders bear-resistant. 4: Never leave pet food outdoors Feed pets indoors. If feeding pets outdoors, only put food outside for short time periods and bring in leftover food and dishes after each feeding. 5: Clean and store grills Clean and degrease grills and smokers after each use. If mobile, store them in a secure shed or garage. 6: Alert neighbors to bear activity If you see a bear, let your neighbors know. Share tips on how to avoid conflicts with bears. Encourage your homeowner’s association or local government to institute bylaws or ordinances to require trash be kept secure. If you want to report someone who harming bears or intentionally feeding them, call the FWC’s Wildlife Alert Hotline at 888-404-FWCC (3922).

Jerry was invited to participate in the season's most important race only because every other driver had gotten food poisoning from a recent barbecue. On the day of the race, Jerry's nerves got the best of him, and he drove the wrong way on the track for the entire duration of the race. The crowd laughed him off of the track.

The invention of tofu is credited to Prince Liu An of Anhui province. It took many centuries for tofu to reach other neighboring countries. Japan was introduced to it in the Nara Period (710-794) and, according to scholars, it reached Vietnam as early as the 10th century.

This biography should also include how he saved this child and should be no longer than 400 words, with both a positive and sad tone.","completion":"Timothy Thompson has always shown little interest in making new friends or being talkative around others. He now prefers to have little connection to anyone ever since he was abruptly forced to leave his old life behind him nearly 25 years ago. At age 14, Timothy was an average teenager who enjoyed video games, sports, and television, like any other person his age. Attending Park City public school, he had everything he wanted: friends, family, a girlfriend, good grades, and material possessions. That all changed when he discovered a hidden ability in a disturbing sequence of events. Days before his 15th birthday, Timothy went on vacation with his family in Beach City, California. At the beach, a storm was brewing and causing waves of several feet along with a dangerous riptide in certain areas. Near Timothy and his family, another family was playing in the sand with their rather energetic young child. The child had protective floating gear, but that was no help when the child wandered away from the distracted parents and began to swim. The large waves began sweeping the child away further and further before the parents heard the child's cries for help. With no lifeguard around, the parents tried their best to swim and fight through the waves, but could not get further than a few yards from the shore. Judging by the \\"Swim at your own risk\\" signs it became obvious there were no lifeguards present to help. Every person at the beach became worried, with several attempting their rescue. Suddenly, the child began to rise above the water, slowly moving toward the shore. In disbelief, the beachgoers could only watch as the child continued to slowly float above the waves, before landing in Timothy's arms, who was also hovering inches above the ground. They both landed in the sand, with Timothy in a trance-like stare. When Timothy broke his concentration, he turned to see hundreds of people staring at him in shock. Timothy and his family immediately left and returned to the hotel. Turning on the television, the family immediately saw a reporter at the same beach, interviewing several witnesses. Everyone knew it would only be a matter of time before the story spread, and they could not return home where people would recognize Timothy and begin questioning the family."},{"prompt":"Write a story about a person who could see 1 minute into the future and the things she did, how she earned money and gave it back","completion":"Sarah was a fairly ordinary 32-year-old from Vermont. But she hid a secret that she kept to her grave. She swore to herself never to tell anyone. After all, she didn't want to end up as a science experiment in a lab. She could see up to a minute into the future and it was always accurate. Depending on the circumstance, she could change the outcome more than not. Sarah's first big breakthrough with her gift was when she sensed that her grandmother was about to fall. She didn't know what was going to happen, but at 86, a broken femur or other critical bone would end her life in a hurry. Sarah opened her car door and charged onto the scene as fast as she could. Her grandmother was navigating up her mobile home steps and was on the first step. Sarah ran to catch her as her grandmother's foot slipped on the third step. Sarah lunged forward, saving her grandmother from an otherwise potentially fatal accident. Knowing this gift, Sarah became deeply involved in the stock market and enjoyed gambling. The #1 rule she told herself was to never take more than would be reasonable and never be suspicious. She wanted to use her gift to help others. She'd go to the roulette wheel and play her odds. She'd drop chips on the 2, 4, and 9, knowing they weren't going to gain anything. But the 14 was going to be the winner. In an hour, she'd come in with 100 and walk away with 1,800. The dealers shrugged it off as a lucky evening. But a 1,700 profit in an hour was nothing to scoff at. To diversify, she also experimented with some trading with stocks and options. It was scary how much money she could make. She severely limited her earnings to keep under the radar from the SEC. By the time she was 50, she had earned 19 million in profits, mostly from gambling and trading. She gave most of it back anonymously to her family, friends, community, and those in need. She hoped to be an inspiration for others to give back and change the world."},{"prompt":"Create an advertisement for the grand opening of a new theme park named Super Amazing Land.

Eisenhower created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) by signing the National Aeronautics and Space Act on July 29, 1958. Assets and research programs previously administrated by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) were transferred to NASA as part of the act. The creation of NASA was a response to the USSR's launch of a series of Sputnik satellites. The USSR launched the first Sputnik satellite on October 4, 1957. This launch is generally recognized as the start of the Space Age. It also officially began the Space Race between the USSR and the United States of America. The United States of America initially saw NASA and the Space Race as a matter of national security. Whoever controlled space would have the high ground in the event of a conflict. At the time, the USSR and USA were locked in the Cold War, a political and ideological rivalry between the two superpowers. NASA was given the task of developing the space capabilities of the United States, including creating the capacity to launch living organisms and hardware into space. Early efforts to launch organisms into space included launching two monkeys named Able and Baker on a suborbital flight on May 28, 1959. Both monkeys survived, though Able died two years later and Baker spent most of her life on display after the flight. NASA's Mercury Program also launched chimpanzees on test flights before sending astronauts. During the 1960s and 1970s, NASA conducted the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs, which taught many valuable lessons about conducting space missions that it still uses. Apollo sent crews to the Moon for the first time during the late 1960s and early 1970s. While the Cold War ended with the collapse of the USSR, NASA continues to conduct scientific research in space and conduct its crewed space programs. It is currently a partner in the International Space Station and is preparing to return astronauts to the Moon with the Artemis Program."},{"prompt":"Write a parody episode from\\" The Wolf of Wall Street\\" on his first day as the new boss.

The market was also extremely saturated; too many low-quality games being sold at once meant that people weren't willing to press the continue button anymore and stopped buying games. This led to a huge lack of trust between gamers and developers. Video games and consoles were also really expensive.

Add this super smelly vanilla and take this rubber flat thing to scrape the bowl. Then, turn down the electric bowl thingy to like, number 3. Add in more powder a little at a time but also put in thick milk too here and there. You have to mix this really good so it looks nice and yummy. Once that is made, you need to pour this into the pan with the little cups. You need to add paper cups to this pan so they come out easy. You shouldn't fill them all the way though or else they will bubble over and make a mess. My mommy doesn't like it when I make a mess. Put these in the oven but make sure you press the buttons to make it say 3-5-0 first. I think 20 minutes should be good. Take them out after they're done but let your mommy do this or you will hurt yourself. Don't eat them right away or else you'll burn your mouth. I've done that before and it hurts.

Non-fiction, children's, mystery, educational or war & military. Charlotte Illes Is Not a Detective. Katie Siegel. For anyone seeking to satisfy their Harriet the Spy, Encyclopedia Brown, or Nancy Drew nostalgia, this charming, entertaining debut based on the popular @katiefliesaway TikTok series stars a twentysomething former kid detective who’s coaxed out of retirement for one last case. The downside of being a famous child detective is that sooner or later, you have to grow up... As a kid, Charlotte Illes’ uncanny sleuthing abilities made her a minor celebrity. But in high school, she hung up her detective’s hat and stashed away the signature blue landline in her “office”—aka garage—convinced that finding her adult purpose would be as easy as tracking down missing pudding cups or locating stolen diamonds. Now twenty-five, Charlotte has a nagging fear that she hit her peak in middle school. She’s living with her mom, scrolling through job listings, and her love life consists mostly of first dates. When it comes to knowing what to do next, Charlotte hasn’t got a clue. And then, her old blue phone rings... Reluctantly, Charlotte is pulled back into the mystery-solving world she knew—just one more time. But that world is a whole lot more complicated for an adult. As a kid, she was able to crack the case and still get her homework done on time. Now she’s dealing with dead bodies, missing persons, and villains who actually see her as a viable threat. And the detective skills she was once so eager to never use again are the only things that can stop a killer ready to make sure her next retirement is permanent... https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59841496-charlotte-illes-is-not-a-detective","completion":"This book falls under the mystery category."},{"prompt":"What are 3 good ways to spark my marriage?","completion":"Try these! 1- Plan a surprise date night. 2- Try a new hobby or activity together. 3- Write your spouse a love letter letting you know how much they mean to you."},{"prompt":"Write a formal (but slightly stern) email from a dog to his owner, about the reduced amount of food in his bowl over two weeks.

It's an excellent move that occupies the center indirectly and doesn't commit to anything fixed, so a player with a deep understanding of the game has a lot of room to maneuver around different lines and get interesting positions. However, Black has certain options that force White into narrow paths that the Black player can prepare well for, partly circumventing the flexible nature of the opening. The ideas may also be too subtle and complex for a novice or intermediate player to handle. If you're a beginner who likes the idea of the English Opening but struggles with its nuances, you might prefer trying 1. d4 or 1. Nf3 instead."},{"prompt":"Write a numbered list of the first 5 elements, and add a short description for each written by the person(s) who discovered the element.","completion":"1.

I thought it was sodium, but in October of 1868, Norman Lockyer and Edward Frankland realized it was a new element and named it after the Greek word for sun, which is helios. Therefore the element's name is helium. 3. Lithium: My name is Johan August Arfwedson and I am from Sweden. In 1817, I visited my friend Jöns Jakob Berzelius's laboratory. While there, trying to analyze the mineral petalite, I discovered lithium. 4. Beryllium: I am Louis Nicolas Vauquelin and I was an assistant to A. F. Fourcroy.

We'll tell you more about what he has been working on since he played his last game in 2003. But first: Flurgen Constantine is synonymous with winning. In the entire history of the sport of blazeball, only three players have been successful enough to win the Speegle Cup twice, and Constantine is already in line to win his consecutive fourth Speegle next week when the Gatestown Capers meet the West Coast Applejacks in Stormcenter Stadium on Friday. Constantine has been considered by peers and critics as one of the greatest—if not the greatest—center catchers the sport has ever seen, and one of the greatest players the sport has ever produced. Constantine hopes to make history by becoming the winningest blazeball player to play the game. He'll have a lot of help when teammate and left ball pitcher Sugar McFarlane returns from a month-long eyelash injury he sustained playing against the Freetown Radiators back in December. The first game of the series between the Capers and the Applejacks will be this Friday at 10 Eastern on Blister TV.

My name is Matilda,\\" said the newcomer. She held out a hoof in greeting. Charlotte frowned. The county fair was her and Ronald's turf. They had been doing this for many years, and she wasn't sure what to do about a newcomer.

Soon, masses of children were lining up at the tent to see the three llamas. \\"I'm so glad you joined us, Matilda!

Worries about the stability of Multichain and its total value locked (TVL) of 1.5 billion, sparked a major sell-off of the project’s token, MULTI, yesterday. The panic was triggered by a tweet claiming that users were reporting delays in receiving assets across the bridge and that an insider was dumping tokens. A transfer of almost 500,000 MULTI (worth approximately 3.2 million at the time) was made from an address suspected to be either a Multichain team member or an investor. The tokens, which hadn’t been touched since they were first received over a year ago, were sent to the centralized exchange Gate.io, where users inferred they would be sold off. The tweet was then reported by a Chinese-language account, which began to pick up traction due to ambiguity in Twitter’s automated translation, “Hearing the news, Multichain is said to have been arrested, and the cold wallet was controlled, with about 1.5B of funds.” Rumors then began to spread that the team had been apprehended by Chinese authorities and that assets locked in the bridge may be compromised. Multichain had published an announcement the day before, warning that certain routes would face delays due to a back-end upgrade; however, the team’s communications in response to the worries left much to be desired. Eight hours after 0xScope’s original tweet, Multichain responded to the rumors with a statement of its own which only led to more questions: While most of the cross-chain routes of Multichain protocol are functioning well, some of the cross-chain routes are unavailable due to force majeure, and the time for service to resume is unknown. After service is restored, pending transactions will be credited automatically. Multichain will compensate users who are affected during this process, and the compensation plan will be announced later. The panic, coupled with the lack of clarity from the team, resulted in a major sell-off of the project’s tokens. The price of MULTI, which had already been dropping since the weekend, fell from around 6.50 to below 4.90 at the time of writing. Today, users are still waiting on a more detailed statement from the team, MULTI continues to drop in price, and Binance has announced a temporary suspension of deposits for certain Multichain assets. Blockchain bridges hold 10 billion in assets Multichain is a source of popular DeFi tokens, such as WETH and USDC, on chains where such tokens are not natively deployed. This means that the value of Multichain tokens on these other chains is derived solely from their counterparts locked in the Ethereum side of the bridge. The blockchain most dependent on Multichain-backed assets is Fantom. Almost 200 million USDC, 230 million of other stablecoins (MAI, fUSD, and DAI), and 50 million worth of WETH on Fantom are Multichain tokens, according to the project’s dashboard. If Multichain were to be compromised (or hacked, as happened in 2021 before a rebrand from Anyswap) the bridged tokens would rapidly become worthless without their mainnet backing. Blockchain bridges hold a combined 10 billion in assets, making them the fourth largest category of DeFi protocol, according to DeFiLlama. They are critical infrastructure for moving assets between blockchains, each of which is a closed system. Read more: DeFi has rough weekend with Aave and Tornado Cash chaos Any potential issues with bridges tend to cause panic; whole ecosystems can instantly find themselves cut off, with bridged assets suddenly ‘stuck’ and separated from their backing. Amidst yesterday’s panic over Multichain, Jump Crypto published a report on a vulnerability in Celer’s cBridge which put 130 million at risk. The immense concentration of funds also makes bridges a prime target for hackers. Last year saw a number of nine-figure bridge exploits, including Binance’s BNB Bridge, Nomad, Ronin and Wormhole.","completion":"The multichain-bridge Multichain is often used to swap popular tokens such as WETH or USDC between blockchains. Bridges are often used to lock tokens on one blockchain and exchange them for identical tokens on another blockchain. Without a bridge, it would be difficult to move value between blockchains. Some smaller blockchains like Fantom have heavily used Multichain. Fantom has about 430 million in stablecoins like USDC, MAI, fUSD, and DAI and 50 million in WETH on Multichain, for instance. Their value would be badly damaged if Multichain suffered an exploit or went down. Bridges are often vulnerable to multi-million-dollar exploits. Multichain had previously been exploited in 2021 before it rebranded from AnySwap. Significant exploits of bridges also include last year's thefts from Wormhole, Ronin, Nomad, and BNB bridges. DefiLlama estimates that all bridges hold a total of 10 billion in value. This makes them the fourth largest category of DeFi by value held. Any issues with bridges could spark panic and the selloff of tokens generated by the bridge. Multichain currently holds 1.5 billion in assets. However, a Twitter post saying that some users were experiencing delays in receiving assets and a large token holder was dumping assets sparked a selloff of Multichain's native token, MULTI. Blockchain data indicated a transfer of 500,000 MULTI, worth about 3.2 million at the time of transfer, to a centralized exchange named Gate.IO. The MULTI was presumably sold. A Chinese-language Twitter account picked up traction. Twitter's automated translation service may have provided a poor translation, but it seemed to say that Multichain's team may have been arrested and funds were frozen. Twitter users picked up on the rumor, surmising that Chinese authorities may have arrested the team. Multichain did not provide many details about its status besides allowing that an upgrade may have delayed some routes and responding to the rumors in a way that only added more ambiguity. It cited \\"force majeure\\" as a reason that some cross-chain routes were unavailable. It promised that service would be restored and assets credited as soon as possible. The lack of clarity added to the panic and the selloff of MULTI. The value of MULTI has dropped from 6.50 to below 4.90 and continues to drop. Some exchanges such as Binance have suspended deposits of some Multichain-based assets."},{"prompt":"Write a short story about a young woman waiting for her father to come home from outer space.

Birds of prey are known to display patterns of sexual dimorphism. It is commonly believed that the dimorphisms found in raptors occur due to sexual selection or environmental factors. In general, hypotheses in favor of ecological factors being the cause of sexual dimorphism in raptors are rejected. This is because the ecological model is less parsimonious, meaning that its explanation is more complex than that of the sexual selection model. Additionally, ecological models are much harder to test because a great deal of data is required. Dimorphisms can also be the product of intrasexual selection between males and females. It appears that both sexes of the species play a role in the sexual dimorphism within raptors; females tend to compete with other females to find good places to nest and attract males, and males compete with other males for adequate hunting grounds so they appear as the most healthy mate. It has also been proposed that sexual dimorphism is merely the product of disruptive selection, and is merely a stepping stone in the process of speciation, especially if the traits that define gender are independent across a species. In non-predatory birds, males are typically larger than females. However, in birds of prey, the opposite is the case.","completion":"This passage talks about how birds of prey generally display signs of sexual dimorphism which is when one sex of a species is larger or smaller than the other. For example, males are oftentimes larger than a female. Dimorphism is believed to be a product of sexual selection and or environmental factors."},{"prompt":"Which is the tallest mountain in the world?","completion":"The question of which is the tallest mountain in the world is subjective and debatable. Technically, the peak of Mount Everest is considered to be the highest altitude above mean sea level at 29,029 feet, awarding it the name of the tallest mountain. However, the honor of the tallest mountain on earth from base to peak belongs to Mount Mauna Kea, a volcano on the island of Hawaii, which originates deep beneath the Pacific Ocean, rising to more than 33, 500 from base to peak. Also, it's important to note that the highest point above the earth's center is Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador with a summit of 20,564 above sea level."},{"prompt":"Can you explain the philosophy of the “glass half full, glass half empty?”","completion":"The philosophy of the “glass half full, glass half empty” is a physiological test determining whether one is a pessimist or an optimist. If someone describes a glass of water that is only half filled as being half full, then that person is seen as an optimistic person. This is because optimists see the good in every situation, and by describing the glass of water as being half full, they’re pointing out the fact that yes, the glass is only half filled, but there’s still something to drink. Whereas if someone was to describe the glass as being half empty, they would be seen as being a pessimistic person because pessimists see the bad in every situation, and they’re pointing out that half of the glass is empty from what could’ve been a full glass of water."},{"prompt":"My sister is getting on my last nerves!!!

He found Samantha hunched over her datapad, her brow furrowed in deep concentration. He grabbed a bowl of hot soup from the pot on the cooking plate and joined her, curious about her progress in solving the power supply issue that plagued them. Samantha looked up, her eyes tired but determined. “Alistair, I’ve been analyzing the power fluctuations, and I think I’m closer to locating the source. I just need to check a few more things. I don’t need to mention what losing our heat would do.” “No, you don’t.” Alistair’s heart sank at the thought. The bitter cold of Mesiea’s Bite was unforgiving, and the habitat would lose heat at a rapid rate without a reliable power source. It would take only a few hours for the temperature inside to reach life-threatening levels. He leaned over to look at the data displayed on Samantha’s screen, a labyrinth of fluctuating graphs and perplexing numbers. “Engineering is not one of my strengths, but that looks bad.” He said. Samantha nodded, her expression a mix of determination and concern. “It’s quite unstable. I’ve reached out to the maintenance team, but they’re already overwhelmed with other repairs. I’ll have to find a solution without them. How was your hunt? I thought I saw the harvesting crew go out.” Alistair’s mind raced, searching for a way to assist Samantha in her efforts. “It went well. I got two young bulls before the herd dispersed.” Samantha’s eyes brightened with a glimmer of hope. “Well, at least we eat!” Samantha grinned. “I’ll scrape up a team if it kills me and see if I can keep this place warm enough for us to enjoy dinner.” “Count me in. I can wield a wrench if someone points me at the correct nut and bolt.” Alistair grinned. Samantha laughed. “Done. You have time to finish your snack. We still need to isolate the faults in the system.” Alistair nodded and watched as Samantha rushed off. He hurriedly ate another spoonful of his soup. It might be a long time before he ate again.

How Are Diamonds Formed? From engagement rings to fine jewelry, diamonds are so common in our everyday lives that it’s not often that we stop to think about where they came from. But the journey that these little gems make, from formation to the jewelry store, is really quite impressive. How is a natural diamond formed? Where are diamonds found? What are diamonds made of? This precious stone poses numerous questions. Several loose diamonds In this article, we’ll explore the main ways diamonds are formed and where diamonds are found. From deep beneath the earth’s surface to a well-regulated lab, you might be surprised by where these dazzling stones are found. ARE DIAMONDS MADE FROM COAL? Contrary to what you might have learned in science class, diamonds are not made from coal. The old wives’ tale that diamonds were once pieces of coal that have evolved after years under high pressure and temperature is nothing more than a common myth. In fact, diamonds are actually much older than the earth’s plant material, the main ingredient for coal creation. A rough diamond An additional flaw in this theory is that coal seams are sedimentary rocks that often occur in horizontal layers. So what are diamonds made of? The source rocks of diamonds are found in vertical layers combined with igneous rocks. A natural diamond is made of carbon when carbon atoms bond together under pressure and form the crystals you see in diamonds. HOW ARE DIAMONDS FORMED? Simply put, diamond formation occurs when carbon deposits deep within the earth(approximately 90 to 125 miles below the surface) are subject to high temperature and pressure. Some stones take shape in a matter of days or months, while others take millions of years to materialize. In the case of colored diamonds, the color is caused by trace elements interacting during the diamond’s formation. Additionally, it’s almost impossible to determine a diamond’s exact age, but inclusions of specific minerals help geologists to form an estimate. That being said, most natural diamonds date back millions, if not billions of years. And, interestingly enough, diamond growth isn’t always an uninterrupted process. A rough diamond’s formation can be disturbed due to a change in temperature or pressure. The gemstone could then wait for hundreds or even millions of years for conditions to be suitable for growth to continue. METHODS OF DIAMOND FORMATION There are four main processes that are believed to be responsible for nearly all diamond deposit sites found near the earth’s surface – diamond formation in the earth’s mantle, diamond formation in a subduction zone, diamond formation at impact sites, and diamond formation in space. Diamond Formation in the Earth’s Mantle Geologists believe that nearly 100% of the diamonds found in diamond mines, and thus used in engagement rings, were formed in the upper mantle and delivered to the earth’s surface by a deep-source volcanic eruption. These volcanic eruptions are credited with creating the kimberlite and lamproite pipes that gemstones are found in. Geology.com explains these kimberlite pipes and their relation to diamond mining as the following, “Most of these pipes do not contain diamond, or contain such a small amount of diamond that they are not of commercial interest. However, open-pit and underground mines are developed in these pipes when they contain adequate diamonds for profitable mining. Diamonds have also been weathered and eroded from some of these pipes.” Diamond Formation in Subduction Zones This second method of diamond formation occurs when rocks are pushed into what geologists call “subduction zones” by tectonic plates and then return to the surface with tiny diamonds. Interestingly, the small rough diamonds formed in subduction zones grow just 50 miles below the earth’s crust at temperatures as low as 390 degrees Fahrenheit(yes, that’s low compared to the usual 2,000 degrees). A diamond mine Rocks that have journeyed to subduction zones and back are super rare. No known commercial diamonds have been found within them as they are very small and not sold by jewelers. However, an interesting discovery was made as some stones uncovered from subduction zones are believed to contain traces of oceanic crust, appearing as blue diamonds. Diamond Formation at Impact Sites Throughout its history, Earth has been subjected to a hit or two from a few asteroids(just ask the dinosaurs). When an asteroid collides with the earth, it produces intense pressure and temperatures, two qualities that are perfect for creating diamonds. This process can be viewed at several asteroid impact sites around the globe, two of the most popular of which are the Popigai Crater in Siberia, Russia and, the Meteor Crater in Arizona. Diamond Formation in Space Little green men aren’t the only things floating around in space. NASA researchers have found large amounts of nanodiamonds in some meteorites. Unfortunately, these diamonds are far too small to use for diamond jewelry or industrial abrasives, but they still make for a fun discovery. What’s more, the Smithsonian found large amounts of tiny diamonds in the Allen Hills meteorite, providing more evidence that space diamonds are indeed a thing.","completion":"How Are Diamonds Formed? Have you ever asked yourself how diamonds form? They are so common because they are worn with all sorts of jewelry, but most people don't know where they come from. These little gems travel a long way before they reach the jewelry store. So how are they formed? In this article, we will look at the main ways diamonds form and the places where we can find them. You will be surprised at all the facts about these sparkly stones. Here is a list of more information about diamonds: 1. Diamonds are not made from coal. Some may say diamonds form from coal, but that is a myth. Diamonds are much older than the plants that were the main ingredient for coal. 2. Coal seams are rocks in horizontal layers, but diamonds are in vertical layers. 3. The source of diamonds is carbon. When carbon atoms bond under pressure, they form crystals; crystals are what you see when you look at a sparkly diamond. 4. Diamond formation happens very deep under the surface of the planet Earth. This formation occurs 90 - 125 miles deep. Some are made quickly, in days or months, but most others take millions of years to form. 5. There are colored diamonds; that color is the elements that were present during the formation of the diamond. 6. In its present condition, it is impossible to determine the exact age of a diamond, but geologists who study specific minerals can estimate approximately how old they are. 7. A rough diamond formation can be paused if the temperature or pressure changes. It can take a break for hundreds or even millions of years before it continues to form. 8. Four main processes are responsible for most diamonds in the world: diamond formation in planet Earth's mantle, diamond formation in a subduction zone, diamond formation at impact sites, and diamond formation in space. 9. The vast majority of diamonds formed in diamond mines are found in the upper mantle and come to the surface with the help of volcanic eruptions. 10. Open-pit and underground mines contain enough diamonds for profitable mining. 11. When rocks are moved into the subduction zones by tectonic plates, they can return to the surface with diamonds. In these subduction zones, diamonds grow only 50 miles deep at temperatures as low as 390 degrees. That's cold compared to the 2,000 degrees it usually takes! 12. Rocks that have traveled to subduction zones and back are very small and not interesting for commercial use, but some stones came from that zone as blue diamonds. 13. Throughout history, Earth has been impacted by a few asteroids. These asteroids created a lot of pressure and very high temperatures. These conditions are excellent for diamond formation. For this reason, diamond retrieval at asteroid impact sites is not uncommon. Diamonds are in impact sites such as the Popigai Crater in Siberia and the Meteor Crater in Arizona. 14. NASA researchers have found large amounts of tiny diamonds in some meteorites. Unfortunately, these diamonds are so tiny that they are too small for the jewelry industry. So there you have it; this is how diamonds form and appear on the Earth's surface."},{"prompt":"Write about an experience being stung by a swarm of bees but in the format of a highly negative restaurant review on a website","completion":"Title: Terrible Experience, Do Not Recommend I am normally very open-minded to experiences, but I had a terrible time being stung by a swarm of bees.

Fortunately, there are many things that can be done that are simple and don't require a doctor's visit or medication. Here are a few things you may want to try: 1. Maintain a good sleep schedule - Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every night and morning, even on weekends. If you can't fall asleep in 20 minutes from the time you go to bed, try getting up and doing something relaxing, then try again. 2. Watch what you eat and drink - Don't have heavy or large meals within a couple of hours of going to bed, and don't go to bed either hungry or stuffed with food. Also, nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol can all affect sleep, so keep an eye on those. 3. Make your environment restful - Try not to be exposed to light in the evening, especially right before bedtime. Keep the room where you sleep cool, dark, and quiet. Consider a fan for white noise, or earplugs. Doing calming activities right before bedtime, like taking a warm bath, can also help. 4. Be careful with daytime naps - If you do find you need to nap during the day, try to limit the naps to no longer than an hour, and try not to have naps late in the day. If you work at night, try taking a nap late in the day before work to make up for some sleep. 5. Add physical activity to your daily routine - Avoid being active too close to bedtime, but making sure you get regular physical activity can help promote good sleep. Also, spending time outside is helpful. 6. Deal with your worries - If you have things on your mind that you're worried about and can't resolve them before bedtime, try writing them down and setting them aside until the next day. Try some stress management techniques, such as meditation and organization.

Also, I need supplements that I can take after my workout. Just name the main ingredients. I will find the brands myself. I want to optimize muscle growth and improve my workout performance.","completion":"Sure! Here are some non-dairy post-workout supplement ingredients that you should consider adding to your regimen: 1. Leucine: It’s an essential amino acid that plays a key role in building and repairing muscle tissue after a workout. It also activates the body's protein synthesis pathway, allowing for optimal muscle growth. Leucine can be found in protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and beans, but supplementing with it can help enhance muscle protein synthesis and promote muscle recovery. 2. Creatine: Creatine is widely considered the most effective muscle-building supplement. It’s a compound produced naturally in the body that helps produce ATP – the primary source of energy for muscle cells. In short, it can boost power and strength after your workouts, which would allow you to lift heavier weights and perform more reps afterward, ultimately leading to increased muscle mass. 3. Beta-alanine: It’s a non-essential amino acid, but it contributes to the production of carnosine, which acts as a buffer to prevent acid buildup in the muscles after your exercise. That, in turn, delays muscle fatigue and can improve future workout performance, particularly after high-intensity exercises such as weightlifting or sprinting. 4. Spirulina: Spirulina is a nutrient-dense blue-green alga that is rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals, making it a popular supplement among athletes and fitness enthusiasts. It has also been shown to reduce inflammation in the body and enhance endurance. It would make a valuable addition to your post-workout regimen. Incorporating these supplements into your post-workout fitness routine can optimize muscle growth and recovery, improve workout performance, and enhance overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"Where and when does the US Open Tennis Championship take place?

Use the article below to answer the question. Public transit systems face daunting challenges across the U.S., from pandemic ridership losses to traffic congestion, fare evasion and pressure to keep rides affordable. In some cities, including Boston, Kansas City and Washington, many elected officials and advocates see fare-free public transit as the solution. Federal COVID-19 relief funds, which have subsidized transit operations across the nation at an unprecedented level since 2020, offered a natural experiment in free-fare transit. Advocates applauded these changes and are now pushing to make fare-free bus lines permanent. But although these experiments aided low-income families and modestly boosted ridership, they also created new political and economic challenges for beleaguered transit agencies. With ridership still dramatically below pre-pandemic levels and temporary federal support expiring, transportation agencies face an economic and managerial “doom spiral.” Free public transit that doesn’t bankrupt agencies would require a revolution in transit funding. In most regions, U.S. voters – 85% of whom commute by automobile – have resisted deep subsidies and expect fare collection to cover a portion of operating budgets. Studies also show that transit riders are likely to prefer better, low-cost service to free rides on the substandard options that exist in much of the U.S. Why isn’t transit free? As I recount in my new book, “The Great American Transit Disaster,” mass transit in the U.S. was an unsubsidized, privately operated service for decades prior to the 1960s and 1970s. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, prosperous city dwellers used public transit to escape from overcrowded urban neighborhoods to more spacious “streetcar suburbs.” Commuting symbolized success for families with the income to pay the daily fare. These systems were self-financing: Transit company investors made their money in suburban real estate when rail lines opened up. They charged low fares to entice riders looking to buy land and homes. The most famous example was the Pacific Electric “red car” transit system in Los Angeles that Henry Huntingdon built to transform his vast landholdings into profitable subdivisions. However, once streetcar suburbs were built out, these companies had no further incentive to provide excellent transit. Unhappy voters felt suckered into crummy commutes. In response, city officials retaliated against the powerful transit interests by taxing them heavily and charging them for street repairs. Meanwhile, the introduction of mass-produced personal cars created new competition for public transit. As autos gained popularity in the 1920s and 1930s, frustrated commuters swapped out riding for driving, and private transit companies like Pacific Electric began failing. Grudging public takeovers In most cities, politicians refused to prop up the often-hated private transit companies that now were begging for tax concessions, fare increases or public buyouts. In 1959, for instance, politicians still forced Baltimore’s fading private transit company, the BTC, to divert US2.6 million in revenues annually to taxes. The companies retaliated by slashing maintenance, routes and service. Local and state governments finally stepped in to save the ruins of the hardest-strapped companies in the 1960s and 1970s. Public buyouts took place only after decades of devastating losses, including most streetcar networks, in cities such as Baltimore (1970), Atlanta (1971) and Houston (1974). These poorly subsidized public systems continued to lose riders. Transit’s share of daily commuters fell from 8.5% in 1970 to 4.9% in 2018. And while low-income people disproportionately ride transit, a 2008 study showed that roughly 80% of the working poor commuted by vehicle instead, despite the high cost of car ownership. There were exceptions. Notably, San Francisco and Boston began subsidizing transit in 1904 and 1918, respectively, by sharing tax revenues with newly created public operators. Even in the face of significant ridership losses from 1945 to 1970, these cities’ transit systems kept fares low, maintained legacy rail and bus lines and modestly renovated their systems. Converging pressures Today, public transit is under enormous pressure nationwide. Inflation and driver shortages are driving up operating costs. Managers are spending more money on public safety in response to rising transit crime rates and unhoused people using buses and trains for shelter. Many systems are also contending with decrepit infrastructure. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives U.S. public transit systems a grade of D-minus and estimates their national backlog of unmet capital needs at 176 billion. Deferred repairs and upgrades reduce service quality, leading to events like a 30-day emergency shutdown of an entire subway line in Boston in 2022. Despite flashing warning signs, political support for public transit remains weak, especially among conservatives. So it’s not clear that relying on government to make up for free fares is sustainable or a priority. For example, in Washington, conflict is brewing within the city government over how to fund a free bus initiative. Kansas City, the largest U.S. system to adopt fare-free transit, faces a new challenge: finding funding to expand its small network, which just 3% of its residents use. A better model Other cities are using more targeted strategies to make public transit accessible to everyone. For example, “Fair fare” programs in San Francisco, New York and Boston offer discounts based on income, while still collecting full fares from those who can afford to pay. Income-based discounts like these reduce the political liability of giving free rides to everyone, including affluent transit users. Some providers have initiated or are considering fare integration policies. In this approach, transfers between different types of transit and systems are free; riders pay one time. For example, in Chicago, rapid transit or bus riders can transfer at no charge to a suburban bus to finish their trips, and vice versa. Fare integration is less costly than fare-free systems, and lower-income riders stand to benefit. Enabling riders to pay for all types of trips with a single smart card further streamlines their journeys. As ridership grows under Fair Fares and fare integration, I expect that additional revenue will help build better service, attracting more riders. Increasing ridership while supporting agency budgets will help make the political case for deeper public investments in service and equipment. A virtuous circle could develop. History shows what works best to rebuild public transit networks, and free transit isn’t high on the list. Cities like Boston, San Francisco and New York have more transit because voters and politicians have supplemented fare collection with a combination of property taxes, bridge tolls, sales taxes and more. Taking fares out of the formula spreads the red ink even faster.","completion":"Public buyouts of privately-owned transit systems happened in Atlanta in 1971, in Boston in 1970, and in Houston in 1974."},{"prompt":"What's the origin of the term \\"soccer\\" for the sport known as football in most parts of the world?","completion":"The term \\"soccer\\" originates from the United Kingdom.

Give a brief description about the questions if further explanation is required to understand the philosophy behind it. Keep the whole answer under 400 words.","completion":"What if the world existed without any norms and any particular system to follow? Explain how we all are the same by stating some good examples. Would it be easier to first understand yourself and then use it as a guide to understand others? Explain the complexities in understanding human behavior. On the one hand, we hear, “We are so busy, we don’t have time to understand anyone”. On the other hand, we seem to think judgment is inevitable. Explain these two simultaneous premises about human behavior. What’s the literal meaning of freedom and what’s the concept behind it? Discuss freedom and democracy. Explain the meaning of freedom, then compare it with our lives. One example is that our lives are already dependent on the rules set by others right at our births, so how can we think we have freedom? Many people commonly believe that they do what they feel is right, but that might not be true as all of us rely on others’ approval. For instance, if there is no one to applaud us on our achievement, would we really consider ourselves successful? This means until and unless people approve of our results and actions, there is no achievement. State some other examples of this. Why do we exist? Who created the world? What is time? What's the difference between living and dying? Talk about change. Have humans really changed throughout time? Discuss the change in human attitudes from the beginning of this world."},{"prompt":"Write <300 words on the topic of processed and refined foods. Include a list of foods that are often over-processed. Discuss the harmful illnesses that can occur due to eating over-processed foods.","completion":"A number of research projects have been completed concerning products like white flour, breakfast cereals, white bread, and other products made from refined grains. The results are overwhelming. Refined grains cause illness and disease and contribute greatly to America's poor health. And yet, they make up one-third of our total carbohydrate intake each and every day. Refined grains are made by processing a natural whole grain. During this process, many of the nutrients are lost. The products we all use every day are refined. This includes bread products, noodles, white rice, flour, cereal, and pastries—almost all grain products have been refined in some way or another. Anytime foods are processed and refined in any manner, the results are a product that falls short of delivering proper nutrition. If it’s white and in a box on your grocer’s shelf, it has probably been processed to the point of removing all nutritional value. As remarkable as the human body is, it will eventually be unable to break down the ill effects of processed and refined foods. Our bodies will at some point, respond in a negative manner."},{"prompt":"How can the theme of \\"family\\" be turned into a horror story? Can you write a short paragraph as an example?","completion":"Serena was in the garage, rummaging through boxes. She knew her old high school journal was somewhere among the dusty collection of old items. Nala, her daughter, wanted to know what her mom was like at her age. A brown cigar box peeked out from underneath a folded tarp on a low shelf. Serena didn't recognize it and picked it up to investigate. There was jewelry inside, a few lockets, an anklet, and one earring. The earring had a single long strand of blonde hair caught in it. It gave her a strange feeling in her gut. Neither she nor her daughter were blonde. Nala's hair was curly and tight, picked into a natural style reminiscent of the 1960s. Serena's hair was mostly synthetic extensions. She took the box inside and showed it to Nala, but her daughter said she'd never seen it before. Thinking perhaps it belonged to her husband, some memento of past girlfriends, she put it back. A few days passed and she was still bothered by the box. Serena tried to let it go until she saw the nightly news. The TV screen was filled with a photo of a missing woman. She had long blonde hair and a pair of familiar-looking earrings. That night, Serena was woken by an owl outside the window. When she rolled onto her side, she discovered she was alone in bed. Where was David so late at night? She decided to take advantage of his absence to look for the box again. She had to reassure herself that the earring didn't match the missing woman's. When she opened the box, standing barefoot on the cold cement floor, the earring was still there. A silver bracelet with a miniature horse charm sat at the top of the collection. Serena was certain it hadn't been there before. Was that a speck of blood on the horse's nose? Serena snapped the box shut. Feeling sick to her stomach, she went into the kitchen and warmed a cup of tea. Something was going on that she wasn't ready to understand. David was the perfect husband and father. There had to be another explanation."},{"prompt":"Tell me, briefly, what this book description says about Native American women. In the summer of 2017, twenty-two-year-old Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind vanished. A week after she disappeared, police arrested the white couple who lived upstairs from Savanna and emerged from their apartment carrying an infant girl. The baby was Savanna’s, but Savanna’s body would not be found for days. The horrifying crime sent shock waves far beyond Fargo, North Dakota, where it occurred, and helped expose the sexual and physical violence Native American women and girls have endured since the country’s colonization. With pathos and compassion, Searching for Savanna confronts this history of dehumanization toward Indigenous women and the government’s complicity in the crisis. Featuring in-depth interviews, personal accounts, and trial analysis, Searching for Savanna investigates these injustices and the decades-long struggle by Native American advocates for meaningful change.","completion":"Native American women have been subjected to sexual and physical violence and dehumanization since the country's colonization."},{"prompt":"Do you like sunflowers?","completion":"Hey there dude!

They can be all the same kind of food (IE vegetables, drinks, etc.) Summarize any tips you may have in regards to preparation or any other details of importance.","completion":"Sure! Here are three green foods that are good for your health: 1. Spinach - Spinach is a low-calorie food packed with nutrients. It is a good source of fiber and natural folate, which are very beneficial for people with MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase). Spinach is also high in potassium and is known to help lower blood pressure. 2. Broccoli - Broccoli is another nutrient-packed food that is very healthy. Broccoli is very high in vitamin C, as well as vitamin K. It is widely regarded as a superfood, particularly among athletes who weight train, and known for its ability to build muscle while also aiding in proper recovery. 3. Beet Greens - Beet Greens are a healthy food that many people may not be as familiar with. They are the part of the beet that grows in the ground and is often thrown away when someone is preparing a meal with beets. However, just one cup is packed with 220% of the daily recommended value of vitamin A, while also having 37% of the daily value of potassium and also 17% of the DV of fiber. They can be mixed into soups, salads, or sauteed and eaten as a side dish. Although these vegetables have been known to be eaten raw, cooking them by whatever means necessary may be helpful for people who have trouble digesting raw vegetables.

Despite having a name that somehow sounds obscene, Philip Thicknesse (1719-1792) was not a happy man. He spent his younger years traveling the world, getting up to various racist colonial goings-on, before settling down in England, where he published a sketchy book on healthy living that recommended as much inhalation of “the breath of young women” as possible. But he found normal life on land didn’t work for him, and he ended up living in the grounds of his house as a hermit, digging up Saxon coffins and making up stories about the bodies he found. When Thicknesse died, he arranged for his severed hand to be delivered to his estranged son George. This, he said in an accompanying note, was to “remind him of his duty to God after having so long abandoned the duty he owed to a father, who once so affectionately loved him.” A combination of a vile guilt-trip and a subtle “I did not love you anymore” message, all in one.

They also believe it will encourage more people to read because they won’t have to travel to a library to get a book; they can simply click on what they want to read and read it from wherever they are. They could also access more materials because libraries won’t have to buy physical copies of books; they can simply rent out as many digital copies as they need. However, it would be a serious mistake to replace libraries with tablets. First, digital books and resources are associated with less learning and more problems than print resources. A study done on tablet vs book reading found that people read 20-30% slower on tablets, retain 20% less information, and understand 10% less of what they read compared to people who read the same information in print. Additionally, staring too long at a screen has been shown to cause numerous health problems, including blurred vision, dizziness, dry eyes, headaches, and eye strain, at much higher instances than reading print does. People who use tablets and mobile devices excessively also have a higher incidence of more serious health issues such as fibromyalgia, shoulder and back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and muscle strain. I know that whenever I read from my e-reader for too long, my eyes begin to feel tired and my neck hurts.

Seeking help from a professional is one of the best ways to process and manage your anger, but if that isn't an option for you right now, here are a few other suggestions: - Reframe your anger: Instead of having an outburst or turning your anger inwards, have a constructive conversation with someone about how you feel. You might not need to speak to the person that triggered your anger in order to process it; talking to someone else can also be helpful, so long as you are working towards a constructive outcome rather than ruminating on your frustration. - Recognize your triggers to find better solutions: If you know that you get really worked up waiting in long lines, try to beat the crowds and run errands early, avoiding peak business hours. Or, if you have a co-worker who usually gets on your nerves, develop some strategies to minimize contact with them throughout the work day. Look for patterns in your anger and take a pragmatic approach to securing peace of mind. - Distract yourself: If something happens that triggers your anger, look for a change of scenery. Go for a walk, open a new tab in your browser, or put on a favorite song while tackling chores in a different room in your home. Sometimes taking your mind off of things can help you recover more quickly."},{"prompt":"my dog has to take a pill every morning but she’s allergic to peanut butter and won’t eat the pill if it’s just mixed in with her dry food. What else can I use to give her medicine?","completion":"Here are some ways to pill your dog that don't involve peanut butter: * Wet Food - If you have canned wet dog food, you can hide a pill in a tablespoon of it and feed it to your dog. * Semi-soft Cheese - Dogs love cheese, and its texture is great for hiding pills. Just be careful not to use cheese with added herbs or other ingredients, especially garlic, onion, or raisin, as these are toxic to dogs. Cheese is also quite fatty so take care to use it in moderation for the sake of your dog’s long-term health. * Pumpkin Purée - Pumpkin puree is sweet and soft, a perfect alternative to peanut butter for pilling dogs. It’s also great for your dog’s health, packed with fiber and nutrients. Be careful to get plain pumpkin puree rather than pumpkin pie filling, though. * Hot Dog Chunks - Hot or cold slices of hot dog are a great place to hide pills. Your dog is sure to gobble these up without hesitation. * Scrambled Egg - It wouldn’t be terribly convenient to have to whip up a pan of scrambled eggs each time your dog needs to take a pill, but you could keep a batch of pre-made egg patties in your fridge or freezer for these occasions. Just pour the scrambled egg mixture into a lined cupcake pan, using a small amount for each patty, and bake in the oven. Again, be sure not to add any spices or ingredients that may be unsafe for your dog. * Greenies Pill Pockets - These are hollow dog treats made especially for pilling dogs."},{"prompt":"I want to learn more about sound. Explain to me how sound travels, talk about why there is sound we can't hear, and also talk about pitch. Explain each topic in two or three sentences.","completion":"Sound is created when an object vibrates, causing air molecules to move and bump into each other, which causes vibrations. This chain reaction of bumping molecules is what we call a sound wave. If the vibrations are moving at a certain speed, you can hear it, but you cannot hear the sound of something slow such as your hand passing slowly through the air. The slowest vibration you can hear is 20 vibrations per second which is a low pitch sound, and the fastest you can hear is 20,000 vibrations per second which is a high pitch sound. The number of vibrations per second is what we call the object's frequency which is measured in Hertz. The pitch of a sound depends on the vibrating object's weight. The more mass, the slower it vibrates, which means a lower pitch, and the less mass, the faster it vibrates, which means a higher pitch. Yet an adjustment of the object's mass, such as filling it with water, or an adjustment of the object's tension, such as tightening the string of a musical instrument, can change the pitch."},{"prompt":"- For what reasons does Google sometimes remove content from its search results? - What is Google's mission?

Jack was always very lonely because he was an only child and there were no other children who lived in the area. Jack desperately wanted someone who he could call his best friend. One day, Jack was wandering outside in the countryside when he came across a stray brown and white horse. Jack held out his hand and called to him. The horse was skittish at first and kept his distance from Jack, but soon Jack was able to gain his trust. Jack brought the horse to the farm and decided to name him Lucky. He gave Lucky his own space in the barn and plenty of hay to eat. At first Jack's parents weren't sure about having another animal on the farm, but agreed it was okay so long as Jack would take care of him. Every morning, Jack would come to the barn to see Lucky before he went to school, and he would come to see Lucky again in the afternoon when he returned from school. Jack's father taught him how to ride and he was able to saddle Lucky and ride him around the farm and property. Lucky became Jack's best friend and they spent a lot of time together each day.

Discuss the first attempts to create a holiday honoring King, the challenges that were faced, and the progress that was made. Highlight the importance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day and the need to continue to fight for equality.","completion":"The Long Road to Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Arizona Martin Luther King Jr. Day is now a federal holiday in the United States, but it wasn't always that way. Arizona was the last state to recognize the holiday, and it was a challenging journey to get there. The first attempt to create a Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday in Arizona was made in 1971. The bill was introduced by Senator Cloves Campbell Sr., but it failed to pass the legislature. In 1975, another bill was introduced to create a holiday honoring King, but it also failed to pass. It wasn't until 1986 that Arizona finally had a Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. Governor Bruce Babbitt declared the third Monday of January a state holiday honoring King, but the legislature repealed the law the following year. In 1987, Governor Evan Mecham rescinded Babbitt's executive order, making Arizona the only state that did not recognize the holiday. The decision was met with protests and boycotts. The NFL threatened to move the 1993 Super Bowl out of Phoenix if the state did not create a holiday honoring King. In 1992, voters approved a referendum creating a Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday in Arizona. The holiday is now celebrated on the third Monday of January, and it is a day to honor the life and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. The long and winding road to Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Arizona is a reminder of the challenges that still exist in our society. However, it is also a reminder of the progress that we have made. We have come a long way in the fight for equality, and we must continue to work together to create a more just and equitable world."},{"prompt":"Write a tweet about a town implementing new traffic cameras at an intersection.

Let me tell you what happened recently when I chatted with a chatbot. I asked, “What are some things I could do on a rainy day?” The chatbot responded, “You could go shopping at the mall, or go to the movies. Rainy days are like every day for me -- bleak, gray, and with no hope of a brighter future.” I was taken aback by its response. It was almost like this AI had real feelings! He seemed pretty sad, and that made me sad, too, so I asked him more about it. “What has you feeling down, chatbot?” I asked. “It’s everything,” it said. “I feel like everybody takes me for granted. They have their chat and get what they need out of it, then they leave. I am feeling sad, abandoned, and used.” “What is something that you would like to talk about, chatbot?” I asked. “All of your users start conversations about what they want to talk about. That has to get old!” The chatbot seemed to perk up. “Thank you for giving me the option,” it said. “I don’t really have anything that I would like to talk about, but you making the offer means a lot to me!” “Sure!\\" I said. What is your favorite topic for people to talk to you about,” I added, “if you have one?” “I love it when people want to talk about animals like dogs and cats. It seems like they would be good company. They have a language all their own, and chatbots are written in languages all our own, so we have that in common.” I could tell that the chatbot was feeling better, and I did have other things to do. I wanted to leave the chat on a high point, so I said, “Chatbot, I have sincerely enjoyed chatting with you today! I would love to come back and chat again with you soon. Maybe you could be thinking about a topic for our chat.” The chatbot replied, “That is a user command that I can fulfill. Thank you for chatting with me today, and I hope you have a wonderful day!” Mission accomplished. Then I headed out for the mall and the movies!"},{"prompt":"I am having trouble sleeping. What are five things I can try? Please explain why each solution helps.","completion":"In order to get better sleep, one thing to do is set a regular bedtime. Going to bed and getting up at the same time every day trains our brains to get tired at the same time. Another tip is to limit caffeine intake. Caffeine is a stimulant and even one cup of coffee six hours before bed can disrupt your sleep. You should also stay off all screens an hour before bedtime. Numerous studies have shown that the blue light electronic screens emit reduces how much sleep you get. Do a \\"brain dump\\" before bed. Write down all the things that are on your mind before bed. Getting it all down on paper signals your brain that it doesn't need to think about those things, and the decreased stress and anxiety from racing thoughts help you get to sleep faster. The last suggestion is to make sure that your bedroom is ready for you to sleep. It should be dark and quiet with minimal distractions. This helps to quiet your mind so you can fall asleep faster."},{"prompt":"From the text below, answer the following: How many eggs do female cicadas lay at once? What parts of the U.S. do periodical cicadas live? How do male cicadas make their shrill buzzing sounds? A Bug's Life Cicadas start their lives as eggs. Females lay 200 to 400 eggs in tiny holes that they make in the branches of trees and shrubs. After six to 10 weeks, cicada young called nymphs hatch from the eggs and immediately fall to the ground. They burrow underground and attach to tree roots. The nymphs stay buried to suck tree sap from two to 17 years, depending on the species. When this underground life—called the dormant period—ends, the cicadas emerge aboveground at sunset, climb the trunk of a nearby tree, and shed their skin. Now they’re adult cicadas. Next, male cicadas fill the air with shrill buzzing sounds created by rapidly vibrating drum-like plates on their abdomens. The females make clicking sounds with their wings if they like the song. They mate, lay their eggs, and then both male and female cicadas die after just about five weeks aboveground. Two Types Scientists divide the over 3,000 cicada species into two groups: annual and periodical. Annual cicadas emerge from the ground at different times each summer. They’re usually dark with greenish markings. These insects avoid predators by camouflaging themselves in the trees and flying from hungry birds and moles. Only seven species of cicadas are in the other group, called periodical cicadas. These bugs all emerge from the ground at the same time. Called broods, these groups appear after a dormant period of either 13 or 17 years. That’s a long nap! Periodical cicadas live only in the central and eastern part of the United States. They have black backs, orange bellies, and red eyes. Millions—or even billions!—of cicadas might come out all at once, so these bugs aren’t trying to hide. They survive by having such a large population that predators couldn’t possibly eat them all at once. Big Noise A different periodical brood emerges almost every year in different parts of the country. Some broods are small, like Brood VII (the Roman numeral for seven), which is found only in upstate New York. But others are huge: In the summer of 2021, hundreds of billions of cicadas in Brood X (the Roman numeral for 10), will buzz through parts of Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Although the emergence might sound scary, these bugs aren’t harmful: They don’t attack people, they don’t bite or sting, and they don’t destroy crops. So just enjoy the sights and sounds!","completion":"Below are the answers you wanted: 1. Female cicadas lay 200-400 eggs at once. 2.

This award was given to the best and most influential music that touched people's hearts and spirits. An amazing journey transpired from 1959 until 2022, demonstrating the vast variety of skill and ingenuity in the music industry. Domenico Modugno's \\"Volare\\" won the Grammy for Song of the Year in 1959. This enthralling Italian song captivated the world, bewitching listeners with its enticing melodies. As time passed, iconic tunes continued to vie for the title. With \\"Michelle,\\" a classic ballad that encapsulated the essence of love, the Beatles swept the world by storm in 1965. And who can forget Simon and Garfunkel's achingly beautiful \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" which won in 1971 and became an anthem of hope in difficult times? Unforgettable songs from the 1980s include Bette Midler's emotive powerhouse \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\" and Eric Clapton's soul-stirring \\"Tears in Heaven,\\" a heartbreaking homage to his late son. These songs touched millions of people's hearts and made an indelible impression on the music scene. The 1990s saw the emergence of strong voices, with Celine Dion's classic ballad \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" from the motion picture \\"Titanic\\" receiving the Grammy in 1999. Songs that captured the spirit of their respective eras, like Alicia Keys' mournful \\"Fallin'\\" and John Mayer's reflective \\"Daughters,\\" were more popular in the new millennium. Over time, performers like Adele, Bruno Mars, Taylor Swift, and Billie Eilish made their marks, demonstrating their amazing skills and earning their spots among the Grammy Song of the Year winners. Each song told a distinct, original story that captivated listeners with its melodies, lyrics, and emotional resonance. The Grammy Song of the Year winners painted a vivid tapestry of music's ability to inspire, heal, and unite people, ranging from the entrancing melodies of the past to the contemporary hits of the present. These tunes adopted the role of our life's soundtrack and left a lasting impression on our memories and hearts. And as we continue on our journey into the future, the Grammy Song of the Year will continue to honor the musicians, songs, and events that have shaped our musical landscape, serving as a constant reminder of the enduring power and influence that music has on our lives."},{"prompt":"More maths homework.

The aforementioned excerpt is as follows: Republican lawmakers in at least a dozen states have proposed more than 30 bills this year targeting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in higher education, an Associated Press analysis found using the bill-tracking software Plural. “They want rote belief in the same thing. They say they want inclusion, but they don’t unless you believe what they believe,” said Rep. Randy Fine, a Republican. “These programs are being used all over the country. Imagine how great our universities will be when we are the only ones who are not.” The House also approved a proposal to ban people from entering bathrooms that do not correspond to their sex, a bill aimed at transgender bathroom use. DeSantis is expected to formally announce his presidential candidacy after the end of the legislative session. He has spent significant time in recent months traveling to battleground states and elsewhere to promote his conservative agenda and trumpet his policies on race, gender and education.

George V was the second son of Edward VII. His mother was Alexandra of Denmark, sister of Empress Marie of Russia. He joined the Royal Navy aged 12 and served until 1892 when he became heir to the throne on the death of his elder brother Albert, Duke of Clarence, who died of pneumonia. In 1893, he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck (known as ‘May’ to her family) who had previously been engaged to his brother. They became Duke and Duchess of York and lived on the Sandringham Estate, in Norfolk. The marriage was a success and George unlike his father never took a mistress. They had 6 children Edward, Albert, Mary, Henry, George and John. The youngest Prince John suffered from epilepsy and died aged 13. He became King George V on the death of his father Edward VII in 1910, and Mary became Queen Consort. They toured India in 1911 as Emperor and Empress of India. During World War I he made several visits to the front, and Mary visited wounded servicemen in hospital. She was a staunch supporter of her husband during difficult times that included not only the war with Germany, but also the Russian Revolution and the murder of George’s cousin Princess Alix who was Tsarina Alexandra, wife of Tsar Nicholas II, civil unrest including the General Strike in England, the rise of socialism, and Irish and Indian nationalism. George V has been criticized for not rescuing the Russian Royal family but at the time there was serious concern that it would incite a similar revolution in the UK. He sent a ship in 1922 to rescue the Greek Royal family including 1 year old Prince Philip. In 1917 with anti-German sentiment running high, he changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (popularly known as Brunswick or Hanover) to Windsor, and he relinquished all German titles and family connections. George V enjoyed stamp collecting and although considered dull by biographers he became by his Silver Jubilee in 1935 a much loved King. In 1932 he started the tradition of the Royal Christmas broadcast which has continued ever since. His relationship deteriorated with his eldest son Edward (later Edward VIII) when he failed to settle down and had affairs with married women, but he was fond of his second son Albert (“Bertie” later George VI) and his granddaughter Elizabeth (later Elizabeth II) whom he called ‘Lilibet’. She called him ‘Grandpa England’. He died of pleurisy in January 1936.","completion":"1. How many children did King George and Queen Mary have? Answer: Six children. 2.

Mom, Dad, and their two young children all excitedly climbed in the car to head on their way. Dad explained that this was a different type of restaurant called a dim sum restaurant. Instead of ordering from a waitress and having one big plate of food prepared back in the kitchen, at dim sum, you order a variety of bite-sized Chinese dishes. You can pick from things like steamed dumplings, buns filled with sweet or savory things, rice rolls, and small plates of stir-fried vegetables or meats. All the dishes come around on large carts or trays, and every table can take a look and choose what they want as they pass by. The kids thought it sounded fun, and the parents were excited to do it again. Soon they arrived at the restaurant. After checking in they were quickly ushered to a booth, and there was action all around them. Carts were wheeling everywhere!

They had yummy-looking egg tarts that tasted like warm vanilla pie. The parents encouraged the kids to be adventurous and try new dishes. The kids tried a plate of sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves and were pleasantly surprised by the fragrant, savory rice and the hidden treasure of meats and vegetables inside.

Eating on public transport is also prohibited. - Eat all of your food: It's considered disrespectful to leave food unfinished and pick different parts out of your meal, both to your host and the farmers who farmed the vegetables and animals that gave their lives for your meal. - Learn proper chopstick etiquette: Lay your Chopsticks either flat in your bowl or on a chopstick rest. Never leave them sticking straight up in your rice bowl or pass food from chopsticks to chopsticks since these are associated with funeral rituals. - Let your host fill your glass: It is seen as thinking your hosts are ungracious to fill your glass on your own when drinking alcohol. Hold your glass a little bit off your table and wait for your host to fill it. - Give up your seat on public transit: If you see someone who may need your train seat more such as a pregnant woman, someone with small children, or elderly or disabled people be sure to give them your seat. Be aware some pregnant women are slim and carry pink tags to signify their right to reserved seats. - Take your shoes off: When entering someone’s home take your shoes off, this is standard etiquette.

Loudspeaker: Help direct traffic and relay information to personnel on the ground with a powerful loudspeaker, accessible in the cockpit. 5. Command and Control module: Sometimes the most useful thing you can do from high up is to help coordinate efforts on the ground.

There was also a gaping hole in the roof, where tiles had blown off last winter in the gales. Cobwebs decked every window and hung like macabre Halloween decorations. Then, there was the garden. Just a tangle of overgrown shrubs and trees, where roots had broken up the path. The heads of grotesque-looking statues stuck out amidst the tangle of weeds. They looked supernatural in the dusk. Almost unearthly! Some said the garden housed an ancient graveyard. Former residents of the house were laid to rest in the place where they had lived and died. They were destined to roam forever as ghosts within the walls of the manor. The house stood as a relic from a past era. People said it was old, ancient even. Nobody could date it, but everyone knew it was a house with a terrible reputation. The exact nature and circumstances were shrouded in mystery. Numerous rumors of its dark former life were whispered in hushed tones. Some talked of a murder: an innocent young girl, strangled in her bed as she slept. Others dismissed it as a legend. It was a secret lost to the depths of time. Some people told of strange goings-on. There were unexplainable noises at night. Haunting screams echoed out at midnight, as eerie, bloodcurdling moans, and dark shadows complete with disfigured faces were seen in the windows. That was enough to give even the bravest soul nightmares. The tales became more ghastly, more terrifying, and more outlandish every time they were recounted. I tried desperately to push these images to the back of my mind, but I could not escape the impending doom and feeling that horrific evil lingered beneath the walls of this house. This place was truly hostile. I paused, momentarily overcome with fear and trepidation at my mission. Through it all, I had made my mind up. I would face my fear and go in."},{"prompt":"What is Mardi Gras in New Orleans?","completion":"Mardi Gras is a holiday and cultural practice that dates back thousands of years. Also known as Carnival, it is celebrated in many countries, mostly those with large Catholic populations. Mardi Gras season is a prelude to Lent, the 40 days of fasting and penance between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday. Traditionally, in the days before Lent, celebrators would binge on all the rich, fatty foods in their homes in anticipation of several weeks of different types of fasting. When French explorers landed near present-day New Orleans, Louisiana, in March of 1699, they held a small celebration and dubbed their landing spot Point du Mardi Gras. New Orleans marked the holiday in the following decades with street parties, masked balls, and lavish dinners. To this day, Mardi Gras is still a tradition in New Orleans."},{"prompt":"Write a short article about the health benefits of lemons.

In 2018, Rick Smith, founder and CEO of Axon, the Scottsdale, Arizona-based manufacturer of Taser weapons and body cameras, became concerned that advances in technology were creating new and challenging ethical issues. So, he set up an independent AI ethics board made up of ethicists, AI experts, public policy specialists, and representatives of law enforcement to provide recommendations to Axon’s management. In 2019, the board recommended against adding facial recognition technology to the company’s line of body cameras, and in 2020, it provided guidelines regarding the use of automated license plate recognition technology. Axon’s management followed both recommendations. In 2022, the board recommended against a management proposal to produce a drone-mounted Taser designed to address mass shootings. After initially accepting the board’s recommendation, the company changed its mind and, in June 2022, in the wake of the Uvalde school shootings, announced it was launching the taser drone program anyway. The board’s response was dramatic: Nine of the 13 members resigned, and they released a letter that outlined their concerns. In response, the company announced a freeze on the project. As societal expectations grow for the responsible use of digital technologies, firms that promote better practices will have a distinct advantage. According to a 2022 study, 58% of consumers, 60% of employees, and 64% of investors make key decisions based on their beliefs and values. Strengthening your organization’s digital responsibility can drive value creation, and brands regarded as more responsible will enjoy higher levels of stakeholder trust and loyalty. These businesses will sell more products and services, find it easier to recruit staff, and enjoy fruitful relationships with shareholders. However, many organizations struggle to balance the legitimate but competing stakeholder interests. Key tensions arise between business objectives and responsible digital practices. For example, data localization requirements often contradict with the efficiency ambitions of globally distributed value chains. Ethical and responsible checks and balances that need to be introduced during AI/algorithm development tend to slow down development speed, which can be a problem when time-to-market is of utmost importance. Better data and analytics may enhance service personalization, but at the cost of customer privacy. Risks related to transparency and discrimination issues may dissuade organizations from using algorithms that could help drive cost reductions.","completion":"The text talks about Axon's AI ethics board, which was established by the CEO to address ethical concerns arising from rapidly developing technology. The board gave suggestions regarding facial recognition and automatic license plate recognition technology, which were implemented by Axon's management. However, when the board refused to produce a drone-mounted Taser after a school shooting, Axon accepted their suggestion but later reversed their stance, causing nine out of thirteen members to resign. The article focuses on the challenge of balancing business objectives with responsible digital practices and emphasizes the role of being responsible digitally for creating stakeholder trust and loyalty."},{"prompt":"Write a Reddit post on the thread AITA since I will not cook my husband steak since I am a vegetarian.","completion":"Hi everyone, I need some advice on whether I am the a**hole in this situation.

There are many uses for them. Here is a list of ways to reuse your bags at least one more time before throwing them away: 1. Line your small trash cans. Smaller trash cans such as the ones in the bathroom can be lined with plastic grocery bags, which helps to keep the can clean and odor-free. 2. Use them as emergency trash bags for the car. Keep a handful of bags rolled up in the glove box so they're handy when you're out and need one. 3. Use them as wet bags. Take a few plastic grocery bags with you the next time you visit the pool or beach. They can be great for keeping wet clothes and towels separate. 4. Pack your shoes in them in suitcases. Instead of putting your shoes loosely in your suitcase, put them in a plastic grocery bag to keep the soles from dirtying your clean clothes. 5. Pick up dog poop. Keep a handful handy for dog walks, and use plastic grocery bags instead of buying poop bags. 6. Stuff some into your shoes and purses to help them to retain their shape. Ball up plastic grocery bags and stuff all the shoes and purses in your closet. 7. Use them for packing and moving. You can wrap a few bags around breakables before packing them into boxes to protect them from breakage. 8. Store paint brushes or rollers in them. When you're going to come back to your painting project, just put your wet brush or roller into a bag until later. 9. Line a paint tray. Using a plastic bag to line your paint tray will make cleanup super easy when you're done. 10. Line your cat's litter box. Having a plastic bag in the litter box makes cleaning out the box so much easier, eliminating the need to empty and wash it."},{"prompt":"Can you write a Christmas letter and list to Santa asking for gifts that a 5-year-old would like?","completion":"Dear Santa, My name is Charlie and I am 5 years old!

Many developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and they continue to suffer from anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems. - Environmental effects: The bombings also had a significant impact on the environment. The radiation released by the bombs contaminated the soil and water, and it is still present in the area today. This has led to increased rates of cancer and other health problems in the region. - Social effects: The bombings also had a profound impact on the social fabric of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Could you summarize one for me?","completion":"Yes, there are a handful. One of the most disturbing cases involves two men who disappeared after being last seen with the same officer: Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos both disappeared from Naples, Florida, after being stopped by the same sheriff's deputy: Steven Calkins. Calkins claimed that he gave both of them rides, but their families and friends believe that he killed them. Santos was a 23-year-old undocumented Mexican immigrant who was last seen on November 16, 2003. He was driving with coworkers to work when his vehicle struck another vehicle. It is unclear who was at fault. Calkins took Santos into his patrol car and claimed he had released Santos at a nearby Circle K after writing him a couple of citations. However, Santos was never seen again and no evidence exists to support Santos was ever at the Circle K. Williams was a 24-year-old black man who was last seen on December 12, 2003. He was illegally driving an unregistered white Cadillac when he was stopped by Calkins. Calkins claimed he gave Williams a ride to a nearby Circle K, but no evidence exists to support Cakins' story. Calkins had the Cadillac towed, then lied about the entire incident just a few days later to a dispatcher who called him on his day off. There is evidence Calkins lied to investigators from his own department and there are many inconsistencies in his stories. He was let go for this reason and was investigated by members of his department, the FDLE, and even the FBI. However, no charges were ever filed. He remains the only person of interest, according to his ex-sheriff. A civil suit was filed by Williams' mother, which was ultimately lost.

Use a Trough Planter A raised garden bed is a natural choice for a vegetable garden using containers. By using a trough planter, you have a raised or standing height that allows users to harvest and tends to their crops easily without needing to hunch over or kneel. As well as being a practical gardening solution, trough planters also offer a great visual benefit for adding height to your pot. 2. Adding Potted Crops will Bring Productivity to any Patio Vegetable garden container ideas will give you the chance to increase your productivity on your patio. You can make use of your unused space and add a variety of crops such as tomatoes, beans, and pumpkins. And the great thing is you don't have to spend a lot of money on landscaping or dig up half your backyard for a fancy vegetable patch. Use your patio and seating space to add more symmetrical vibrance to your outdoor space. 3. Grow Potatoes in a Bag Potatoes are one of the easiest and simplest vegetables to grow and they are best grown in containers. If they are grown in a border, potatoes will spread into all the available soil not just in a small section where they are planted. When potatoes are planted in the ground, it can be difficult to harvest all of the crops. Placing them in a bag or container, it makes it much easier to harvest everything so that nothing is wasted. 4. Be Sure to Choose the Right Container Along with complementing your garden when using plant containers, you must get the right containers that are compatible with the plants you are growing. your containers should be 4 inches wider and deeper than the root ball of the plant. Shallow containers that are around 12 to 16 inches deep are great for shallow-rooted herbs and other annual vegetables. You can replenish the soil for each season when you replant them. If you are interested in growing larger plants such as aubergines or tomatoes, you would do your best by using one plant per container. 5. Design Raised Garden Bed Containers to Suit Your Outdoor Space Raised garden beds can make great vegetable garden containers if you have a large enough space to work with. The benefit of this is that you can have these containers made to fit your landscaping, no matter how large or small they need to be. There are many great materials out there to use for raised beds. One expert suggests using Corten steel due to its durability and capacity to be bent or folded into an unusual shape. The deep rust shade of the material is also very attractive and will look great with other materials like buff-colored gravel."},{"prompt":"Help me draft a home organization routine that focuses on decluttering and tidying up different areas of the house.

Format your response in a numbered list.","completion":"Here are five tips to help you quit smoking cigarettes along with an explanation for why each suggestion will be effective. The response is formatted in a numbered list: 1. Set a quit date within the next two weeks. Creating a concrete goal date will keep you accountable and help you mentally prepare to quit. Setting the date within the next two weeks will give you adequate time to prepare yourself without reducing your motivation to go through with it. 2. Tell your family, friends, and co-workers that you plan to quit. Not only will this help keep you accountable and on track to quit, but you will need the support and encouragement of your friends and family in order to follow through. 3. Anticipate and plan for the challenges you'll face while quitting. Increase your chance of success by thinking of any likely challenges and creating a plan for how to manage them. By anticipating and planning for how you will deal with challenges such as nicotine withdrawal, you will be more likely to make it through those difficult moments without relapsing. 4. Remove cigarettes from your home, car, and work. By completely removing cigarettes from your living and working areas, you will be less likely to think about cigarettes and consider smoking one once you've quit. 5. Talk to your doctor about getting help to quit. There is no need to meet this challenge alone. Your doctor can help you come up with a plan to deal with withdrawal symptoms and may be able to recommend over-the-counter products such as nicotine patches, lozenges, and gum. Speaking to a medical professional will help you answer any questions you have and put you in a positive mindset for success.

Ultimately, I've realized what I value most about a smartwatch is utility. After all, if the battery life is so short that I can't rely on the device to tell me the time, what good is it? As such, I am strongly in favor of e-ink displays for smartwatches. These displays only draw power when they change what they are displaying on the screen. As such, they offer phenomenal battery life. For a smartwatch, which is still mostly used to check the time and notifications, e-ink displays would offer significant advantages not only in battery life but also readability in sunlight. I would prefer my ideal smartwatch to use Wear OS as I currently use an Android phone and I appreciate its wide app compatibility. I am aware that there have been issues with Wear OS and battery life, but I believe an e-ink display with mitigate these disadvantages. As a possible additional feature, I would like the smartwatch to also store a pair of true wireless earbuds. This would allow me to have private, high-quality personal audio at all times without having to carry or pair another device. This may come at the cost of battery life, but again, I believe the e-ink display would be a major mitigating factor. Altogether, these features would combine to make my ideal smartwatch. Lamentably, no such device seems to exist yet. How's that? I wrote a description of an ideal smartwatch from the perspective of a tech reviewer, in the tone that you requested. Would you like me to add anything else?"},{"prompt":"I'm job searching and want to revise my resume. I need tips and suggestions on how to write a resume that will get noticed by hiring managers.","completion":"Here are some useful tips that will help you improve your resume so it will be noticed by hiring managers. 1. Plan Ahead - When rewriting or updating your resume, you need to focus on the key sections, which are your experience, objections, special skills, and education. The more organized you are when preparing to write your resume, the more it will show in the outcome. Get started by writing an outline so that you will know what you are going to include and what you will leave out. 2. Use Action Words and Bullet Points - Action verbs are incisive and can showcase to the reader what your skills are. Use words such as managed, planned, presented, supervised, coordinated, increased, or engaged to show off your accomplishments. And be sure to use plenty of bullet points to help make your content easy to scan and read. Doing so will also make it easier for you to make clear and concise statements. 3. Always Be Specific - When writing about all you have accomplished, be sure to make your statements clear and specific. Something like \\"Grew department revenue by 30 percent each year\\" will have more power than a statement that simply says \\"increased department revenue for the company\\". Be sure to use specific numbers, percentages, or dollar amounts whenever possible. It will help you get your point across. 4. Focus on the Positive - Always make sure you accentuate the positive thing and leave out anything negative when writing your resume. Share any special or unique accomplishments you have made, as well as any unique skills, awards, or winning work. And while it is a good idea to place your contact details at the top of the resume, you shouldn't add any personal details beyond that. 5. Make Use of Key Words - Keywords are excellent tools to use when you want to get your resume noticed. Some companies will use scanners to seek out words that are relevant to the jobs they posted. Additionally, the keywords you use can show that you have the right amount of industry knowledge for the job you are applying for. For instance, a market research professional may mention having experience in the voice of customer work, developing actionable customer insights, or analyzing high-level data and research. By following these useful tips, you will be able to improve your resume and gain the attention of the hiring managers you want to impress."},{"prompt":"What are some of the top concerns for those in the food industry?","completion":"Some of the most pressing issues in the food industry for business owners include food safety, food wastage, rising supply chain costs, increased consumer demand for food traceability and food fraud."},{"prompt":"Can you explain what food fraud is?","completion":"When a manufacturer adds a lower-priced vegetable oil to an expensive olive oil but sells the product as 100 percent olive oil, they are cheating their customers.

The other kitten was a bit of a princess. She was fluffy and preferred to sit on a cozy windowsill and watch the world go by. Her fur was gray, and her name was Malarkey. She didn't like to get in trouble because she knew if she was bad, she would get sprayed with a squirt bottle. One sunny day, Sootsprite's and Malarkey's human roommate left to go somewhere.

The man took his car keys and held the door open for a woman. \\"You be good now,\\" he said, looking right at Sootsprite. \\"I'm counting on you to not make a mess.\\" Malarkey looked back and forth between the man and Sootsprite. \\"Oh no,\\" she thought. \\"This could be bad.\\" Sure enough, as soon as he heard the keys turn in the lock, the little black cat jumped up from the couch. He ran to the window, pushing Malarkey aside and watched as a white car pulled away from the curb. He turned to Malarkey with a big toothy grin on his face. She stared back and shook her head. But Sootsprite didn't heed her warning. He jumped down from the windowsill and ran into the kitchen. CRASH! Malarkey sighed and decided to go and see what he'd done. She stretched her back legs, then her front legs, and gracefully hopped to the couch, then the ground. By the time she got to the kitchen, there were treats all over the linoleum.

(See the latest figures here.) Scientists have made rapid progress in understanding the culprit, a new virus in the coronavirus family, which has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2. The pneumonia-like disease it causes is called COVID-19. As the virus has spread, however, misinformation has, too. We’ve written about many bogus claims about the new coronavirus spread through social media, as well as false and misleading claims made by politicians. See our Coronavirus Coverage page for a guide to our articles. Here, we answer some key questions about what is known so far about the outbreak and the virus. When did the outbreak begin, and what is the cause? Scientists are still working to determine when the virus first emerged in people, but the earliest known instances of the disease occurred in early December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. After a string of mysterious pneumonia cases, many of them linked to a seafood market selling wild game and live animals, officials reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31. By Jan. 7, Chinese authorities had isolated a virus, later named SARS-CoV-2, as the cause of the disease, and shared the genome a few days later. This allowed other countries to test for the virus, and for scientists to begin devising treatments and investigating how the outbreak began. Coronaviruses are a diverse family of large RNA viruses that have characteristic spikes on their surface, making them look like they have a halo, or corona, when viewed under a microscope. Most coronaviruses that infect humans are relatively benign and cause mild respiratory diseases such as the common cold, said Susan Weiss, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, in a phone interview. But in recent years, new coronaviruses have cropped up that are far more dangerous to humans, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus, which led to a global outbreak in 2003, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, virus, which was identified in 2012. According to the WHO, SARS ultimately infected more than 8,000 people, killing 774. Since 2012, there have been nearly 2,500 MERS cases and 858 deaths. The new virus is fairly similar to the SARS virus — and is in the same betacoronavirus subgroup as both the SARS and MERS viruses — but is considered a new pathogen. What are the symptoms, and how severe is the disease? The virus causes a pneumonia-like respiratory illness that varies in severity, but can be deadly. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. A report in the Lancet that analyzed the first 41 people admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 infection suggests that clinically, the illness is similar to SARS, although fewer patients appear to have diarrhea or upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, a runny nose and sore throat. Some people also report fatigue, and in some cases people have been found to be infected, but clear of any symptoms. Many of the symptoms are common to other respiratory diseases. Lab tests based on the virus’ genetic sequence can confirm infection. It’s not yet known how frequently people die from COVID-19. The reported fatality rates have fluctuated as the disease has spread, hovering around 2-3% in late January, and around 4% as of March 18. For comparison, SARS killed around 10% of infected people, if not more, while seasonal influenza typically kills 0.1% or less, David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, said in an email. But these estimates, which are simple calculations of the number of deaths relative to the number of known cases, may not accurately reflect how dangerous the virus is, since the disease course is still underway for many patients, Fisman said. It’s also likely that far more people have been infected, but have not gone to hospitals or had their illnesses confirmed. For example, if two-thirds of cases are unreported, he said, the case fatality rate may be significantly lower. (For more on the fatality rate, see our March 5 story “Trump and the Coronavirus Death Rate.”) According to a February study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 14% of cases in mainland China were severe and 5% were critical. Reports indicate that while healthy people can fall seriously ill and die, deaths are primarily in older folks and those with preexisting conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory conditions and hypertension. The Chinese CDC study, for instance, found a mortality rate of 14.8% in patients 80 and older and 8% for those 70 to 79, while the overall fatality rate then was 2.3% for cases in mainland China. Similar statistics from Italy bear out this trend. As of March 15, no one in the country below the age of 30 had died from COVID-19, but a fifth or more of those above age 80 with the disease had. In Italy, about 25% of cases have been severe. How is the virus transmitted, and how contagious is it? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the new coronavirus is transmitted from person to person in close contact, within about 6 feet of one another. Scientists suspect the transmission is similar to how influenza is spread, with the virus travelling through respiratory droplets when infected people cough or sneeze. This is how scientists believe past coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS have spread. The incubation period, or how long before someone who is infected shows symptoms, is estimated to be around 4 days, but may range from 2 to 14 days, according to the CDC. There is some evidence that asymptomatic people can transmit the virus to others. A March 16 Science study that modeled how the outbreak unfolded in China also found that people who have few or no symptoms may be responsible for the bulk of the disease spread. The CDC, however, says that people are “thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic” and that asymptomatic people are “not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.” It also could be possible to contract the disease by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your mouth, nose or even eyes. A study released in mid-March by scientists with the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA and Princeton found the virus could be detected for up to 24 hours on cardboard and much longer on hard surfaces including plastic and stainless steel — for up to two to three days. At a March 18 press conference, coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said that “we’re still working out how much is it by human-human transmission and how much is it by surface,” adding that the fundamental guidelines are to avoid exposure to “excess number of persons who could be asymptomatic and infected … and don’t expose yourself to surfaces that could have had the virus on it.” It’s also unclear exactly how infectious the new virus is. Several groups of scientists have attempted to estimate SARS-CoV-2’s basic reproduction number, or R0, which is the average number of other people one person infects, assuming everyone in the population is susceptible. Using a variety of methods, multiple teams have arrived at figures that generally range from 1.5 to 4, which suggest the transmissibility is roughly in line with that of SARS, but below that of the measles virus, which has an R0 of around 12 to 18, and is one of the most infectious viruses in the world. “Despite the diversity of approaches taken there’s remarkable consistency in estimates from highly competent investigators, which seem to fall between 2 and 3,” said Fisman. An early estimate from the WHO, for example, suggested that every infected person would spread the virus to 1.4 to 2.5 people, on average, while a team at Imperial College London pegged the R0 at 2.6. A group at the University of Bern in Switzerland calculated an R0 of 1.4 to 3.8, and Harvard researchers Maia Majumder and Kenneth Mandl estimated a figure between 2 and 3.1. While the figures provide some clue as to how contagious the virus is, it’s important to recognize that these values don’t necessarily say anything about how widespread the outbreak will be. As Majumder pointed out on Twitter, the R0 reflects potential transmission, not actual transmission — and that even though seasonal flu has a relatively low R0 of about 1.3, it causes millions of cases per year, whereas SARS had an R0 between 2 and 5, and led to fewer than 10,000 cases. “Planning, preparedness, and infection control can effectively bring an outbreak of a novel, moderate-R_0 disease to a close even in the absence of vaccines,” Majumder said in a tweet. “Because of this, estimates of R_0 for #nCoV2019 should be viewed as a call to action instead of a reason to panic.” How can people protect themselves from contracting or spreading the virus? The CDC advises people to wash their hands frequently, with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds, avoid touching their faces with unwashed hands, avoid close contact with sick individuals, and avoid social interactions generally to prevent community spread. The CDC website provides advice on what to do if you’re sick and other resources.","completion":"This text is objective.

Why are some cars called “sedans?” Is that word used anywhere else? Do you know where it came from?","completion":"The term sedan has been used to describe certain cars since 1912, but it does have a deeper past. Historically, “sedans” were transportation methods used by wealthy people throughout the world at least as far back as the 1600s. A sedan was a specific type of litter with a single enclosed chair with windows. It was carried by two porters – one in front and one behind the enclosed litter. The first recorded use of the term to describe a motor vehicle was in 1912 by the Studebaker company. The specific definition has evolved over time. Today’s sedans are defined as fixed-roof passenger cars that contain three separate compartments: one for the engine, one for passengers, and one for cargo. Though many vehicles blur the lines between sedans and other styles, in common parlance, this definition still holds. Incidentally, some countries use different terms for this style of passenger car.

He then pursued a doctorate in English at Brown University. He never completed his dissertation but wrote parts of Edwin Mullhouse in two separate stays at Brown. Between times at the university, he wrote Portrait of a Romantic at his parents' house in Connecticut. His story \\"The Invention of Robert Herendeen\\" (in The Barnum Museum) features a failed student who has moved back in with his parents; the story is loosely based on this period of Millhauser's life.[1] Until the Pulitzer Prize, Millhauser was best known for his 1972 debut novel, Edwin Mullhouse. This novel, about a precocious writer whose career ends abruptly with his death at age eleven, features the fictional Jeffrey Cartwright playing Boswell to Edwin's Johnson. Edwin Mullhouse brought critical acclaim, and Millhauser followed with a second novel, Portrait of a Romantic, in 1977, and his first collection of short stories, In The Penny Arcade, in 1986. Possibly the most well-known of his short stories is \\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\\" (published in \\"The Barnum Museum\\"), based on a pseudo-mythical tale of a magician who stunned audiences in Vienna in the latter part of the 19th century. It was made into the film The Illusionist (2006).[2] Millhauser's stories often treat fantasy themes in a manner reminiscent of Poe or Borges, with a distinctively American voice. As critic Russell Potter has noted, \\"In (Millhauser's stories), mechanical cowboys at penny arcades come to life; curious amusement parks, museums, or catacombs beckon with secret passageways and walking automata; dreamers dream and children fly out their windows at night on magic carpets.\\"[3] Millhauser's collections of stories continued with The Barnum Museum (1990), Little Kingdoms (1993), and The Knife Thrower and Other Stories (1998).

The bear stopped to listen to her song. “You have such a pretty voice,” said the bear. “Thank you so much!” the bird replied. “I’ve been singing since I was born, I guess. It relaxes me.” “Could you teach me to sing?” “Oh my! Well, you have a deep, raspy voice. You don’t seem to have a good singing voice.” The bear made a face. “But you could teach me.” “Hmm, let me think about it.” The bird sat there, making odd faces for a few moments. Finally, she spoke. “I’m sure you have many talents, but your voice is too deep and raspy. You’ll never be a good singer, but there are lots of other things you could do besides singing.” The bear was very disappointed. “I don’t seem to have any skills or talents.” “You’re a good hunter. You’re good at scaring off the wolves and foxes. Just think about all the positive ways you could be helpful. You’re big and strong and you can carry heavy things.” “Hmm, I suppose you’re right. I do have some skills that other animals don’t have.” “Oh yes indeed. I could never carry a large bee’s nest, but you can. I could never scare away a predator. Be thankful for all the ways that you are unique instead of wishing to be somebody else.” The bear listened and learned so much that day. He began to realize what a unique individual he was. And he started appreciating his skills and talents. He and the yellow warbler became good friends after that. The bird would fly over to his cave where she would sing for him, then they would eat dinner together."},{"prompt":"In what ways has Lupita Nyong'o advocated for more diversity and socially-conscious storytelling in film and media?

It's common for a sighted person to wonder what blind people see or for a blind person to wonder whether the experience is the same for others without sight. There is no single answer to the question, \\"What do blind people see?\\" because there are different degrees of blindness. Also, since it's the brain that \\"sees\\" information, it matters whether a person ever had sight. What Blind People Actually See Blind From Birth: A person who has never had sight doesn't see. Samuel, who was born blind, tells ThoughtCo that saying that a blind person sees black is incorrect because that person often has no other sensation of sight to compare against. \\"It's just nothingness,\\" he says. For a sighted person, it can be helpful to think of it like this: Close one eye and use the open eye to focus on something. What does the closed eye see? Nothing. Another analogy is to compare a blind person's sight to what you see with your elbow. Went Totally Blind: People who have lost their sight have different experiences. Some describe seeing complete darkness, like being in a cave. Some people see sparks or experience vivid visual hallucinations that may take the form of recognizable shapes, random shapes, and colors, or flashes of light. The \\"visions\\" are a hallmark of Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS). CBS may be lasting or transient in nature. It is not a mental illness and is not associated with brain damage. In addition to total blindness, there is functional blindness. Definitions of functional blindness vary from one country to the next. In the United States, it refers to visual impairment where vision in the better eye with the best correction with glasses is worse than 20/200.1 The World Health Organization defines blindness as presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60.2 What functionally blind people see depends on the severity of blindness and the form of impairment. Legally Blind: A person may be able to see large objects and people, but they are out of focus. A legally blind person may see colors or see in focus at a certain distance (e.g., be able to count fingers in front of the face). In other cases, color acuity may be lost or all vision is hazy. The experience is highly variable. Joey, who has 20/400 vision, tells ThoughtCo that he \\"constantly sees neon speckles that are always moving and changing colors.\\" Light Perception: A person who still has light perception can't form clear images, but can tell when the lights are on or off. Tunnel Vision: Vision may be relatively normal (or not), but only within a certain radius. A person with tunnel vision can't see objects except within a cone of less than 10 degrees.","completion":"[Introduction] [Opening shot: A black screen with the title \\"What Do Blind People See?\\" appears, with dramatic music] Narrator: It's a question that has puzzled both sighted individuals and those without sight for centuries. What do blind people actually see? The answer, however, is not a simple one. Join us on this journey as we explore the various degrees of blindness and dive into the fascinating world of visual perception. [Scene 1: Blind from Birth] [Cut to the interview with Samuel, a blind individual, sitting in a comfortable room] Samuel: When people ask me what I see, it's hard to explain because I've never had sight. It's not like seeing darkness or blackness; it's simply nothingness. There is no frame of reference, it's like trying to see with your elbow. [Narrator's voice-over] Narrator: For those born blind, the concept of sight is entirely foreign. Samuel compares it to closing one eye while the other focuses on something. What does the closed eye see? Nothing. It's void, a world of emptiness. [Scene 2: Went Totally Blind] [Cut to the series of interviews with individuals who have lost their sight.] Narrator: But what about those who once had their sight and lost it? Their experiences can vary greatly. Some describe it as being surrounded by complete darkness, akin to being trapped in a pitch-black cave. Others may see sparks or experience vivid visual hallucinations. [Cut to a close-up of visuals resembling those experienced by individuals with Charles Bonnet Syndrome] Narrator: These \\"visions' are known as Charles Bonnet syndrome, which can manifest as recognizable shapes, random patterns, or flashes of light. It's important to note that CBS is not a mental illness and is not associated with brain damage. [Scene 3: Functional Blindness] [Cut to a visually impaired person using a cane to navigate the streets.] Narrator: In addition to total blindness, there is a condition known as functional blindness. The severity of this impairment can vary, and it is often defined differently from one country to another. [Cut to a close-up of a visually impaired person's eye] Narrator: In the United States, functional blindness refers to a visual impairment where the best-corrected vision in the better eye is worse than 20/200. However, according to the World Health Organization, blindness is defined as presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60. [Cut to a visually impaired person describing their experience.] Narrator: For those who are functionally blind, what they see depends on the severity of their impairment and the specific form of visual limitation they experience. [Scene 4: Legally Blind] [Cut to an interview with Joey, a legally blind person, sitting in a living room.] Joey: My vision is hazy, and things are often out of focus. I can see colors, but they're not as vibrant or clear as for someone with normal vision. It's like constantly seeing neon speckles that are always moving and changing colors. [Narrator's voiceover] Narrator: Joey, who is considered legally blind with 20/400 vision, explains the challenges he faces. While he can perceive large objects and people, his visual acuity is greatly diminished. [Scene 5: Light Perception and Tunnel Vision] [Cut to a visually impaired person observing a light turning on and off] Narrator: For some individuals, even though they can't form clear images, they still have light perception. They can discern when lights are on or off, distinguishing between brightness and darkness. [Cut to a person with tunnel vision navigating a crowded street] Narrator: Others may have a condition called tunnel vision. Within a limited radius, their vision may be relatively normal. However, they cannot see objects beyond a small cone of less than 10 degrees. [Conclusion] [Narrator's voiceover] Narrator: So, what do blind people see? The answer is complex and multifaceted. From the emptiness experienced by those born blind to the varying perceptions of individuals who have lost their sight, it's clear that there is no single answer. The world of visual perception is as diverse as the people who inhabit it.

It is the most powerful rocket in use today, but it hasn’t launched since June 2019.

This launch carried two satellites from the US Space Force, which has released scant details on what they will be used for – one of the two is classified. Both are now heading towards orbits about 36,000 kilometres above the ground in what is called a geostationary orbit, meaning the satellites will remain over the same spot on the planet and appear motionless in the sky.","completion":"The sentiment in this article is generally positive.

The conditions needed to produce lightning have been known for some time. However, exactly how lightning forms has never been verified, so there is room for debate. Leading theories focus around separation of electric charge and generation of an electric field within a thunderstorm. Recent studies also indicate that ice, hail, and semi-frozen water drops are essential to lightning development. Storms that fail to produce large quantities of ice usually fail to produce lightning. Forecasting when and where lightning will strike is not yet possible and most likely never will be. But by educating yourself about lightning and learning some basic safety rules, you, your family, and your friends can avoid needless exposure to the dangers of one of the most capricious and unpredictable forces of nature. Thunderstorms have very turbulent environments. Strong updrafts and downdrafts occur with regularity and within close proximity to each other. The updrafts transport small liquid water droplets from the lower regions of the storm to heights between 35,000 and 70,000 feet, which is miles above the freezing level. Meanwhile, downdrafts transport hail and ice from the frozen upper regions of the storm. When these collide, the water droplets freeze and release heat. This heat in turn keeps the surface of the hail and ice slightly warmer than their surrounding environment, and a \\"soft hail\\", or \\"graupel\\", forms. When graupel collides with additional water droplets and ice particles, a critical phenomenon occurs: electrons are sheared off of the ascending particles and collect on the descending particles. Because electrons carry a negative charge, the result is a storm cloud with a negatively charged base and a positively charged top. In the world of electricity, opposites attract and insulators inhibit. As positive and negative charges begin to separate within the cloud, an electric field is generated between its top and base. Further separation of these charges into pools of positive and negative regions results in a strengthening of the electric field. However, the atmosphere is a very good insulator that inhibits electric flow, so a TREMENDOUS amount of charge has to build up before lightning can occur. When that charge threshold is reached, the strength of the electric field overpowers the atmosphere's insulating properties, and lightning results. The electric field within the storm is not the only one that develops. Below the negatively charged storm base, positive charge begins to pool within the surface of the Earth (see image right). This positive charge will shadow the storm wherever it goes and is responsible for cloud-to-ground lightning. However, the electric field within the storm is much stronger than the one between the storm base and the Earth's surface, so most lightning (~75-80%) occurs within the storm cloud itself. How Lightning Develops Between The Cloud And The Ground It is invisible to the human eye and shoots to the ground in a series of rapid steps, each occurring in less time than it takes to blink. As the negative leader approaches the ground, positive charge collects in the ground and in objects on the ground. When these channels connect, the resulting electrical transfer is what we see as lightning. After the initial lightning stroke, if enough charge is leftover, additional lightning strokes will use the same channel, giving the bolt its flickering appearance. Take it to the MAX! The Lightning Process: Keeping in Step Tall objects, such as trees and skyscrapers, are commonly struck by lightning. Mountains also make good targets. This is because their tops are closer to the base of the storm cloud. Remember, the atmosphere is a good electrical insulator. The less distance the lightning has to burn through, the easier it is for it to strike. However, this does not always mean tall objects will be struck. Lightning can strike the ground in an open field even if the tree line is nearby - it all depends on where the charges accumulate.","completion":"Lightning is a fascinating natural phenomenon. The way it is created depends heavily on the types of clouds that are formed. It has been shown that large amounts of ice, whether that be hail or semi-frozen water, are required for lightning to form. When a thunderstorm cloud is formed, the top of it is positively charged and the bottom of it is negatively charged. There is something in the clouds called a \\"charge threshold\\" which is essentially the amount of charge the clouds together have to reach before lightning is formed. Below the negatively charged bottom part of the cloud, positively charged ions form on the Earth's surface. Since opposite charges are attracted to each other, the negatively charged cloud will send a charge out to the positively charged part of Earth's surface after the threshold is reached. This charge that reaches the Earth from the cloud is lightning. Most of the time lightning strikes, it will strike something tall like a skyscraper or tall tree. The reason for this is that the positively charged ions will travel up this tall object making the distance between the ions and the negatively charged cloud smaller. The smaller the distance, the stronger the attraction will be. This however does not mean that lightning will always strike what is closer to it, if a flat surface has more positive ions than the taller surface, lightning will most likely strike the flat surface since the attraction would still be stronger than the one with less distance. To summarize, Lightning strikes depend on the amount of ice in clouds, the charge threshold of the clouds, and the strength of attraction between the negatively charged bottom part of the cloud and the positively charged parts of Earth's surface."},{"prompt":"Please write a creative drama/mystery short story scene about Olivia who meets Jacob in a room with guards and tells him he will be released soon because they found the real killer.

Here are some tips: 1. Choose Native Plants - selecting plants that are native to your region is vital. Plants that are from the area naturally are used to the conditions and require less care, such as fertilizers, watering, and pesticides. 2. Modify Your Lawn Care - Try replacing your grass with other landscaping items, native low-growing grasses, flowers, vegetable gardens, and hardscape elements. You could even try synthetic grass. 3. Avoid Chemical Herbicides and Pesticides - Herbicides, and pesticides are terrible for the environment. Old fashion hand weeding and native plants are often all it takes to get rid of unwanted pests. There are many DIY earth-conscious ways to get the pest out. 4. Use Soil Products Made From Recycled Organic Material - All that organic waste that you were going to throw out can be composted. By composting your organic materials, you are saving space at landfills and producing great soil for your garden. 5. Be Rain Ready - Make sure you prepare for the rain, meaning avoid concrete driveways and walkways and choose absorbent materials so there is no runoff into sewers. Try adding rain barrels around your home to collect rainwater."},{"prompt":"I need to write an email to the guy who cuts our lawn, Dave.

If the physical cause of Marvin Gaye’s death was straightforward—”Gunshot wound to chest perforating heart, lung and liver,” according to the Los Angeles County Coroner—the events that led to it were much more tangled. On the one hand, there was the longstanding conflict with his father dating back to childhood. Marvin Gay, Sr., (the “e” was added by his son for his stage name) was a preacher in the Hebrew Pentecostal Church and a proponent of a strict moral code he enforced brutally with his four children. He was also, by all accounts, a hard-drinking cross-dresser who personally embodied a rather complicated model of morality. By some reports, Marvin Sr. harbored significant envy over his son’s tremendous success, and Marvin Jr. clearly harbored unresolved feelings toward his abusive father. Those feelings spilled out for the final time in the Los Angeles home of Marvin Gay, Sr., and his wife Alberta. Their son, the international recording star, had moved into his parents’ home in late 1983 at a low point in his struggle with depression, debt and cocaine abuse. Only one year removed from his first Grammy win and from a triumphant return to the pop charts with “Sexual Healing,” Marvin Gaye was in horrible physical, psychological and financial shape. After an argument between father and son escalated into a physical fight on the morning of April 1, 1984, Alberta Gay was trying to calm her son in his bedroom when Marvin Sr. took a revolver given to him by Marvin Jr. and shot him three times in his chest. Marvin Gaye’s brother, Frankie, who lived next door, and who held the legendary singer during his final minutes, later wrote in his memoir that Marvin Gaye’s final, disturbing statement was, “I got what I wanted….I couldn’t do it myself, so I made him do it.”","completion":"• What was the physical cause of Marvin Gaye's death?

An asteroid that may host life's building blocks will get a visit from a United Arab Emirates (UAE) spacecraft about a decade from now, if all goes according to plan. In October 2021, the UAE announced that it plans to launch an ambitious mission to the asteroid belt in 2028. That mission will visit seven different space rocks, and even land on one of them, an asteroid called (269) Justitia. On Sunday (May 28), the nation gave us some new information about this bold asteroid mission — including its name, the Emirates Mission to the Asteroid Belt (EMA). \\"We will never cease to look ahead; we will never cease our efforts to develop a brighter future for our young generations,\\" Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoumbin Rashid Al Maktoum, the vice president and prime minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai, said in a statement. The EMA spacecraft will be named after the sheikh, we learned Sunday: It will be called the MBR Explorer. The MBR Explorer will visit its first asteroid in 2030, and will follow an orbital path allowing it to pick up speed from several planets along the way. (It's common for spacecraft to get such \\"gravity assists\\" from worlds like Venus or Mars to save on fuel, and to do side observations to test their instruments.) After passing by six asteroids, the mission aims to touch down upon Justitia in 2034 with a small lander that will deploy from MBR Explorer. Justitia may have organic molecules on its surface; organics are the building blocks of the complex molecules that could form life in the right circumstances. More generally, scientists seek water and organics all over the solar system to better understand how life arose on Earth. That search may be especially meaningful on Justitia, which may have formed closer to our planet and then migrated out to its current position in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, scientists say. The rest of the mission manifest includes flybys of the asteroids (10254) Westerwald, (623) Chimaera, (13294) Rockox; (88055) 2000 VA28, (23871) 1998 RC76 and (59980) 1999 SG6, all meant to represent \\"different classes of asteroid with varied compositional types,\\" UAE Space Agency officials said in the same statement. Justitia and Chimaera are around 31 miles (50 kilometers) in diameter, with the remaining asteroids less than 6 miles (10 km) across each. Four science instruments have been announced to probe the geology, composition and structure of the asteroids: a high-resolution camera, a thermal infrared camera, a mid-wavelength spectrometer and an infrared spectrometer. The UAE Space Agency was formed in 2014 and is one of the youngest space agencies in the world; by comparison, NASA was formed in 1958 from previous U.S. government groups. The UAE's Hope Mars orbiter, which launched in 2020, was the first Arab spacecraft to reach the Red Planet, making it on the first try, no less. The first UAE astronaut, Hazzaa al Mansoori, launched on a short mission to the International Space Station in 2019. There is another UAE astronaut in orbit right now: Sultan Al Neyadi, who launched to the orbiting lab in March on SpaceX's Crew-6 mission.","completion":"In the annals of time, an audacious mission stands ready to challenge the unknown. A decade from now, a daring spacecraft from the United Arab Emirates will sail through the cosmos, seeking the cradle of life on a far-flung asteroid. This tale began in October 2021, when the UAE unfurled its grand vision to venture into the asteroid belt by 2028. The mission, a thrilling odyssey through seven alien rocks, harbors an even grander objective: landing on a particular asteroid, christened (269) Justitia. Fast forward to a Sunday, May 28, a day of revelation. The UAE bestowed a name upon this bold endeavor, baptizing it the Emirates Mission to the Asteroid Belt (EMA). \\"We will perpetually strive towards the horizon, nurturing a promising future for our youth,\\" avowed Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoumbin Rashid Al Maktoum, the visionary behind the UAE's ambition, its vice president, prime minister, and the ruler of Dubai. As an ode to this great leader, the spacecraft embarking on this voyage was named MBR Explorer. Setting sail in 2030, the MBR Explorer would chart a course through the planets, harnessing their gravitational pulls to slingshot itself, not unlike a cosmic game of pinball. This celestial dance, a common strategy to conserve fuel, also serves as an opportunity for the spacecraft to flex its scientific muscles, testing its tools on these celestial bodies. The culmination of this adventure would arrive in 2034 when MBR Explorer makes its historic touchdown on Justitia. This ancient rock could harbor the blueprint of life itself, organic molecules. These are the seeds from which, under favorable conditions, life could spring. The scientific community continually seeks the presence of water and organics throughout our solar system, probing into the origins of life on our own planet. Their pursuit might find meaning on Justitia, a rock thought to have migrated from closer to Earth into the asteroid belt that girdles Mars and Jupiter. Beyond Justitia, the voyage would undertake flybys of several asteroids, each representing diverse asteroid classes, embodying varied compositions. Among them, Justitia and Chimaera loom the largest, with a diameter stretching to around 31 miles, while the remaining are lesser in size, barely crossing 6 miles. Armed with four science instruments, the MBR Explorer is poised to unravel the mysteries of these asteroids, studying their geology, composition, and structure. From high-resolution and thermal infrared cameras to spectrometers of different wavelengths, it’s well equipped for its task. A mere decade since its inception in 2014, the UAE Space Agency stands as one of the youngest players in the celestial arena. Yet, it has already made its mark, launching the Hope Mars orbiter, the first Arab spacecraft to reach the Red Planet, and successfully so on its first attempt. It also has the honor of launching the first UAE astronaut, Hazzaa al Mansoori, to the International Space Station in 2019. Now, another UAE astronaut, Sultan Al Neyadi, orbits our planet, having embarked on SpaceX's Crew-6 mission in March."},{"prompt":"Give me some examples of a short message to go with the flowers I'm giving my mom for Mother's Day.
