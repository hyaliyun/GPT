The February Revolution had toppled Tsar Nicolas II of Russia, and replaced his government with the Russian Provisional Government. However, the provisional government was weak and riven by internal dissension. It continued to wage World War I, which became increasingly unpopular. A nationwide crisis developed in Russia, affecting social, economic, and political relations. Disorder in industry and transport had intensified, and difficulties in obtaining provisions had increased. Gross industrial production in 1917 had decreased by over 36% from what it had been in 1914. In the autumn, as much as 50% of all enterprises were closed down in the Urals, the Donbas, and other industrial centers, leading to mass unemployment. At the same time, the cost of living increased sharply. Real wages fell about 50% from what they had been in 1913. Russia's national debt in October 1917 had risen to 50 billion rubles. Of this, debts to foreign governments constituted more than 11 billion rubles. The country faced the threat of financial bankruptcy. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many billion rubles of debt were not owed to foreign governments?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, Russia's national debt in October 1917 was 50 billion rubles, with debts to foreign governments constituting more than 11 billion rubles.

Write an article based on this \\"The French government has proposed a €600m (£420m; 655m) package of urgent aid for farmers, who have blocked roads for days in protest at falling prices.\\"","completion":"Title: The French Government Proposes a €600m Aid Package for Struggling Farmers Introduction In recent days, French farmers have taken to the streets, blocking roads and causing significant disruptions, to protest falling prices of their produce. In response, the French government has proposed a substantial €600 million (655m; £420m) aid package to alleviate their financial struggles and address their concerns. This article will explore the factors contributing to the declining prices, the reasons behind the farmers' protests, and the details of the government's proposed solution. The Plight of French Farmers Over the past few years, French farmers have faced a series of challenges that have resulted in a sharp decline in the price of their agricultural commodities. The combination of a struggling global economy, volatile commodity markets, and an increasingly competitive European agricultural sector has caused their products' prices to drop. Dairy farmers, in particular, have borne the brunt of these falling prices. Following the removal of European Union milk quotas in 2015, which had limited milk production for decades, there has been an increase in production and a corresponding decrease in prices. Consequently, many small-scale farmers have struggled to maintain a sustainable income level. Other sectors of the French agricultural industry, such as livestock and grain farming, are also feeling the impact of low prices. The prolonged 2014-2015 Russian import ban on EU agricultural products has significant consequences for those who had relied on Russia as a primary export market. Additionally, increased competition from non-EU countries, such as the United States and Brazil, has further strained the farmers' financial situation. The Farmers' Protest Frustrated with their challenging financial situation, French farmers decided to make their issues public by organizing large-scale protests. Over several days, they blocked major highways, resulting in significant disruptions to transportation. They also engaged in highly visible demonstrations, driving their tractors into cities like Paris and Lyon, in a bid to capture national and international attention. The protestors demanded that the government take decisive action to address their financial woes and stabilize the agricultural industry. They argued that policies prioritizing free trade and industrial agriculture in France and the EU have created a hostile environment for small-scale farmers. Thus, the government and EU institutions needed to reassess and change these policies to preserve both the livelihood and the cultural identity of the French countryside. The €600m Aid Package In response to the farmers' protests, the French government has proposed a significant aid package, totaling €600 million (655m; £420m). This financial aid is aimed at alleviating the immediate financial difficulties faced by the farmers, with concrete measures targeting different elements of their hardship: 1. Loan deferral or re-profiling: The aid package allows farmers to defer payments on existing loans or restructure their loans to reduce immediate financial pressure. A large portion of the €600m will be devoted to this measure. 2. Tax rebates and exemptions: The government has also decided to implement tax rebates and exemptions for struggling farmers, as another means of easing their financial burden. 3. Investment support: A portion of the proposed aid package will be earmarked for investment in the modernization and innovation of the French agricultural sector. By supporting farmers in upgrading their methods and technology, the government aims to create more competitive, resilient, and profitable farming operations. 4. EU-level influence: Finally, the French government declared its commitment to seeking reform on the EU level. The farmers' struggles are not only a national issue: they exemplify the challenges faced by many small-scale European farmers. The French government, therefore, promised to push for change within EU agricultural policies that would benefit farmers across Europe. Conclusion The French government's €600 million aid package for farmers demonstrates a commitment to addressing the pressing concerns of its vital agricultural sector. It remains to be seen whether this significant financial support, coupled with a unified effort to reform EU agricultural policies, will provide long-lasting relief for French farmers. Ultimately, their ability to adapt to the changing landscape will be crucial for preserving the agricultural industry and cultural heritage of rural France."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since 2010 it has become the most common aspect ratio for televisions and computer monitors, and is also the international standard format of HDTV, Full HD, non-HD digital television and analog widescreen television. This has replaced the old . Dr. Kerns H. Powers, a member of the SMPTE Working Group on High-Definition Electronic Production, first proposed the 16:9 (1.7:1) aspect ratio at a time when nobody was creating 16:9 videos. The popular choices in 1980 were: 1.3:1 (based on television standard's ratio at the time), 1.6:1 (the European \\"flat\\" ratio), 1.85:1 (the American \\"flat\\" ratio), 2.20:1 (the ratio of 70 mm films and Panavision) and 2.39:1 (the CinemaScope ratio for anamorphic widescreen films). Powers cut out rectangles with equal areas, shaped to match each of the popular aspect ratios. When overlapped with their center points aligned, he found that all of those aspect ratio rectangles fit within an outer rectangle with an aspect ratio of 1.7:1 and all of them also covered a smaller common inner rectangle with the same aspect ratio 1.7:1. The value found by Powers is exactly the geometric mean of the extreme aspect ratios, 4:3 (1.3:1) and 2.35:1 (or 64:27, see also for more information), √ ≈ 1.770 which is coincidentally close to 16:9 (1.7:1).

(CNN) -- Ayman al-Zawahiri, the longtime deputy to Osama bin Laden, will take over leadership of al Qaeda, according to a statement posted on several jihadist websites Thursday. The United States believes that al-Zawahiri has indeed taken the helm of the terrorist network, according to a U.S. counterterrorism official. Al-Zawahiri was widely regarded as al Qaeda's de facto leader since U.S. special forces killed Osama bin Laden at a hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2. \\"Hereby the General Command of the Qaeda al-Jihad -- and after the end of the consultations -- we declare that Sheikh Dr. Abu Muhammad Ayman al-Zawahiri (may God bless him) will take over the responsibility of command of the group,\\" the statement said, attributed to al Qaeda's \\"general command.\\" The","completion":"appointment of Ayman al-Zawahiri as the new al Qaeda leader highlights the group's ongoing commitment to its extremist ideology and jihadist activities, raising concerns among global security and intelligence agencies about the potential for increased terrorist threats and attacks in various parts of the world. As al-Zawahiri assumes command, analysts predict a possible shift in the group's tactics and strategies, as he brings his unique background, skills, and experience to the role. While bin Laden was known for his charisma and ability to rally followers around a common cause, al-Zawahiri's strengths lie in his organizational and operational capabilities, as well as his extensive knowledge of and connections within the wider jihadist movement. In the past, al-Zawahiri has been instrumental in shaping al Qaeda's messaging and has frequently issued statements and videos calling for attacks against the U.S. and its allies. With his ascension to the top leadership position, al-Zawahiri is likely to continue utilizing propaganda to recruit and radicalize followers, as well as to inspire lone-wolf attacks and homegrown terrorists in an effort to maintain al Qaeda's relevancy and influence in a constantly changing global landscape. Additionally, under his directive, the terrorist organization may seek to reestablish ties with various affiliate groups, such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), al-Shabaab in Somalia, and Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria, in order to strengthen its overall network and create a more unified front against perceived enemies. Furthermore, the appointment of al-Zawahiri also signals the continuing resilience and adaptation of al Qaeda in the face of ongoing counterterrorism efforts by the U.S. and its allies. Despite the significant setbacks suffered by the organization, such as the loss of its founder and multiple high-ranking operatives in recent years, al Qaeda remains a potent ideological and operational force within the broader jihadist movement. As the group faces growing competition from other extremist factions, such as ISIS, al-Zawahiri's leadership may see a renewed emphasis on high-profile, large-scale terror attacks in an attempt to reassert al Qaeda's dominance in the global jihadist movement and to demonstrate its capabilities to potential followers and supporters. In response to al-Zawahiri's appointment, the U.S. and its allies are likely to continue their concerted efforts to track, monitor, and ultimately neutralize key al Qaeda figures and operational nodes. Additionally, the intelligence community will work diligently to stay abreast of any potential shifts in strategy or tactics brought about by al-Zawahiri's leadership and adapt counterterrorism measures accordingly. Ultimately, while al-Zawahiri's rise to power may instigate new challenges in the fight against al Qaeda, it also presents opportunities for security and intelligence agencies to gain valuable insights into the inner workings of the group and its evolving plans and objectives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Aim of this study was to examine the benefits of oxygenated HMP after static cold storage (SCS).', 'Eighteen ECD livers that were declined for transplantation underwent ex situ viability testing using normothermic (37 °C) machine perfusion (NMP) after traditional SCS (0 °C-4 °C) for 7 to 9 hours. In the intervention group (n = 6), livers underwent 2 hours of oxygenated HMP (at 12 °C) after SCS and before NMP. Twelve control livers underwent NMP without oxygenated HMP after SCS.', 'During HMP, hepatic ATP content increased greater than 15-fold, and levels remained significantly higher during the first 4 hours of NMP in the HMP group, compared with controls. Cumulative bile production and biliary secretion of bilirubin and bicarbonate were significantly higher after HMP, compared with controls. In addition, the levels of lactate and glucose were less elevated after HMP compared with SCS preservation alone. In contrast, there were no differences in levels of hepatobiliary injury markers AST, ALT, LDH, and gamma-GT after 6 hours of NMP. Hepatic histology at baseline and after 6 hours of NMP revealed no differences in the amount of ischemic necrosis between both groups. Answer: Two hours of oxygenated HMP after traditional SCS restores hepatic ATP levels and improves hepatobiliary function but does not reduce (preexisting) hepatobiliary injury in ECD livers.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -53 - 42 = -14*x + 3 for x.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this step by step like a little story: We have this equation: -53 - 42 = -14*x + 3 Step 1: Let's first figure out what -53 - 42 is. Imagine you have 53 apples that you owe someone. Now you need to give them 42 more apples. How many apples do you owe them in total? -53 - 42 = -95. Now our equation looks like this: -95 = -14*x + 3 Step 2: Let's move the +3 to the other side of the equation. It's like taking 3 apples away from what you owe, so you owe 3 less apples now. To do that, subtract 3 from both sides: -95 - 3 = -14*x. Now we get: -98 = -14*x Step 3: Now we just need to find out how many times -14 goes into -98 to get the value for x. Let's see: -98 divided by -14 is 7. So, x = 7. And that's our solution! x = 7 in this math problem. Good job!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is also influenced by late-1970s funk music, and it contains elements of soul music as well as dance-pop music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of G minor with a time signature in common time, and a moderate groove of 106 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of D♯4 to F5. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, and horns. A non-live instrument, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic disco beat. Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are \\"silky smooth\\" and that her vocal range leans toward the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that \\"Déjà Vu\\" is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" (1980). The title refers to the déjà vu phenomenon. The lyrics to \\"Déjà Vu\\" follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern, and feature two rap verses. It is hook-laden, similar in this respect to \\"Crazy in Love\\". The lyrics detail a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover, shown in the lines, \\"Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?\\" As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, slides into the main two-bar ostinato. Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.After that Beyoncé mentions Jay-Z, the bass glides up for a vibrato-rich fill, giving way to the first rap. Backgrounded with a repeating groove, Beyoncé starts the first verse. The pre-chorus follows, for which the bass changes to a more melodic tone \\"to play something more singing\\",...

Answer the above question based on the context below: The seventh and eighth major Nine Inch Nails studio-releases, Ghosts I–IV and The Slip, were released in March and May 2008 respectively. Both albums feature contributions from live-band member Alessandro Cortini. Since the release of Ghosts I–IV, a 25-date tour was announced in several North American cities. Cortini and Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band. The lineup was initially to include Rich Fownes, but before any scheduled performances it was revealed that Justin Meldal-Johnsen would instead be contributing on bass guitar. Supporting acts for the tour include Deerhunter, Crystal Castles, Does It Offend You, Yeah?, Ghostland Observatory, A Place to Bury Strangers, and White Williams. In early June, a tour EP was released for free on the Nine Inch Nails website featuring four songs from the supporting artists and one from Nine Inch Nails. The files are DRM-free MP3s that are fully tagged, and included with the download are desktop wallpapers and a printable tour poster. The band headlined the 2008 Lollapalooza festival, the 2008 Virgin Festival, and the first Pemberton Music Festival. In May 2008, Nine Inch Nails announced that premium seating for all the upcoming 2008 tour shows would be offered in a pre-sale for fans who registered at the official Nine Inch Nails website. In an effort to combat ticket scalpers, each concert ticket will list the purchaser's legal name. The ticketing process was previously used for smaller pre-sales and was available exclusively to fan club members. On July 26, Reznor introduced an \\"unplugged\\" portion into the live show in which the band steps to the front of the stage about an hour into the show, with Reznor on vibraphone and bassist Meldal-Johnsen playing an upright bass. The 20-minute jazzy, acoustic set is taken mostly from Ghosts I - IV. The stage show also featured mesh LED curtains that projected various visuals, ranging from falling rain to static to a ruined city, and made the band appear to be playing on...

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which would be lighter, item A or item B? John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. Hint: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... A:","completion":"Item A, which is labeled as Earth, would be heavier when compared to item B, which is a sample of the surface rock. The reasoning behind this assumption stems from the information provided in the given paragraph. The paragraph mentions several relevant points, such as Earth's mass is higher than surface rocks and deeper materials are denser, implying item A is heavier. Moreover, the Earth's core is composed of dense substances like an alloy of iron and other minerals, contributing to its mass. The specific gravity of the Earth is also higher than the rocks on the surface. All these points collectively suggest that item B, the surface rock, would be lighter compared to item A, which represents the Earth. So, the answer is: Item B is lighter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Write a summary based on this article: Charlie Sheen Exposing Sex Partners to HIV is a Crime EXCLUSIVE Charlie Sheen could have some big legal problems with the revelation he has HIV, because in California it's a crime for someone to have unprotected sex when that person knows he or she is infected with HIV. Charlie has not said if he's had unprotected sex, but as we previously reported we know he's settled several cases with people who were unaware of his HIV status and had sex with him. If he did have unprotected sex, under California law, he could get 6 months in jail. The law is clear ... anyone with a communicable disease who \\"willfully exposes another person\\" is guilty. There was a case this past March in which a San Diego man was convicted of the crime for willfully exposing his boyfriend to HIV. He was later sentenced to 6 months in jail. The stakes are higher if someone knows they have HIV and has sex with another person with the intent to transmit the disease ... then it's a felony punishable by a maximum of 8 years in prison.

The infamous Insein Prison is in which Asian country?","completion":"The infamous Insein Prison is located in Myanmar, also known as Burma, which is a Southeast Asian country. Myanmar, bordered by Bangladesh, India, China, Laos, and Thailand, has a tumultuous history involving military rule, political instability, and human rights abuses. Insein Prison has played a significant role in this history and gained notoriety as a symbol of the government's brutal oppression. Insein Prison, situated in Yangon's outskirts, approximately 9.5 miles (15 kilometers) from the city center, was established by the British colonial government in the 19th century. The prison was initially designed to accommodate around 5,000 inmates but, over the years, its population has swelled to nearly 10,000 prisoners due to overcrowding. Over the decades, Insein Prison has housed a multitude of political dissidents, activists, journalists, and intellectually persecuted, who have been imprisoned for expressing opinions, advocating for democracy, or criticizing the government in Myanmar. From the early days of its military dictatorship in 1962 to the recent events following the February 2021 coup, Insein Prison has been used to silence critics and hold them without proper trials, often in deplorable conditions. Conditions inside Insein Prison have been documented to be horrendous, with inmates subjected to inhumane treatment, such as beatings, torture, malnutrition, and inadequate healthcare. Prisoners often suffocate due to the extreme overcrowding, which has led the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other humanitarian organizations to express grave concerns about their wellbeing. Many prominent political figures have spent time at Insein Prison, including Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD), who was arrested several times during her political career. Despite recent efforts to reform Myanmar's political landscape and a shift towards democracy, Insein Prison remains an enduring emblem of the country's repressive past and a reminder of the ongoing struggles for human rights and freedom in Myanmar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make sure that you can discern between the active pills (which suppress your period) and the placebo pills (which trigger a week of withdrawal bleeding). Use a calendar to chart out your birth control schedule for the weeks leading up to the period that you want to skip. Monophasic pills cause less spotting than multiphasic pills, making them better suited to skipping periods. However, you can still skip a period using multiphasic pills. Ask your gynecologist about which pills you can skip in order to miss your period. If you aren't already on a birth control program, speak to your gynecologist about starting. Only take birth control pills that you've been prescribed by a licensed physician. If you are taking monophasic pills, then you just need to take the same pill every day. If you are using multiphasic pills, then you'll need to be careful to keep to the schedule. If you aren't sure, ask your gynecologist for advice on how to proceed. If your birth control is packaged with a \\"period week\\" of placebo pills, feel free to discard the placebos. They are sugar pills, and you won't need them if you are going to skip your \\"period.\\" Skip the placebo pills. Begin the next month's birth control packet immediately at the end of the regular three-week regimen. Make sure that you are ready with the new pills as the three-week mark approaches! Remember: if you're taking birth control, you are not actually getting your period on the fourth \\"placebo\\" week of the month. The bleeding that occurs is \\"withdrawal bleeding\\" as your body responds to stopping the hormones. Withdrawal bleeding does not pose a serious risk to your health and skipping withdrawal bleeding does not affect your health. It is safe to skip your period indefinitely using hormonal birth control. You may experience minimal spotting. However, this should not last more than a day. Monophasic pills are more stable than multiphasic pills, and thus less likely to trigger spotting. If you've been taking the pills for three or more weeks, you can pause to take a period whenever it's convenient. Simply stop taking your active birth control pills for four days. Then, start taking the active pills again. Consider taking up to a week's break from your contraceptive after any skipped withdrawal period. It's good to give your body a rest.

Ah, the airport... not only has flying become more of a hassle throughout the years, but food places in the airport always seem to rub me the wrong way. After taking belts, shoes, and jackets off and being body scanned, all you want is a relaxing beer right? I was looking for a drink and some food before my delayed flight to Chicago and found this place in the B terminal of CLT Douglas. The server was super nice and I ordered a Bad Penny (Big Boss - Raleigh, NC). It would have been my last \\"Carolina brew\\" before heading out to my destination. Ordered a standard Fish & Chips to go along with my beer. It took a while for the food to come out, but unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait. The fish seemed it was of the breaded and frozen variety and the coleslaw side it came with had stringy mayo sauce on it. I did not want to get sick so I left the coleslaw alone, but it seems like it was left under a heat-lamp too long. The fries were much like the fish... came from a bag and frozen. The whole dining experience was less than enjoyable and to top it all off the dish was 14!! I can understand my frozen meal being below 10, but 14 should get me some freshness at least! Anyways.. my bottled beer ended up being the price of a six pack so my total bill for this meal came out to about 25 bucks. Yikes. Good thing you have a captive audience here. I will stick to just drinking drafts... and maybe at another venue.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is negative. The person is not happy with the food, the service, the price, and the overall experience at the airport restaurant. They didn't enjoy the fish and chips, thought the coleslaw looked unsafe to eat, and felt that the prices were too high for the quality of food they received.

Please answer this question: In which classic book and film does the character Miss Trunchbull appear?","completion":"Miss Agatha Trunchbull, or simply Miss Trunchbull, is a character in the classic children's book \\"Matilda,\\" written by British author Roald Dahl and first published in 1988. The book has been adapted into several audio, stage, and screen productions, including the noted 1996 film directed by Danny DeVito, in which Miss Trunchbull is played by actress Pam Ferris. \\"Matilda\\" tells the story of an extraordinary young girl with telekinetic powers named Matilda Wormwood, who has a passion for reading and an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Unfortunately, she is neglected by her shallow and selfish parents. Miss Trunchbull is the tyrannical and abusive headmistress of Crunchem Hall, the primary school attended by Matilda. The character is known for her intimidating, cruel demeanor and her extreme disdain for children. Miss Trunchbull is a former Olympic hammer thrower, which she uses to her advantage by incorporating her physical prowess into her acts of discipline and intimidation. This cruel headmistress is notorious for employing unusually harsh and even dangerous disciplinary methods, such as locking disobedient students in \\"The Chokey,\\" a narrow, dark closet filled with sharp objects. In both the book and the movie, Miss Trunchbull's reign of terror is ultimately challenged when Matilda discovers her otherworldly abilities, using them to protect her kind-hearted and supportive teacher Miss Honey, as well as her fellow students. Matilda's intelligence, cunning, and newly found telekinetic powers ultimately lead to Miss Trunchbull's defeat and her disappearance from Crunchem Hall, paving the way for a better learning environment and a happier life for Matilda and the other children at the school. The enduring popularity of \\"Matilda\\" and its adaptations can be attributed to its timeless themes, such as the triumph of good over evil, the power of love and friendship, and the importance of education and standing up against adversity. Miss Trunchbull, as the ruthless and brutal antagonist, serves as a stark contrast to Matilda's kind and nurturing nature, creating a dynamic and captivating story that remains beloved by readers and audiences to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Where might customers go to walk around? Options: - mall - park - market - found in restaurant - bookstore The answer is \\"mall\\" because","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the options given In order to find the best answer, let's analyze each of the options given: 1. Mall: A place with multiple stores, restaurants, and services where customers can shop, socialize, and enjoy various activities. 2. Park: A public outdoor space, mainly used for recreation, where people can play sports, have picnics, or go for walks. 3. Market: A location where vendors gather to sell goods, typically including various types of food and other items. 4. Found in restaurant: This option seems invalid, as it is not a clear option or location that people can visit to walk around. 5. Bookstore: A place where customers can purchase and peruse books, but not specifically meant for walking around. Step 2: Eliminate options based on criterion The question specifically asks for a place where customers might go to walk around. From the options given, we can eliminate \\"found in restaurant\\" immediately, as it is not a valid option or location. Step 3: Compare the remaining options After eliminating the invalid option, we are left with the mall, park, market, and bookstore. Considering the question focuses on customers (which would imply shopping or spending money), this criterion narrows it down to places that primarily cater to shopping or purchasing activities. Step 4: Determine the best answer Between the mall, market, and bookstore, the answer is \\"mall\\" because it provides a more comprehensive venue for customers to both shop and walk around. While the market and bookstore are also possibilities, they typically don't offer the variety and extent of spaces that a mall does. The mall offers more opportunities for customers to explore multiple stores, engage in leisure, and socialize, making it a prime location for walking around."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let me give you two ideas so you can decide which one is better! 1. Make the litter box like a playground: If we make the litter box more fun, the cat might use it more. We can put new toys inside or even change the kind of litter. 2. Be patient and show the way: Sometimes, cats need time to learn. We can gently take the cat to the litter box often, and when she uses it right, we can give her rewards like hugs or treats. Between these two ideas, number 2 is a better solution. It's because cats need to feel comfortable and learn how to use the litter box properly.

This is a smaller version of one of the best engines Ford ever built. It was dropped because it did not sell in big numbers, so availability of some parts is not as good as it is for the 2.5 and 3.0 V6s. It has a timing chain, so there's no timing belt to worry about.

At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C. By 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference. The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport. The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door. Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing.

Step 6: Encourage foraging by hiding small pieces of food around the cage to mimic their natural behavior. Step 7: Provide clean, fresh water daily. Make sure the water dish is clean and filled with fresh water at all times. Step 8: Adjust portion sizes depending on the bird's size and activity level.

Answer:","completion":"The announcement of a vague 'Dominion Status' for India in 1929 can be traced back to Lord Irwin, the then Viceroy of India. Lord Irwin, also known as Edward Frederick Lindley Wood or the 1st Earl of Halifax, was a prominent British Conservative politician who was appointed Viceroy of India in 1926 and held the position until 1931. To understand the context of this announcement, we must go back to the events leading up to it. During this period, India was witnessing a surge in its freedom struggle, with the Indian National Congress (INC) and various other political organizations demanding complete independence from British rule. The British government, feeling the pressure, decided to initiate constitutional reforms in India. In 1928, the Simon Commission, a British parliamentary delegation led by Sir John Simon, was sent to India to study the existing political situation and recommend constitutional reforms. However, the commission was met with severe backlash since it did not contain any Indian members, which led to widespread protests throughout India. In an attempt to manage the unrest and bring about some common ground, on 31st October 1929, Lord Irwin made an ambiguous statement suggesting future Dominion Status for India. This move aimed to pacify the demands of the Indian nationalists and served as a step towards transferring power and allowing a degree of self-governance to the country. Dominion Status implied that India would remain under the British Crown but would enjoy a considerable level of autonomy in its internal affairs. However, the announcement was not well-received by the Indian political leaders. They found it to be vague and unsatisfactory, as it failed to provide a clear timeline, no specific details regarding the proposed Dominion Status or a concrete plan of action. Instead of appeasing the nationalists, Lord Irwin's announcement further fueled the demand for complete independence. In December 1929, under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru, the Indian National Congress declared 'Purna Swaraj' or total independence from British rule as their ultimate goal and decided to celebrate 26th January 1930 as the first Independence Day. In conclusion, Lord Irwin's announcement of unclear Dominion Status for India in 1929 was an attempt to address the escalating tension between the Indian nationalists and the British government. However, it not only failed to placate the freedom fighters but also intensified their resolve to achieve complete independence from British rule."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One night, Old Major, the prize boar and the second-oldest on the farm, calls the animals on the farm for a meeting, where he compares the humans to parasites and encourages them to break free from their tyrant's influence, while reminding them that they must hold true to their convictions after they have gained freedom.

Primarily known for her work in Hindi films, she has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and English language films. One of the most popular and highest-paid actresses in India, Basu is the recipient of numerous accolades, including one Filmfare Award, among six nominations. Particularly known for her work in the thriller and horror film genres, she is frequently cited in the media as a sex symbol. One of the judges of the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest in which Basu participated, Vinod Khanna, wanted to launch her alongside his son Akshaye Khanna in Himalay Putra, but she felt she was too young and declined the role, which eventually went to Anjala Zaveri. After returning home, she was convinced by Jaya Bachchan to star opposite her son Abhishek Bachchan in J. P. Dutta's Aakhari Mughal. However, the film was cancelled, and Dutta instead changed the script and made Refugee with Kareena Kapoor. Basu was also offered a role in Refugee opposite Sunil Shetty, which she declined. In 2001, Basu finally made her debut opposite Akshay Kumar in Vijay Galani's Ajnabee. The film, directed by Abbas-Mustan, was inspired by the American film Consenting Adults. It was a moderate box-office success and attracted unfavorable reviews from critics. However, Basu's performance in a negative role was appreciated by critics and won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. In 2002, Basu starred in the year's most successful thriller, Raaz. Directed by Vikram Bhatt, it established Basu in the Hindi film industry. Her portrayal of a woman who is pursued by a spirit received positive reviews. One review in The Tribune noted, \\"... it is Bipasha Basu who steals the show with her fine performance.\\" She was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for Raaz. She was appreciated in a supporting role in Sanjay Gadhvi's Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai, a moderate critical and commercial success. However, in David Dhawan's Chor Machaaye Shor, was her first commercial failure. She appeared in a supporting role opposite Mahesh Babu and Lisa Ray in the Telugu film, Takkari Donga. Gunaah, which released later that year, was also a box-office failure. She played the role of a cop who loves a convict and tries to reform him.

Is \\"Restaurants specializing in the regional cuisines of Mexico's 31 states are available in the city.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What are some international cuisines offered in Mexico City?\\"","completion":"While it is true that restaurants in Mexico City specialize in the cuisines of Mexico's 31 states, it does not completely address the question. The question is asking about \\"international cuisines,\\" which refers to food styles or dishes that originate from countries outside of Mexico. As such, your answer is correct in the context of intra-national cuisine, but it does not specifically tackle international cuisines. Mexico City, being a bustling metropolis and a global city, is indeed home to an impressive variety of international cuisines from all parts of the world, in addition to its regional Mexican foods. It is a cosmopolitan city with a diverse food scene that reflects its multicultural population and its function as a hub for international travel and commerce. Firstly, restaurants in Mexico City offer numerous Latin American cuisines other than Mexican. Examples of these are Brazilian, Argentinian, Peruvian, and Cuban cuisines. This can be attributed to the close geographical and cultural ties between Mexico and these Latin American countries. In terms of European cuisine, you can find a wide array of options in Mexico City, particularly Spanish, French, and Italian restaurants. This is due to historical connections and migrations from these countries. Spanish tapas bars, French bistros, and cozy Italian trattorias are all commonly found throughout the city. Asian cuisines are also well represented in Mexico City. Notably, Japanese and Chinese restaurants are popular, and there are also several places where one can sample Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisines. This is a reflection of the burgeoning Asian population in the city, as well as the growing global appeal of Asian cuisines. Middle Eastern food is also quite popular, particularly Lebanese cuisine, which has been present in Mexico City for many decades due to a substantial Lebanese diaspora. Additionally, there are also Indian, Turkish, and Israeli restaurants among others. American fast food chains, offering everything from burgers to pizza to fried chicken, are ubiquitous around the city due to globalization and the close proximity between Mexico and the United States. To sum up, Mexico City embraces a vast spectrum of international cuisines, from Latin American to European, from Asian to Middle Eastern, offering residents and visitors an unlimited culinary journey around the world.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Sharpe was buried next to? On 27 July 1843 Sharpe married Elizabeth Fletcher, second sister of John Fletcher, at Bolton Parish Church. The couple had five children: Francis in 1845, Edmund junior (known as Ted) in 1847, Emily in 1849, Catherine (known as Kate) in 1850, and Alfred in 1853.When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47. The seven years he spent there were later described, in a Memoir published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as \\"perhaps the happiest years of his life\\". The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called Bron Haul near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the A5 road. Two years later he bought a larger property called Coed-y-Celyn on the east bank of the River Lledr, about a mile south of Betws-y-Coed. After moving to Geneva, the family lived for about three years in a rented property called Richemont on the road from Geneva to Chêne-Bougeries. Finally in 1866 the family moved back to Lancaster to live in Scotforth, then a small village to the south of the town.Elizabeth Sharpe died on 15 March 1876, a month after the consecration of St Paul, Scotforth where a plaque to her memory can be found in the chancel of the church. A year later, Sharpe travelled to northern Italy with his two daughters, his youngest son Alfred, and three research assistants, to make drawings of 12th-century churches in the region. During the trip he became seriously ill with a chest infection and died on 8 May, in or near Milan. His body was taken to Lancaster, where he was buried on 19 May, alongside his wife, in the municipal cemetery. \\"Glowing obituaries\\" were carried by the local newspapers and the architectural press, including The Builder, The Building News, and The Architect. His estate was valued at \\"under £14,000\\" (equivalent to £1,290,000 as of 2018).

As the context explicitly states that Baby Bash is a rapper and provides no information that associates him with being an opera singer, it appears reasonable to deduce that Baby Bash is likely not an opera singer. Step 5: Evaluate the hypothesis with rational thinking. Given that Baby Bash is described as a rapper, the genre he belongs to is unrelated to opera singing. Although one could argue that artists can branch out into different genres, the context does not provide any relevant information about Baby Bash participating in opera singing. Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the context, we can draw the hypothesis that Baby Bash is not an opera singer. The context focuses on his career as a rapper and does not mention any involvement in opera singing activities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reviewer enjoyed the product/service and would likely recommend it. ★★★★★ (5 stars) – Represents a truly exceptional or perfect experience.

As \\"Lay bhaari\\" can be seen as a positive statement, but not necessarily the absolute best (since it's hard to tell what level of enthusiasm the reviewer intends with this phrase), I would assign a ★★★★ (4-star) rating to this review.

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date.

Paragraph: With a budget of 329 million, LSC provides civil legal assistance to low-income people in every county in America, Kleiman said. NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said.

Answer:","completion":"To answer the question \\"what describes behaviors that improve fitness?\\", we should consider the following steps: 1. Understand the context: The statement provided mentions that behaviors that improve fitness increase through Darwinism. This means these behaviors are beneficial for a species' survival and reproduction, hence increasing their prevalence in the population over time. 2. Define fitness: In the context of Darwinism, fitness refers to an organism's ability to survive, reproduce, and pass on its genes to the next generation. 3. Identify behavior types: There are various behaviors that can improve fitness, such as finding food, avoiding predators, adapting to environmental changes, and attracting mates. These behaviors are context-dependent, so the importance of each specific behavior will vary based on the species and its environment. 4. Assess the given answer: \\"Staying warm\\" is a behavior that can improve fitness for certain species, particularly in colder environments or for ectothermic animals (like reptiles), where maintaining body temperature is crucial for their survival and reproduction. So, the correct answer depends on the species and context being considered.

But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him.

Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"No, the suggested answer does not accurately address the question at hand. The question is asking for an analysis of how Gilgamesh views his own immortality. It is not about the friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu. The friendship plays an important role in the story, but it is not directly related to Gilgamesh's perception of his immortality. A more appropriate answer would delve into the Epic of Gilgamesh's exploration of the theme of immortality. Initially, Gilgamesh considers himself an exceptional, almost god-like figure due to his extraordinary strength, achievements, and his semi-divine heritage. However, after Enkidu's death, Gilgamesh becomes acutely aware of his own mortality and embarks on a quest for literal immortality. During this quest, Gilgamesh encounters Utanapishtim, the only human to have been granted immortality by the gods. Despite efforts to achieve it himself, Gilgamesh ultimately learns some valuable truths about immortality and the human condition. Through a series of tests and failures, he realizes that he cannot attain immortality the same way Utanapishtim did. He begins to adopt a more nuanced view of immortality, emphasizing a person's legacy rather than the ability to avoid death entirely. Gilgamesh learns that a king's lasting reputation and impact on humanity are more essential than attempting to defy the natural order of life and death. Thus, while the friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu is a central aspect of the story, Gilgamesh's perception of his immortality is more accurately explored by analyzing his quest and the lessons he learns from it. The suggested answer does not address this central component of the story, so it should not be validated as a complete and accurate answer to the question."},{"prompt":"This article: Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response.

Please answer the following question: What right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation? Answer the above question based on the context below: St Botolph's Church is an Anglican place of worship in the village of Quarrington, part of the civil parish of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, England. The area has been settled since at least the Anglo-Saxon period, and a church existed at Quarrington by the time Domesday was compiled in 1086, when it formed part of Ramsey Abbey's fee. It was granted to Haverholme Priory about 1165, and the Abbey claimed the right to present the rector in the 13th century. This right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century, and then passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50. Recognised for its age and tracery, the church has been designated a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle ending at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the reticulated designs. Answer:","completion":"The right claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation was the right to present the rector for St Botolph's Church in Quarrington. This right pertains to the appointment of a religious authority, such as a priest or minister, to a particular parish or church within the diocese. Prior to this, during the 13th century, the right to present the rector belonged to Ramsey Abbey. However, as the English Reformation came about in the early 16th century, this right transitioned to the Bishop of Lincoln. The reformation, a series of political and religious changes, led to the dissolution of monasteries, and the power dynamics within the Church shifted significantly during this time. The Bishop of Lincoln managed to obtain this right amidst the ecclesiastical turmoil, asserting a greater degree of control over local religious appointments in the area. Ultimately, this right of presentation did not remain with the Bishop of Lincoln indefinitely. It later passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. This demonstrates how the coveted right to present rectors evolved throughout the centuries, shifting from one authority figure to another as political and religious landscapes changed over time. In the context of St Botolph's Church, the right to present the rector played a significant role in shaping the church's history and operations. As the leaders who were appointed might have held varying perspectives and priorities, their influence likely impacted the community and the development of the church. The church's grade II* listed designation, unique architectural elements, and ongoing role in the Ecclesiastic Parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford reflect a rich past in which the right to present rectors played a central part."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who wanted to start the tour right away? , can you please find it? In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently...

This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction.

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

She was a bit hysterical afterwards, obviously, and I was just trying to calm her down,” said Jones, 29, an Australian who’s been in Canada for six months. Alex Thomas said she wasn’t sure how she fell, although a witness has told CBCNews.ca that the Canadian woman was hit first by rioters and then pushed over by riot police trying to clear the street after rampant vandalism and looting spread through the downtown streets following the Vancouver Canucks' Game -7 Stanley Cup loss to the Boston Bruins. “Tripped up? I’m not sure. I was starting to get really frightened because I’d never experienced anything like that before, and it’s really scary,” Thomas told CBC News. “I was upset, and I fell down, and didn’t really know exactly what was happening.\\" Jones said they had been trying to get out of the downtown area but found themselves on a street filled with police in riot gear. Photos gone viral “They were literally charging at us and we tried to run away,” he said. Neither Thomas nor Jones blames the police for what happened, but understand they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. “[The police] were doing their job,” Thomas said. Jones has been working as a bartender and trying to break into acting and standup comedy. At least one of his comedy routines has been posted on YouTube. Following the Canucks' loss to the Boston Bruins, images of the kissing couple surrounded by riot police were splashed around the world. On Twitter, Facebook and other social media, there was early speculation that the picture was staged. CBC.ca immediately launched a search to uncover the identity of the two. Hannah Jones, Scott's sister from Perth, told CBC News earlier Friday in an email that the man in the pictures is her brother, and he recently started dating Thomas, a former student at the University of Guelph in Ontario. The two are overwhelmed by all the coverage the picture has gotten, she said, fielding calls from media around the world.

Review: Horror Gods Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any Genre-lover to watch a film, and, even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little Sci-Fi/Horror gem. While Lambert Hillyer's \\"The Invisible Ray\\" of 1936 does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring Karloff (\\"Frankenstein, \\"Bride Of Frankenstein\\", \\"The Mummy\\",...) or Lugosi (\\"White Zombie\\", \\"Island Of The Lost Souls\\", \\"Dracula\\",...), or both (\\"The Black Cat\\", \\"The Raven\\",...), this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing. Compared to other Universal Horror pictures, the storyline seems a bit silly, but in a delightful manner. Karloff and Lugosi, of course, shine as always, and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography. Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh, a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope, and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago. Stunned by Rukh's invention, the celebrated French scientist Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi), invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor. In Africa, Rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike... It is somewhat odd that Karloff, who was in fact British, plays a Hungarian scientist here while Lugosi, who was Hungarian, plays a French Scientist, but they are both excellent as usual. As far as I am concerned, these two Horror Deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory, and I am sure they would have made something out of it - either man is an icon of the Horror genre, and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre. By the way, this is one of the few films, if not the only one, in which it is obvious that Lugosi was actually taller than Karloff. Frances Drake makes a very good female lead in her role of Dr Rukh's beautiful young wife. The rest of the performances are also good, if not particularly worth mentioning. Other than the casting of Karloff and Lugosi, the film's greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography, as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline. My main complaint is that I would have wished for more screen time for Lugosi, and for his role to have a bit more significance. He is fantastic as always, but his role could have been bigger, and more sinister. Otherwise, \\"The Invisible Ray\\" is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic Horror/Sci-Fi cinema, and a must-see for all my fellow Lugosi/Karloff fans.

If \\"An angry looking man in a green Seattle Seahawks hoodie leans on a railing.\\", does this mean that \\"The man just watched the 2015 Superbowl.\\"?","completion":"No, it is not accurate to assume that the man just watched the 2015 Superbowl simply because he's an angry looking man in a green Seattle Seahawks hoodie leaning on a railing. This statement is limited in information, and it is possible that his anger and choice of clothing are unrelated to the 2015 Superbowl. Here, let's break down this assumption using various factors: 1. Timeframe: The scenario does not provide any temporal context. Although the 2015 Superbowl did occur, without any specified time, connecting the man's emotional state to that particular event is speculative. 2. Reason for Emotion: Many factors can contribute to someone's anger. The man could be angry for reasons entirely separate from the Seattle Seahawks or football, such as a personal problem, work-related stress, or an unrelated event that he has just experienced. 3. Clothing: Wearing a hoodie representing a particular sports team is common among fans, but it doesn't necessarily tie the wearer to a specific event or season. People wear team merchandise for various reasons, including supporting the team in general, liking the design, or even receiving it as a gift. 4. Location: The scenario does not provide any details regarding the location where the man is leaning against the railing. It isn't clear if this is happening at a sports stadium, a home, or a public place. A clearer indication of the setting might provide more context, but the information is not available in the current statement. 5. Personal Support: Even if the man is a fan of the Seattle Seahawks, it is not clear if his support is attributed to specific players or events. Sports fans often feel strong emotions during games, but their emotional responses and connections to their teams can be formed for various reasons, such as personal experiences or friendships supporting the team. In summary, without further information, it is incorrect to say that the man's anger is a direct result of watching the 2015 Superbowl. The scenario is too vague and does not provide sufficient context to confirm any specific relationship between the man's emotions and that event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"A US regulator has sued 16 banks for allegedly manipulating the London interbank offered rate (Libor).\\"","completion":"Title: US Regulator Takes Legal Action against 16 Banks for Alleged Libor Manipulation Introduction A US regulator has recently filed a lawsuit against 16 major banks, accusing them of manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), a critical benchmark interest rate representing the cost of borrowing between banks and affecting a wide range of financial products around the world. The banks under scrutiny include some of the largest financial institutions such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Barclays, among others. Background on Libor Libor, an acronym for The London Interbank Offered Rate, is calculated daily by a group of leading banks that report the interest rates at which they would be willing to lend money to one another on an unsecured basis. It serves as a reference for a plethora of financial products ranging from mortgages, student loans, and credit cards to multi-billion dollar derivative contracts between large corporations. Allegations against the Banks The regulator, which has not been named, accuses the 16 banks of conspiring to manipulate the Libor in order to benefit their trading positions and inflate their profits. The lawsuit alleges that bank employees colluded with one another to submit inaccurate information about their borrowing costs to the organization responsible for calculating the Libor, resulting in a distorted rate that affected millions of consumers and investors around the world. Potential Consequences for the Banks If found guilty, these banks could potentially face massive fines and penalties imposed by the government, as well as potential claims from investors and other market participants who may have been adversely impacted by the manipulation of the Libor. Furthermore, the reputation of these banks could suffer significant damage in the eyes of the public and their shareholders, potentially resulting in a loss of customers and a decline in their stock prices. Ongoing Litigation and Investigations This recent lawsuit is not the first time that banks have been accused of manipulating the Libor. Over the past decade, several banks have admitted to misconduct in relation to the Libor and have subsequently paid billions of dollars in fines and settlements. Additionally, ongoing investigations are being conducted by financial regulators in various countries, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom, into the conduct of other banks that may have participated in similar manipulative activities. Conclusion The manipulation of the Libor by these banks, if proven true, represents a serious breach of trust and a significant ethical violation by these institutions. As the legal proceedings continue, it is crucial for financial regulators worldwide to remain vigilant in identifying and addressing potential acts of misconduct within the banking industry. This lawsuit serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring transparency and fairness within the financial markets, as well as the need to hold those who undermine these values accountable for their actions."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Is This Your New Summer Blockbuster? So I think I have an idea what you’re doing Memorial Day weekend. Netflix announced today that its season-four revival of dysfunctional-family comedy Arrested Development will premiere 15—count ‘em, 15—episodes on May 26. As with past Netflix debuts like House of Cards, the entire season will be available to subscribers the same day. Clear your calendar, stockpile food, and make arrangements to send the kids away. There are all sorts of leaks about the content and casting of the episodes out on the Internet if you’re into that sort of thing. And I’ll be writing more about the show itself in the coming weeks. For now, I’m interested in Netflix’s scheduling strategy, which has as much in common with the movies as with TV. Netflix is putting its big project live on a holiday weekend, nominally considered the start of the summer entertainment season (though, of course, “summer movie season” has gradually moved up to late April or so). Generally, summer TV shows start launching after Memorial Day weekend—in early June or into July, when people are assumed to be back home and in the living room. The Bluths, on the other hand, will be returning smack on the weekend, as if Arrested Development already were the tentpole movie blockbuster—or, in this case, block-Buster—that Mitch Hurwitz dreams of it someday becoming. Its earlier premiere scheduling also suggests a kind of movie-night strategy. House of Cards went live Friday, Feb. 1 and horror-thriller Hemlock Grove will debut Friday, Apr. 19. Fridays have become a kind of ghost town, at least for network TV, where they program cult shows, reality, reruns, or series they’re looking to burn off. Basic cable networks do some counterprogramming that night, but in general it’s not a day for big TV projects, because there’s the assumption you’ll be doing something else. Netflix, on the other hand, seems to be assuming that you’ll make time for its series on the weekend—either bingeing them or making the same appointment time in your schedule as you might for a movie. Now I don’t want to make too much of this, because you obviously consume a TV series, even on Netflix, differently from a movie. You might watch it all in one weekend, or spread out over the week, or over the course of months. Still, this is at least an example of how new forms of distribution have the potential to erode the difference between big-screen and small-screen entertainment—just as the theatrical window has shortened for movies, leading more people to watch them at home sooner. We’re not yet at the point where the window disappears—where on opening day, you can as well decide to watch the new Iron Man in IMAX or at home on your widescreen. But Netflix’s programming decisions, and delivery method, at least offer a taste of what it would be like if “opening wide” simply meant that entertainment went on sale that weekend, either at your local theater or on your set-top box. That said, we don’t know exactly how much or how quickly people’s habits will change. And neither does Netflix. Arrested Development is opening on a big holiday movie weekend, but also of note is that May 26 is a Sunday—the day people have become conditioned to turn their attention to appointment TV shows like The Walking Dead. Arrested Development, even on Netflix, is still TV—at least a little bit. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Netflix is set to release 15 episodes of the season-four revival of comedy Arrested Development on May 26, employing a scheduling strategy that echoes big movie releases rather than traditional TV series. This highlights the eroding difference between big-screen and small-screen entertainment and offers a glimpse into the potential future of entertainment consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

New Realization Understanding and processing new information can lead to a shift in your beliefs and perspectives. This dynamic process of learning often results in a new realization in one's life. New realizations can be transformative and enlightening, as they enable individuals to grow and evolve in their thinking and understanding of the world around them. New realizations can occur in different contexts, such as when one acquires more profound information about a particular subject or learns new facts that contradict previous assumptions. By embracing new realizations, individuals develop a more critical and accurate understanding of various aspects of life. For instance, a person who initially believed that certain diets were not healthful might come across new research and studies that reveal the effectiveness of these diets in promoting health and wellness. This newfound knowledge might prompt the person to reconsider their initial belief and adopt the new perspective, thus resulting in a new realization. Similarly, a person who had strong political views might be introduced to diverse opinions and historical events that provide a more nuanced and balanced understanding of the subject. In this case, the person might experience a new realization that their previous beliefs were too rigid, and they might become more open to accepting alternative opinions. In conclusion, a new realization highlights the importance of constantly acquiring and understanding new information so that our beliefs and perspectives can evolve over time to reflect a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the world around us.

Danny often caddies for Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), a free-spirited lothario, talented golfer, and the son of one of Bushwood's co-founders. Danny decides to gain favor with Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight), the country club's arrogant co-founder and director of the caddy scholarship program, by caddying for him. Meanwhile, Carl Spackler (Bill Murray), one of the greenskeepers, is entrusted with combatting a potentially disastrous gopher infestation. Throughout the film, Carl tries a variety of methods to kill the gopher (e.g. shooting, drowning) without success. Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield), a fiery, foulmouthed, disrespectful, libidinous ethnic hunk of pure nouveau riche, looked down upon by Judge Smails, begins appearing at the club. Smails is heckled by Czervik as he tees off, causing his shot to go badly wrong. Smails eventually throws a putter away in anger and accidentally injures a member of the club. Danny takes responsibility for the incident, as a ploy to gain Smails' trust. Smails encourages him to apply for the caddy scholarship. At Bushwood's annual Fourth of July banquet, Danny and his girlfriend Maggie (Sarah Holcomb) work as servers. Czervik continues to frustrate Smails with his loutish behavior, while Danny becomes attracted to Lacey Underall (Cindy Morgan), Smails' promiscuous niece. Danny wins the Caddy Day golf tournament and the scholarship, earning him praise from Smails and an invitation to attend the christening ceremony for his boat. The boat is sunk at the event after a collision with Czervik's larger boat. On returning, Smails discovers Lacey and Danny having a tryst at his house.

They are both about essay writing, but they are asking for different kinds of advice and help. 1. \\"How can we write an essay?\\" This is a general question about the process of essay writing. The use of the word \\"we\\" might suggest that the person asking the question is part of a group that needs to write an essay together, or it might simply be a more formal or polite way of asking the question. They might be looking for a step-by-step guide, a breakdown of the essay writing process, tips for how to start an essay, how to develop an argument, or how to structure an essay. Some possible answers to this question might include advice on: - Understanding the essay prompt: What is the question asking for? How can it be broken down into smaller, manageable parts? - Planning and organizing the essay: creating an outline or a plan, doing research, gathering sources, etc. - Writing drafts and revising: starting with a rough draft, refining it through revision, checking for clarity and coherence, etc. - Proofreading: checking for spelling and grammar errors, making sure citations and references are correct, etc. 2. \\"Why can't I write a good essay?\\" This question is much more personal, and it suggests that the person asking the question has been struggling with their essay writing. They might be unhappy with their past essays and are looking for reasons why they're not turning out well. They might want advice on how to improve their writing skills, how to develop their ideas more effectively, how to express themselves more clearly, etc. Moreover, this question also implies a degree of frustration and self-doubt. So, it's not just about giving practical advice about essay writing, but also about addressing these feelings of inadequacy and helping the person find ways to feel more confident about their writing. Some possible answers to this question might include: - Analyzing past essays: Looking at past work can help to identify common problems or areas for improvement. This might involve looking at organization, argumentation, use of evidence, writing style, etc. - Developing writing skills: There may be certain skills that this person needs to work on more, such as analyzing texts, developing arguments, structuring an essay, etc. - Practicing: Like any other skill, writing improves with practice. Encouragement to keep on writing and assure them that setbacks are a part of any learning process. - Seeking help: This could be from a teacher, a tutor, a writing center, etc. Sometimes an external perspective can help to see things that were missed before.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a question about this article: At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team's players is known as a formation. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.

Vidal, is the son of a famed commander who died in Morocco, believes strongly in Falangism, and has been assigned to hunt down republican rebels. A large stick insect, which Ofelia believes to be a fairy, leads Ofelia into an ancient stone labyrinth, but she is stopped by Mercedes, Vidal's housekeeper, who is secretly supporting the rebels. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom, where it becomes a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets the faun, who believes she is the reincarnation of Princess Moanna. He gives her three tasks to complete in order for her to acquire immortality. Meanwhile, Vidal murders two local farmers detained (erroneously) on suspicion of helping the rebels. Ofelia completes the first task -- retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad -- but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening.

Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, \\"It's not an acid song.\\" Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \\"Hey Jules\\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \\"Hey Jude\\". Lennon later said, \\"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -50*w - 64 = -314 for the variable w, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate w First, we need to isolate w by getting rid of any number or term that is not associated with it to one side of the equation. We can do this by adding +64 to both sides of the equation. -50*w - 64 + 64 = -314 + 64 This simplifies to: -50*w = -250 Step 2: Solve for w Now, we have to get rid of the coefficient of w, which is -50. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -50. (-50*w) / (-50) = (-250) / (-50) This simplifies to: w = 5 So, the solution to the equation -50*w - 64 = -314 is w = 5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: This article: Following the death of rancher John Dodge, foreman Gene Autry is left the responsibility of taking care of Rancho Grande ranch and Dodge's three spoiled grandchildren raised in the east. Gene is also responsible for completing a major project started by Dodge—the construction of an irrigation system that would bring valuable water to the faithful Rancho Grande employees in the southern part of the valley. Dodge mortgaged his ranch in order to finance the project. When Dodge's grandchildren, Tom, Kay, and Patsy, arrive from the east, they are unimpressed with life on the ranch. Tom and Kay are madcap college types who think ranchlife is boring and long to return to the big city. They resent Gene's authority and dismiss his talk of developing a work ethic and the importance of the irrigation project. Meanwhile, crooked lawyer Emory Benson is planning to seize the mortgage to Rancho Grande. After meeting Tom and Kay, he decides to take advantage of their discontent in order to slow the irrigation project and prevent the bank from renewing the mortgage. Gradually, Gene is able to win Kay over to his way of thinking, but Tom falls in with a group of partying tenderfoots from the east. He invites them to stay at Rancho Grande, where they get in everyone's way. Gene and his sidekick Frog Millhouse finally succeed in scaring the dudes off the ranch. Angered by Gene's actions, Tom and Kay decide to leave. When a rockslide at the irrigation project site injures Jose, a faithful Rancho Grande employee, Tom and Kay come to their senses and pledge to help complete the project on time. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who has spoiled grandchildren?, what is it ?

Statesville, North Carolina (CNN) -- Dale Beatty and John Gallina are battle buddies. They both joined the North Carolina National Guard at 18. They've served together on missions at home and abroad. But both also bear mental and physical scars from their military service in Iraq: Beatty lost his legs to an anti-tank land mine, and Gallina suffered a traumatic brain injury. While Beatty was recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, members of his community offered to help him build a home for his family. The gesture deeply affected him, inspiring a new mission. In 2008, Beatty and Gallina founded Purple Heart Homes, a nonprofit that has modified or helped provide homes to 23 disabled U.S. veterans. Closer to the end, he moved back to","completion":"Statesville, where he and Gallina continued to expand the impact of Purple Heart Homes. Their dedication and passion for helping their fellow veterans garnered attention from local, state, and national news outlets, leading to a significant increase in donations and volunteers. Over the years, Purple Heart Homes has grown into a well-respected organization with a team of specialists who work tirelessly to assist disabled veterans in need. To date, the organization has helped provide homes or modifications for over 500 disabled U.S. veterans and their families. The team focuses on tailoring each home to the specific needs of the veteran and ensuring that the result fosters a sense of independence and improved quality of life. Notably, Purple Heart Homes takes on cases that might otherwise fall through the cracks, as they not only assist veterans who have sustained physical injuries but also those suffering from mental trauma, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. The success of Purple Heart Homes attracted the attention of corporate sponsors, who saw the value in supporting an organization with a proven track record of positively impacting the lives of disabled veterans. Among these sponsors was Home Depot, which partnered with the nonprofit to provide materials and volunteer support for home renovations and adaptations. In addition to garnering corporate partnerships, Beatty and Gallina have been recognized by numerous awards. Both were named CNN Heroes in 2013, and Beatty received the Veterans of Foreign Wars' prestigious James E. Van Zandt Citizenship Award in 2016, further raising the profile of Purple Heart Homes. As the organization flourished and touched the lives of more veterans, Beatty and Gallina's commitment to their mission remained unwavering. They continued to work together, ensuring that every modification, addition, or new home met the standards of accessibility, comfort, and safety required for each veteran's unique circumstance. With many veterans and their families finally finding the stability and security they need to recover and reintegrate into civilian life, Purple Heart Homes has been acknowledged as a significant contributor to this success. Beatty and Gallina's devotion to improving the lives of disabled veterans, their families, and their communities is a testament to their outstanding commitment, love, and support to those who have served their country. Although both Beatty and Gallina acknowledge they still face their own challenges resulting from their military service, they believe that the work they do with Purple Heart Homes has been part of their healing process. By helping others overcome obstacles, the two friends have found a renewed sense of purpose and an inspiring mission that continues to make a tangible difference in the lives of disabled veterans and their families."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

A big part of being able to cope with rejection sensitivity is recognizing when it's happening. If you think you have rejection sensitivity, you will need to acknowledge your tendency to overreact to certain social situations.","completion":"One of the most logical next events after acknowledging your rejection sensitivity is to develop a plan to manage and overcome it. This plan should include coping strategies, communication techniques, and self-awareness practices that will help you better navigate social situations and improve your emotional resilience. Here is a detailed approach to help you cope with rejection sensitivity: 1. Enhance self-awareness: Developing self-awareness is crucial in managing rejection sensitivity. Keep a journal to track situations when you felt rejected or overly sensitive and analyze your emotions and triggers. Identifying patterns will help you better understand your reactions and take a more objective approach in stressful situations. 2. Learn to challenge negative thoughts: When rejection sensitivity kicks in, you may have automatic negative thoughts that contribute to your emotional distress. Implement cognitive behavioral techniques to challenge these thoughts and replace them with more rational ones. For example, if you tend to think, \\"Everyone hates me,\\" try substituting that thought with, \\"Some people might not like me, and that's okay.\\" 3. Develop healthy coping mechanisms: Engage in relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation, to help you calm down during moments of heightened sensitivity. Engaging in regular physical activity and practicing good sleep hygiene can also help improve your overall emotional health. 4. Cultivate self-compassion: Be gentle with yourself and understand that it's okay to feel vulnerable sometimes. Recognize your own worth and practice self-affirmations to build self-esteem. This can help you feel more secure and better equipped to handle situations where rejection might occur. 5. Set realistic expectations: Recognize that nobody is universally liked or successful in every social situation. Accepting this reality can help reduce the pressure you feel to be perfect or avoid negative outcomes. 6. Improve communication skills: Work on being assertive and expressing your needs, feelings, and boundaries in a clear and respectful manner. Effective communication can help reduce misunderstandings and improve your social experiences. 7. Seek social support: Connect with friends, family, or support groups who can empathize with your feelings and provide guidance or encouragement. Sharing your experiences with others can help you feel less isolated and provide fresh perspectives on dealing with rejection sensitivity. 8. Consider professional help: If your rejection sensitivity is significantly affecting your daily functioning, relationships, or mental health, consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide tailored strategies to help manage your sensitivity and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to your reactions. 9. Practice makes progress: Keep exposing yourself to social situations that challenge your fears around rejection, and aim to do so gradually. Over time, this can help you build resilience and become more comfortable in various social environments. By implementing these steps into your life, you will develop a better understanding of your rejection sensitivity and learn to navigate social situations with greater confidence and ease. Remember, managing rejection sensitivity is a journey that requires patience, self-compassion, and consistent effort."},{"prompt":"Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

One day the King sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son, to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella didn't get to go, but her stepsisters did.

Shorten led Labor at the 2016 federal election at which the Liberal/National Coalition retained majority government. - The Premier of New South Wales is the head of government in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The Government of New South Wales follows the Westminster system, with a Parliament of New South Wales acting as the legislature. The Premier is appointed by the Governor of New South Wales, and by modern convention holds office by virtue of his or her ability to command the support of a majority of members of the lower house of Parliament, the Legislative Assembly. - New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is a state on the east coast of :Australia. It borders Queensland to the north, Victoria to the south, and South Australia to the west. It has a coast line with the Tasman Sea on its east side.

Options: A. melts B. wet clothes C. move mountains D. thin blood E. take several forms The answer to this question is:","completion":"E. take several forms Water is a versatile substance that can undergo various changes based on its temperature. At different temperatures, it can take several forms, such as solid, liquid, and gas. These changes are more widely known as phase transitions. 1. Solid (ice): When the temperature of water drops below its freezing point (0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit), it turns into ice. In this state, water molecules form a crystalline structure with lower kinetic energy, making the solid rigid and not easily compressible. 2. Liquid: At temperatures between the freezing and boiling points (0-100 degrees Celsius or 32-212 degrees Fahrenheit), water is in its liquid form, which most living organisms are familiar with. In this state, water molecules are close together but have enough kinetic energy to move around. This allows water to flow and occupy the shape of its container. 3. Gas (water vapor): When water reaches its boiling point (100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit) or undergoes evaporation, it enters a gaseous state known as water vapor or steam. In this state, water molecules possess higher kinetic energy and are spread out, allowing them to move freely within the available space. In addition, water can also exist in multiple forms at once under specific conditions. For example, at the triple point (0.01 degrees Celsius or 32.018 degrees Fahrenheit and a specific pressure), water can coexist in all three states—solid, liquid, and gas—simultaneously. Moreover, water has the remarkable property of expanding when it freezes, which is unusual for most substances that typically contract during the solidification process. In conclusion, water can take several forms at different temperatures, making it a vital and unique substance on earth. Its ability to change its physical state under varying conditions contributes to its importance in numerous natural processes, such as weather patterns and the water cycle, as well as its impact on living organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You'll need to do some experimenting with both of these settings to find the ideal settings for the photo you're trying to get. The iso setting determines your camera's sensitivity to light.; (D). These settings are usually located at the bottom of the camera's box. If you haven't taken a picture or two before, you can adjust them now by turning on switch zoom up, switch aperture down and transparent sensitivity mode.;","completion":"(C). You'll need to do some experimenting with both of these settings to find the ideal settings for the photo you're trying to get. The ISO setting determines your camera's sensitivity to light. The higher the ISO setting, the more sensitive your camera will be to light, allowing it to perform better in low-light situations. However, a higher ISO setting may also result in increased digital noise, which can affect the overall image quality. In general, it's best to use the lowest possible ISO setting that will allow you to achieve the desired exposure for your photograph. Aperture, on the other hand, controls the size of the camera's diaphragm which determines the amount of light passing through the lens. This affects both exposure and depth of field, or the amount of the image that is in sharp focus. A larger aperture (designated by a lower f-stop number) will allow more light to pass through, resulting in a brighter image, but also a shallower depth of field. Conversely, a smaller aperture (indicated by a higher f-stop number) will allow less light to pass through, but will result in a greater depth of field. Experimenting with different aperture settings will help you understand the balance between exposure and depth of field, and find the ideal settings for your desired image. Once you have chosen your ISO and aperture settings, it's time to take out your light meter. A light meter is a device that measures the brightness of light in a given scene, allowing you to calculate the appropriate shutter speed for your selected ISO and aperture settings. To use a light meter, follow these steps: 1. Turn on the light meter, and make sure that it is set to read in the same units (either lux or foot-candles) as your camera. If your camera supports it, you can also set the ISO and aperture settings directly on the light meter to get more accurate readings. 2. Position the light meter in the scene you would like to photograph. For the most accurate results, hold the meter at the same angle as your camera lens, pointing in the same direction that you will be photographing. You can use a tripod or other stabilizing device to help you achieve the most precise readings. 3. Read the measurement displayed on the light meter. This is the amount of light in the scene, measured in lux or foot-candles. 4. Using this measurement, consult your camera's exposure chart, or use a photographic exposure calculator, to determine the appropriate shutter speed for your photograph. You can also use an exposure calculator app on your smartphone or tablet for quick calculations. 5. Set your camera to the calculated shutter speed, and take your photo. If the scene's lighting conditions change, be sure to take another light meter reading and adjust your shutter speed accordingly. By mastering the balance between ISO, aperture, and shutter speed using a light meter, you'll be able to consistently capture correctly exposed and visually appealing images in a variety of lighting situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After too many drinks on her 30th birthday, Rachel grabs a cab with her friend, Dex (Colin Egglesfield) and playfully reveals she has had a crush on him since law school. The problem is, Dex is also her best friend Darcy's (Kate Hudson) fiancÃ©. They wake up in bed together the next morning to Darcy calling both of their phones. Dex sneaks out before they can talk about what happened between them. Rachel initially believes the encounter is a one night stand, but it eventually develops into an ongoing affair. The couple soon find themselves lying to Darcy and others in order to cover up their relationship. Rachel tells Darcy that she is having an affair with another friend of hers, Ethan (John Krasinski) and an acquaintance, Marcus (Steve Howey) to cover up her sexual encounters with Dex. Ethan, who has been friends with Darcy and Rachel since childhood, is the only one who knows what has happened between Rachel and Dex, and reluctantly agrees to keep their secret.Meanwhile, Dex's mother (Jill Eikenberry) has been suffering from depression for some time and it seems that Dex and Darcy's wedding is the only thing keeping her sane and happy. When Dex skips out on the 4th of July weekend in the Hamptons to stay in the city and spend time with Rachel, they run into his parents. His father suspects something is going on between the two of them and he tells Dex to end it as soon as possible, saying that what he wants should not be considered a priority when it conflicts with what is right. Considering his mother and father's feelings, Dex leaves Rachel in order to go back to Darcy.As the wedding nears, Dex and Rachel are speaking less and less. At the beach, their secret is almost revealed by Ethan, who is frustrated with Rachel, especially for lying to people she cares about. That night at the bar, Rachel finally tells Dex that she wants him to call off the wedding so they can be together, but he tells her that he can't.Ethan moves to London for a job and Rachel flies out to visit him. He reveals that he loves her and just wants to see her happy, but is sad that Rachel does not reciprocate his feelings. Rachel returns to New York to find Dex sitting on her doorstep. He reveals that he ended things with Darcy and called off the wedding.Rachel is ecstatic until Darcy ends up at her door begging to come in to talk. Dex hides and Darcy enters her apartment. She tells Rachel that she has been cheating on him with his friend Marcus. She is also pregnant with Marcus' child and says that they are very happy. Rachel gives her her blessing and Darcy proceeds to leave but only to return and ask what Dex's jacket is doing in her apartment. Dex then comes out and Darcy figures out Rachel is the other woman. She becomes infuriated and storms out of the apartment, telling Rachel that she hates her.Two months later, Rachel and Darcy run into each other on the street.

Chapter One: Grief[edit] The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her. Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)[edit] During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-disemboweling fox that tells him, \\"chaos reigns.\\" Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)[edit] In the dark attic the man finds the womanâs thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest, and hidden fear. Through the autopsy and old photos, he becomes aware that she had been systematically putting Nicâs shoes on the wrong feet, resulting in pain and deformity.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The missing first step of the following process is: 1. Fill a container with saltwater. To elaborate, the entire process with the missing step included would be: 1. Fill a container with saltwater: Start by obtaining a source of saltwater, such as seawater, and filling a suitable container with it. The container should be made of a strong, heat-resistant material, such as glass or stainless steel, and should be large enough to hold the volume of saltwater needed to yield the desired amount of fresh water. 2. As the saltwater is heated, the water becomes a gas: Apply heat to the container, such as from a heat source like a stove or a hot plate. As the heat is transferred to the saltwater, the water molecules within the liquid will gain energy, and when they have enough energy, they will change from their liquid state into a gaseous state – water vapor. 3. The salt particles sink to the bottom of the container: As the water begins to evaporate, the salt particles, being unable to evaporate as the water does, become more concentrated in the remaining liquid. They eventually settle at the bottom of the container due to gravity. 4. Gaseous water is piped into another container: Use a tube or pipe connected to the first container to collect the gaseous water vapor. As the water evaporates and turns into vapor, it moves through the tube to the second container, which is kept separate from the first one to prevent any salt particles from contaminating the fresh water. 5. Allowed to cool: Once the gaseous water vapor has been collected in the second container, remove it from the direct heat source and allow it to cool. As the water vapor cools down, the water will lose energy and condense back into its liquid state, forming droplets on the surfaces of the container and slowly pooling at the bottom as fresh, liquid water. 6. The salt particles are left behind in the first container: When all of the water has evaporated from the first container and has been transferred to the second container and condensed, only the salt particles will remain. These can be discarded or used for other purposes, depending on the specific type of salt and the quality of the remaining particles. 7. The second container contains fresh water: At this point in the process, the second container should have a considerable volume of fresh water, completely free of salt and other impurities. This freshly distilled water can now be used for a variety of purposes, such as drinking, cooking, or irrigating plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

De'Andre Tatum, 18, died Thursday, his pastor and the Fort Worth Independent School District confirmed. The Fort Worth native was in a medically induced coma at the University Medical Center Brackenridge in Austin after the deadly crash. He was the last of the victims still in critical condition at the hospital. Tatum was with his girlfriend on Red River Street when police say Rashad Owens, 21, of Killeen, Texas, in the midst of a chase with police drove through a road block and into the crowd. Jamie West, 27, of Austin, and Steven Craenmehr, 35, of Amsterdam, were killed that night. More than 20 others were injured. Tatum was among eight victims transported to the hospital.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information. They are asking about which polymorph of Esomeprazole Magnesium is used to manufacture the drug Nexium. Esomeprazole Magnesium is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used to treat a range of gastrointestinal conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease and Helicobacter pylori infection, among other conditions. It works by reducing the production of stomach acid, thereby alleviating symptoms and promoting healing. Nexium is the brand name for the Esomeprazole Magnesium drug. A polymorph, in the context of pharmaceuticals, refers to a substance that has multiple crystal structures. These different crystal structures can exhibit various physical and chemical properties, such as solubility, stability, and bioavailability, which in turn can impact the drug's efficacy and safety. Polymorphs are important in the pharmaceutical industry because they allow researchers to optimize the characteristics of a drug by selecting the most appropriate crystal structure. Now, coming to your question, the polymorph of Esomeprazole Magnesium used to make Nexium is Esomeprazole Magnesium dihydrate. This polymorph was specifically chosen for its advantageous properties regarding stability and drug formulation. Esomeprazole Magnesium dihydrate is a crystalline form of Esomeprazole Magnesium that contains two water molecules per molecule of drug. This hydration confers high stability, a crucial factor in ensuring consistent drug efficacy and maintaining product quality throughout the drug's shelf life. Furthermore, this polymorph exhibits favorable solubility, which can affect the rate and extent of drug absorption in the body, and therefore, its effectiveness in treating the intended conditions. In summary, both questions are asking for the same information, which is the specific polymorph of Esomeprazole Magnesium used to make Nexium. The answer to this query is Esomeprazole Magnesium dihydrate, a stable and soluble form of the compound, advantageous for producing a safe and efficacious drug product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyze the sentence structure: The sentence is made up of two clauses connected by the coordinating conjunction \\"and.\\" The first clause is \\"I put the butterfly wing on the table\\" and the second clause is \\"it broke.\\" 3. Determine the antecedent of the pronoun \\"it\\": In the second clause, \\"it\\" is a pronoun that must have an antecedent, which is a noun or a group of words acting as a noun that the pronoun refers to. The pronoun \\"it\\" should replace a noun mentioned earlier in the sentence or context. 4. Identify the possible antecedent: Since \\"the butterfly wing\\" is the only noun mentioned earlier in the sentence, and it makes sense that a fragile object like a butterfly wing could break, \\"it\\" most likely refers to \\"the butterfly wing.\\" Based on the above analysis, I can conclude that \\"the butterfly wing\\" and \\"it\\" are the same in the given context. The pronoun \\"it\\" is being used as a replacement for \\"the butterfly wing\\" to avoid repetition and maintain sentence coherence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Select from: * unacceptable; * acceptable;...I think the answer is","completion":"acceptable. A linguist would likely rate this sentence as acceptable linguistically for several reasons. First, let's break down the most important criteria for linguistic acceptability and how this sentence meets those requirements. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases when creating sentences within a specific language. In English, the basic sentence structure typically follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern. In this case, \\"the price\\" is the subject, \\"fell\\" is the verb, and \\"of meat\\" is the object phrase. The sentence adheres to the SVO pattern, making its syntax correct and acceptable. 2. Morphology: Morphology pertains to the internal structure of words and their parts, known as morphemes. Each morpheme in this sentence is unambiguous and functions appropriately within the context. For example, \\"meat\\" is an unmarked noun representing a particular type of food, \\"price\\" is another noun describing the cost of a specific item, and the verb \\"fell\\" indicates a decrease in value. The adjective \\"the\\" determines the specificity of the noun, hinting at a particular identifiable price. All morphemes are used correctly, contributing to the sentence's acceptability. 3. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. In this sentence, the meaning is appropriately conveyed, and the relationship between the words is clear. We understand that the cost of meat has decreased, with no ambiguity or confusion. The clarity of meaning aids in its linguistic acceptability. 4. Context and pragmatics: Pragmatics deals with how context influences the interpretation of sentences. In terms of pragmatics, this sentence would be deemed linguistically acceptable. It provides relevant information, and the intended message is easily understood by the reader. In a real-life scenario, such a sentence can fit various contexts like newspapers, discussions about markets, or economic reports. 5. Lastly, the sentence follows standard punctuation and capitalization rules, further asserting its acceptability. Considering all these factors, a linguist would likely rate this sentence as \\"acceptable\\" linguistically. It adheres to the basic grammatical, syntactic, morphological, and semantic rules of the English language while also being contextually appropriate and conveying a clear meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The famous and powerful wizard Merlin (James A. Stephens) had three apprentices to whom he entrusted all of his knowledge of magic and cast spells over them to ensure they didn't age. However, one of his apprentices, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina), betrayed Merlin for his greatest enemy, the sorceress Morgana (Alice Krige). The other two apprentices, Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) and Veronica (Monica Bellucci) arrive at Merlin's stronghold in time to learn of the deception and discover that Morgana was attempting to steal a spell from Merlin's spell book that would allow her to awaken dead wizards and sorcerers and rule the world, The Rising.Morgana overpowers Merlin with Horvath's help and fatally wounds him before retrieving the evil spell. Balthazar and Veronica duel with Morgana while Horvath escapes. As a last resort, Veronica uses a spell to absorb Morgana's soul into her own body to stop her but Morgana begins to kill Veronica from the inside. To ensure Veronica's survival Balthazar traps her, with Morgana, in the Grimhold, a large nesting doll. Both facades of Veronica and Morgana are displayed on the outer shell. Before he dies, Merlin tells Balthazar that he must find the child that will be born endowed with all of his powers, the Prime Merlinian, and gives him a small, metal dragon; a symbol of his magic. The Prime Merlinian will be the only one to stop Morgana. Balthazar searches the globe for the Merlinian, with no success.

Detailed Instructions: Given an abstract, and a few options, indicate if any of the given options appropriately describe the given abstract. If any of them is a proper keyword, answer 'Yes', otherwise answer 'No'. Problem:Abstract: Drinking red wine may provoke bronchospasm in subjects with asthma. In order to reveal some of the possible agents involved in this reaction, 18 patients with a history of red wine-induced asthma were studied. They received, in a double-blind fashion, red wine with low sulfur dioxide (SO2) and high amine, high SO2 and high amine and low SO2 and low amine content. In each challenge, the wine was administered in stepwise increasing quantities until a total of 385 ml or a fall in peak expiratory flow of greater than 15% was reached. Nine subjects demonstrated a significant fall in peak flow in one or more challenges. In all cases the most severe reaction was observed after the wine with high SO2 content. The study suggests that SO2 is the most important factor in red wine-induced asthma. It is recommended that wine labels provide information on the SO2 content.

First, let's look at the equation: 0 = -10 * s + 3110 - 3050 We want to find the value of 's' that makes everything equal to zero. 1. First, let's clean up the equation by combining the numbers: 0 = -10 * s + 60 2. Now, we need to isolate 's' (get it alone on one side of the equation). We want to get rid of the 60 on the right side. To do that, we can add -60 to both sides: 0 + (-60) = -10 * s + 60 + (-60) -60 = -10 * s 3. Now, let's get 's' all by itself. Since we have -10 times 's', we will do the opposite operation: divide by -10. We'll do that to both sides: -60 / (-10) = (-10 * s) / (-10) 6 = s So, the answer is s = 6!

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who sighed at the thought of the unhappiness that this failure must cause Saint-Saëns? ? In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity....

Libyan relations with Lebanon and Shi'ite communities across the world also deteriorated due to the August 1978 disappearance of imam Musa al-Sadr when visiting Libya; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of having him killed or imprisoned, a charge he denied. Relations with Syria improved, as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad shared an enmity with Israel and Egypt's Sadat. In 1980, they proposed a political union, with Libya paying off Syria's £1 billion debt to the Soviet Union; although pressures led Assad to pull out, they remained allies. Another key ally was Uganda, and in 1979, Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders.

Holmes CENTENNIAL, Colo. — A judge here entered a not guilty plea on Tuesday for James E. Holmes, a former neuroscience student charged with killing 12 people and wounding scores more in a mass shooting in a suburban Denver movie theater. In the days before Tuesday’s hearing, the judge in the case, William B. Sylvester, had laid the groundwork for Mr. Holmes to plead not guilty by reason of insanity, describing the mental examinations and court-ordered interviews that would flow from such a plea. But Mr. Holmes’s lawyers told the court on Tuesday that they were not ready to enter any plea, and said they did not know when they might be ready. Clearly frustrated, Judge Sylvester refused the defense’s requests for more time and entered the simple not guilty plea for Mr. Holmes. Mr. Holmes, 25, was arrested moments after the July 20 shooting at the Century theaters in Aurora, clad in black body armor. Prosecutors have already presented hours of testimony and documentary evidence that Mr. Holmes was the gunman who slipped out of a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises,” armed himself in the parking lot, and then re-entered through an emergency exit and started shooting. Mr. Holmes can still change the plea, but prosecutors signaled they would fight any such move. “As far as we’re concerned, they are entering a plea of not guilty, and what they have done to this point is not sufficient to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity,” Karen Pearson, an assistant district attorney for Arapahoe County, said in court. On Tuesday, prosecutors said they would announce whether they would seek the death penalty against Mr. Holmes at an April 1 hearing. The judge set a four-week trial for the month of August. Given the delays so far in the case, that date may not hold. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1. A judge enters a not guilty plea for James E.

Question: Given the following passage \\"In 1926, Universal opened a production unit in Germany, Deutsche Universal-Film AG, under the direction of Joe Pasternak. This unit produced three to four films per year until 1936, migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of Hitler's increasing domination of central Europe. With the advent of sound, these productions were made in the German language or, occasionally, Hungarian or Polish. In the U.S., Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary's films, but at least some of them were exhibited through other, independent, foreign-language film distributors based in New York, without benefit of English subtitles.

Write an article based on this \\"There is \\"no evidence\\" some of the stones at Stonehenge that came from two Pembrokeshire quarries were excavated by man, a geologist has said.\\"","completion":"Title: Deciphering the Mysteries of Stonehenge: A Look into the Geologic Findings Introduction: Stonehenge - one of the most enduring and enigmatic prehistoric monuments in the world, has captivated and puzzled historians, archaeologists, and tourists alike for centuries. New research by a geologist suggests that there may be \\"no evidence\\" that some of the stones at Stonehenge, originating from two Pembrokeshire quarries, were excavated by humans. This latest finding adds another layer of complexity to our understanding of this ancient site and raises further questions about the methods and motivations behind the construction of Stonehenge. Step 1: Exploring the Origin of the Stones in Question: To better comprehend the implications of this claim, it is important to first explore the stones in question. Stonehenge is primarily constructed from two types of stones: large sarsen stones, and smaller bluestones. The investigation has focused on the bluestones, which have been traced back to two quarries in the Preseli Hills of Pembrokeshire, Wales - Carn Menyn and Craig Rhos-y-Felin. Step 2: Presenting the Geologist's Findings: The geologist behind this claim has studied samples of the stones at Stonehenge and the quarries in Pembrokeshire and posited that one theory suggests that glaciers might have transported the stones during the last Ice Age, rather than human transport. The absence of evidence for human excavation techniques, such as quarrying or mining, lends credibility to this natural geological theory. Step 3: Discussing the Implications of the Findings: If indeed the stones were not excavated by humans, it challenges the widely accepted theory that Stonehenge was an intentional, labor-intensive engineering feat carried out to serve a specific purpose. The presence of these stones at the site could have more to do with natural geological movements than with human intervention, which complicates our interpretation of Stonehenge's construction and its meaning. Step 4: Exploring Alternative Theories for Stonehenge's Construction: Given these findings, it becomes necessary to explore alternative theories in order to reestablish an understanding of Stonehenge's construction in human history. Whether the stones were brought to the site by glaciers or arrived through unknown human intervention, the positioning and structure of the monument still indicate that it had practical and symbolic significance for the prehistoric people who built it. Step 5: Continuing the Investigation of Stonehenge's Mysteries: Despite the latest findings proving inconclusive about the role humans played in procuring the necessary stones for Stonehenge, it is essential to continue delving deep into the mysteries of this iconic monument. New technologies and future discoveries may shed more light on the true story of Stonehenge's construction, allowing us to uncover the motivations and technical prowess of our ancestors. Conclusion: Whether the stones at the center of this captivating monument were excavated and transported by humans or arrived on the site through glacial movements, the mystery of Stonehenge endures. Through extensive research, exploration, and passionate curiosity, we inch ever closer to unlocking the secrets behind this ancient marvel and, in doing so, gain insight not just on our history but also on our capabilities as a species."},{"prompt":"Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose only child was Lisa Marie? from the following article ? Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\\" Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \\"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\\".By January 1969, the single \\"If I Can Dream\\", written for the special, reached number 12.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - In zoological nomenclature, a subphylum is a taxonomic rank below the rank of phylum. - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Starfish or sea stars are star-shaped echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea. Common usage frequently finds these names being also applied to ophiuroids, which are correctly referred to as brittle stars or \\"basket stars\\". About 1,500 species of starfish occur on the seabed in all the world's oceans, from the tropics to frigid polar waters. They are found from the intertidal zone down to abyssal depths, below the surface. - Tube feet are small active tubular projections on the oral face of an echinoderm, whether the arms of a starfish, or the undersides of sea urchins, sand dollars and sea cucumbers. They are part of the water vascular system. - The term sand dollar (or sea cookie or snapper biscuit in New Zealand, or pansy shell in South Africa) refers to species of extremely flattened, burrowing sea urchins belonging to the order Clypeasteroida. Some species within the order, not quite as flat, are known as sea biscuits. Related animals include other sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and starfish. - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\" \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\" \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives. - Eleutherozoa is a subphylum of echinoderms . They are mobile animals with the mouth directed towards the substrate . They usually have a madreporite , tube feet , and moveable spines of some sort , and some have Tiedemann 's bodies on the ring canal . All living echinoderms except Crinoidea belong here . - The madreporite is a lightcolored calcareous opening used to filter water into the water vascular system of echinoderms. It acts like a pressure-equalizing valve. It is visible as a small red or yellow button-like structure, looking like a small wart, on the aboral surface of the central disk of a sea star. Close up, it is visibly structured, resembling a \\"madrepore\\" (stone coral, Scleractinia) colony. From this, it derives its name. - Scleractinia, also called stony corals or hard corals, are marine animals in the phylum Cnidaria that live on the seabed and build themselves a hard skeleton. The individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc with a mouth and a fringe of tentacles. Although some species are solitary, most are colonial. The founding polyp settles on the seabed and starts to secrete calcium carbonate to protect its soft body. Solitary corals can be as much as across but in colonial species the polyps are usually only a few millimetres in diameter. These polyps reproduce by budding but remain attached to each other, forming a multi-polyp colony with a common skeleton, which may be up to several metres in diameter or height according to species. - Sea urchins or urchins, archaically called sea hedgehogs, are small, spiny, globular animals that, with their close kin, such as sand dollars, constitute the class Echinoidea of the echinoderm phylum. About 950 species of echinoids inhabit all oceans from the intertidal to deep. The shell, or \\"test\\", of sea urchins is round and spiny, typically from across. Common colors include black and dull shades of green, olive, brown, purple, blue, and red. Sea urchins move slowly, feeding primarily on algae. Sea otters, starfish, wolf eels, triggerfish, and other predators hunt and feed on sea urchins. Their roe is a delicacy in many cuisines. The name \\"urchin\\" is an old word for hedgehog, which sea urchins resemble. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'eleutherozoa' with the relationship of 'parent taxon'.

Article: Without the benefit of hindsight, it’s often quite difficult to know what’s motivating the other person or what they truly feel or think about you. Rather than assume they must just hate you, allow for the possibility that you’re projecting feelings that may not be there. Understand that they’re just as human as you are. Everyone has struggles in their lives that contribute to how they act--it’s entirely possible your enemy is antagonistic because of difficulties they're struggling with. Learn from the quote often attributed to Abraham Lincoln: “I don’t like that man. I must get to know him better.” Pay close attention to the people who get along with your enemy. Learn from how they handle the dynamic to gain insight into what may not be working between you and your enemy and why. If it’s a kind of behavior you’re comfortable emulating, try picking up tips from your observations to see if you can rejigger the tenor of you and your enemy's relationship. Knowing what they’re trying to achieve is crucial to dealing with the problem. Are they jealous of something you have? Did you (consciously or unconsciously) slight them in some way? Do you do something that annoys them? Knowing what’s driving their behavior can help you get out in front of their negative behavior and possibly blunt the effect their actions have on you. When you know what’s motivating the person’s behavior, you can begin to address it. You’ll have two options: improve the relationship or learn how to limit their effect on you. If it’s an issue of a small habit or behavior you have that irritates them, you can consider not doing those things around them or sitting down with them to explain your behavior and help them accept it. If it’s a more serious issue or you simply can’t figure out what their problem is, confront them about it. Nothing shuts down misconceptions or bad feelings like addressing them head-on. Apologize if it’s warranted. If you did something either knowingly or unknowingly to upset them, apologize sincerely (and don’t do it again) so you can both move on. Talk to the person calmly and coolly. Don’t accuse or antagonize, just have an honest conversation. Even if your enemy says rude or insensitive things about you, your friends, or your family, don't give them the satisfaction of seeing it upset you. In these situations, your enemy is simply looking for a reaction, and when they get one it will only encourage them to continue the behavior. If you want it to stop, start by ignoring them and their comments. Don’t listen to or spread rumors; it only perpetuates the problem. The more emotionally engaged you become, the more power you’re giving to your enemy. Avoid them. Limit your contact with them as much as possible. Sometimes distance is enough to diffuse the situation. Nothing balances the negative impact of an enemy like having allies. The more people you have on your side and who see you as kind, helpful, respectful, etc., the less impact any potential enemy sabotage can have on you. When you're tempted to say something negative about your enemy, turn that energy around and instead say something nice to another person. Spreading positivity rather than negativity will give you the advantage over your enemy. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article would be: Handling enemies in life can be challenging, but it's essential to consider the possibility that we may be projecting feelings that aren't really there. Recognizing that everyone deals with struggles can help us empathize and understand their motivations. Observing the people who get along well with your enemy can provide insights into improving your relationship. Identifying the underlying cause of their behavior aids in finding constructive solutions, which might involve making changes or confronting the issue directly. Moreover, it's important to stay calm and not react to any provocation, limit contact with the enemy, and focus on building allies and spreading positivity to minimize the negative impact your enemy may have on you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

INDIANAPOLIS -- Defense attorneys for former Jared Foundation Executive Director Russell Taylor filed dozens of pages of documents this week as part of his ongoing sentencing process. In the documents, Taylor's attorneys allege he was the victim of a psychologically abusive relationship with Jared Fogle for more than a decade. ALSO READ | Jared Fogle: What he admitted to in plea deal The documents also reveal new information about Taylor's life before Fogle, and allegations about the former Subway spokesman's conduct during Taylor's 12 years of employment with him: Personal history of abuse Taylor claims he was sexually abused by an older neighbor boy for years when he was 6-9 years old. He also claims he was molested by adult female friends of his father's when he was a teenager. Taylor also says his father and father's friends \\"bribed him with KISS trading cards\\" to leave the window blinds open in his sisters' room at night. Taylor said he wanted to go to college right after high school, but \\"my mom and pastor (stepfather) had decided the rapture was going to happen in 1989 and that I was better off studying the Bible.\\" Taylor denied being sexually attracted to children, but admitted that he has engaged in \\"swinging\\" with his wife and other couples, as well as \\"orgies.\\" Taylor claims he was part of a \\"swinger's club.\\" Psychologists who examined Taylor determined he has \\"dependent personality disorder,\\" characterized by a \\"pervasive psychological dependence on other people.\\" FBI raided Taylor's house initially in search of bestiality videos stemming from texts between him and a female friend about her running a \\"male horse farm\\" and him asking to borrow a horse to engage in sex. Taylor claims the texts were part of a running joke between the two. Taylor reported \\"horrific\\" conditions at the Marion County Jail: He claims he was fed food with cockroaches smashed inside it for days at a time. Taylor says he was handcuffed while other inmates were permitted to physically attack him. Taylor and other inmates accused of child molestation were reportedly encouraged to commit suicide and disparaged for \\"not doing it right.\\" Relationship with Jared Fogle ||||| Taylor asked for a prison sentence of 15 to almost 23 years in a court filing Friday. Russell Taylor after his arrest this year. (Photo: Indiana State Police) Lawyers for Russell Taylor described his relationship with Jared Fogle as \\"psychologically abusive,\\" and Fogle would make Taylor \\"call him Daddy,\\" according to court filings Friday. A detailed 18-page psychological assessment of Taylor, included in the filing, contained allegations that Fogle wanted Taylor to get him date-rape drugs to use on \\"kids\\" and that Fogle would say to Taylor, \\"Daddy needs some pictures.\\" Fogle, the former Subway pitchman, was sentenced to almost 16 years in prison after admitting that Taylor provided him with child pornography, some of it recorded secretly in Taylor's home. Taylor, 44, the former head of Fogle's foundation, has agreed to plead guilty to 12 counts of producing child porn and one count of distributing it. He will be sentenced Thursday in federal court in Indianapolis by the same judge who sentenced Fogle. \\"Despite contentions made by Mr. Fogle, Mr. Fogle regularly requested additional videos of the minor children be made and even offered to provide Mr. Taylor with more sophisticated equipment to do so,\\" the court filing said. \\"Mr. Fogle maintained control over Mr. Taylor's job, owned the home Mr. Taylor was living in, and provided a lavish number of experiences to Mr. Taylor. Mr. Fogle had the perfect person to carry out his sexually deviant pursuits, all the while attempting to insulate himself from the risks of the conduct.\\" A day after prosecutors asked for a 35-year prison sentence for Taylor, Taylor's lawyers asked for 15 to almost 23 years. The prosecutor's sentencing memo, filed Thursday, said Taylor provided girls younger than 16 with alcohol, illegal drugs and money \\"as part of an effort to seduce them.\\" He engaged in sex acts with two of the girls when they were 14, the document claimed. Taylor also sent text messages to a boyfriend of another 14-year-old girl, urging him to encourage the girl to join \\"in sexual activity with Taylor and others,\\" according to prosecutors. Taylor's lawyers painted a different picture. They said Taylor was an abused child and that his mother hit him \\"with objects including switches, shoes, or paneling, whatever was around.\\" Asked whether authorities ever got involved, Taylor said, \\"We lived in the country, nobody called CPS.\\" The court filing also challenged Fogle's version of his role in their crimes. \\"Mr. Fogle maintained a controlling influence over Mr. Taylor,\\" the court filing said. Fogle would remind Taylor \\"frequently that he controlled his employment and his home.\\" \\"Mr. Fogle would refer to himself as Mr. Taylor's 'daddy' and there would be discussions of how much Taylor loved 'daddy' and reminding him that 'daddy' was paying for his things,\\" the court document said. \\"Mr. Fogle would even go as far as making Mr. Taylor eat things that were inconsistent with his gluten intolerance.\\" Taylor rejected Fogle's claim that he did not request the pornography, saying Fogle was \\"intimately tied\\" to its creation. \\"It is inconceivable to think that a man who admittedly and regularly sought out sex with minors under the age of 16 did not request the commercial pornography or the home produced videos from Mr. Taylor,\\" the filing said. Fogle pleaded guilty to traveling across state lines to have commercial sex with a minor. Taylor admits that he deserves a harsher punishment than Fogle because he produced the videos. But, his lawyers argued, the prosecution's request of 35 years is too harsh. They said giving Taylor a sentence more than twice as long as Fogle's \\"is not warranted and would create an unreasonable disparity\\" because of Fogle's \\"direct involvement in this crime.\\" Taylor's attorneys also argued that the child pornography produced by Taylor consisted only of secret recordings of nude children. \\"Mr. Taylor placed cameras in places where he was likely to capture the victims without clothing but he was not contacting or directing the victims in the production of the videos in any way,\\" the filing said. \\"Mr. Taylor did not distribute or show the videos he created to individuals other than Mr. Fogle.\\" A sentence of 15 to almost 23 years, which Taylor wants, \\"would avoid a gross disparity between Mr. Taylor and others sentenced for the same type of offenses.\\" The court filing includes a \\"Psychological/Psychosexual Risk Assessment,\\" which noted that Taylor has been married three times and has two children. The report described Taylor's \\"near-fatal\\" suicide attempt by hanging at the Marion County Jail in May. The report also described conditions at the Marion County Jail as \\"horrific\\" for Taylor, and said he was \\"fed food with cockroaches intentionally smashed inside it for days at a time.\\" It said he was \\"handcuffed while other inmates were permitted to physically attack him.\\" In the report, Taylor describes being sexually abused as a child by neighbors. He attended several schools in and around Mooresville. Taylor wanted to go to college, \\"but my mom and Pastor (his step-father, a baptist preacher) had decided the rapture was going to happen in 1989 and that I was better off studying the bible.\\" Taylor was in the Air Force briefly and was honorably discharged, according to the report. He met Fogle while serving as youth market director for the American Heart Association when Fogle was scheduled to speak at elementary schools in the area. Taylor wrote a speech for Fogle that \\"went over well,\\" and they began to develop a closer relationship. They traveled to a Colts-Patriots game at New England and met the announcers. Afterward, they went to a strip club and took a stripper back to their hotel for sex. \\"That began our 12-year run,\\" the report quoted Taylor as saying. Fogle hired Taylor in 2009 to run his foundation. Fogle made jokes and comments about sex with children. They went to Thailand, Korea, Japan and other countries, and while Fogle sought out 18-year-old prostitutes, \\"I'd never seen him have sex with a minor.\\" When Fogle found out about hidden cameras at Taylor's home — to prevent stealing, the report said — the Subway pitchman \\"encouraged Mr. Taylor to keep filming in the house, and eventually to move the cameras in the bathrooms and private areas, in hopes of catching the children naked.\\" Taylor's version of his actions in the psychological report, and particularly his assertion that Fogle was the driving force behind his involvement with child pornography, is a stark contrast to the text messages he sent to an Indianapolis woman before his arrest. Those messages — in which Taylor discussed pornographic images of young girls and bestiality, and shared an image of a woman engaged in a sex act with a dog — prompted the woman to report Taylor to Indiana State Police. In one of the messages, Taylor asked the woman identified in court records as \\"Jane Doe\\" if she wanted to see pictures of young girls. \\"Tell me what you want to see. I got it all,\\" he wrote. When the woman said images Taylor previously sent to her were \\"so hot,\\" he asked if she wanted more. \\"Type? Her with dogs, orgy, s and m, young girls, etc,\\" Taylor wrote. The woman replied \\"young orgy.\\" \\"How young are you ok with?\\" he asked. At that point, the woman said she was interested only in images in which the subjects were of legal age. \\"I wanted to ask lol,\\" Taylor responded. \\"Keep in mind we do travel to Thailand on occasion.\\" Taylor concluded his text with a smiley face emoticon.

Q:This article: In 1859 Burges began work with Ambrose Poynter on the Maison Dieu, Dover, which was completed in 1861. Emulation of the original medieval style can be seen in his renovation of the grotesque animals and in the coats of arms incorporated into his new designs. Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple. The listed status of the Maison Dieu was reclassified as Grade I in 2017 and Dover District Council, the building's owner, is seeking grant funding to enable a restoration, focussing on Burges's work.In 1859–60, Burges took over the restoration of Waltham Abbey from Poynter, working with Poynter's son Edward Poynter and with furniture makers Harland and Fisher. He commissioned Edward Burne-Jones of James Powell & Sons to make three stained-glass windows for the east end, representing the Tree of Jesse. The Abbey is a demonstration of Burges's skills as a restorer, with \\"a profound sensitivity towards medieval architecture.\\" Mordaunt Crook wrote of Burges's interior that, \\"it meets the Middle Ages as an equal.\\" In 1861–2, Burges was commissioned by Charles Edward Lefroy, secretary to the Speaker of the House of Commons, to build All Saints Church, Fleet, as a memorial to Lefroy's wife.

Hamilton argued that the natural faculties of blacks were as good as those of free whites, and he warned that the British would arm the slaves if the patriots did not. In his 21st-century biography, Chernow cites this incident as evidence that Hamilton and Laurens saw the Revolution and the struggle against slavery as inseparable. Hamilton attacked his political opponents as demanding freedom for themselves and refusing to allow it to blacks. In January 1785, Hamilton attended the second meeting of the New York Manumission Society (NYMS). John Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president. Chernow notes how the membership soon included many of Hamilton's friends and associates. Hamilton was a member of the committee of the society that petitioned the legislature to end the slave trade, and that succeeded in passing legislation banning the export of slaves from New York. In the same period, Hamilton felt bound by the rule of law of the time and his law practice facilitated the return of a fugitive slave to Henry Laurens of South Carolina. He opposed the compromise at the 1787 Constitutional Convention by which the federal government could not abolish the slave trade for 20 years, and was disappointed when he lost that argument. Hamilton never supported forced emigration for freed slaves. Horton has argued from this that he would be comfortable with a multiracial society, and that this distinguished him from his contemporaries. In international affairs, he supported Toussaint L'Ouverture's black government in Haiti after the revolt that overthrew French control, as he had supported aid to the slaveowners in 1791--both measures hurt France. Scant evidence has been interpreted by a few to indicate Hamilton may have owned household slaves, as did many wealthy New Yorkers (the evidence for this is indirect; McDonald interprets it as referring to paid employees).

Given the question: The answer to the question: What was the full name of the person who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora? is inside the article: Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in Pochinok, a small Jewish community 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Smolensk, former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic..., can you guess it ? The answer is:","completion":"Ossip Zadkine.

At the start of a game of checkers, each player starts with how many pieces????","completion":"At the start of a game of checkers, also known as draughts, each player starts with 12 pieces. The game is typically played on an 8x8 square board with a total of 64 squares. The board is usually designed with alternating light and dark squares. Though traditional checkers boards have black and white or black and red squares, other designs and color combinations can be used as well. The board is set up such that there are 32 dark squares, which are the only squares where the pieces can be placed during play. Playing pieces in checkers are often flat and round, sometimes referred to as \\"men.\\" The men are placed on the board at the beginning of the game, with each player's pieces occupying the first three rows of dark squares closest to them. The board is positioned with a dark square at the bottom left corner for each player. These 12 pieces are then distributed across these initial three rows, such that the entire row is filled with pieces, leaving only the middle two rows of the board empty at the start of the game. Once the game begins, the objective of checkers is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them in a way that they cannot legally move anymore. The players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward on the dark squares, one square at a time. When a player's piece reaches the opponent's edge of the board, it is \\"kinged\\" and gains the ability to move both forwards and backwards diagonally. Capturing an opponent's piece is achieved by jumping over it diagonally to the adjacent dark square behind it, assuming that square is empty. If multiple captures are possible in a single move, the player is required to make the move that results in the most captures. Players are obliged to make a capture if a legal capture move is available. Different checkers variants have evolved over time, including English draughts, Russian draughts, and Spanish draughts, to name a few. Some of these variants are played on larger boards (such as 10x10 or 12x12) and may have a greater number of initial pieces per player. Nevertheless, traditional 8x8 checkers is perhaps the most widely known and played version, with each player starting with 12 pieces."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Question: How many championships were won by the team Chamakh made his debut on 12 February 2003 in a friendly match against? Passage:Chamakh is a Moroccan international at the senior level. Prior to representing Morocco, he played for the under-19 team of France and made his debut on 12 February 2003 in a friendly match against the Czech Republic. That was his only appearance with the team. Chamakh was then selected within the French squad for the 2003 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, but declined the offer after being called up by Moroccan national team coach Badou Zaki for the team's 2004 African Cup of Nations qualification matches against Sierra Leone and Gabon. On 7 June 2003, he made his debut with the team in the match against Sierra Leone. On 10 September 2003, Chamakh scored both goals, which included his first international goal, in a 2–0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago. He participated in the rest of the qualification matches and was later named to participate in the tournament. Chamakh scored two goals in the competition; one against Benin in the group stage and another in the quarter-finals against Algeria. Morocco beat Mali in the semi-finals to reach the final where they faced Tunisia. In the match, Chamakh played the entire contest as Morocco were defeated 2–1 at the Stade 7 Novembre in Tunis.

Czech Republic national under-19 football team Output:","completion":"Firstly, understand the task at hand. You are given a question, a passage and four options. The question asks: \\"How many championships were won by the team Chamakh made his debut on 12 February 2003 in a friendly match against?\\" In this case, start by reading the passage provided attentively. Focus on the main points of the text. The passage mentions Chamakh, a Moroccan international player who started his career with the French under-19 team. He made his debut against the Czech Republic, but later he chose to play for Morocco. The passage also provides detailed information about Chamakh's games and goals, but doesn't provide data about championships won by the team he made his debut against. To answer the question, we have to seek additional information on the team Chamakh made his debut against - so we need more data on the Czech Republic national under-19 football team. Let's use a step wise approach to solve this task: 1. Understand the question and task at hand. 2. Read the passage thoroughly. 3. Read the terms provided in the four options and relate them with the context in the passage. 4. Identify the key team relevant to the question - in this case, the Czech Republic national under-19 football team. 5. Conduct a search or use the linked information to find out about championships won by the Czech Republic national under-19 football team. 6. After collating the data, finalize the answer, indicating your choice as 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd' according to where the answer is located. The output cannot be determined without the further information mentioned in step 5. Since the task asks us to rely on further information not provided in the prompt, we should search for that info and choose the best response based on what we find. In this case, we'd probably end up choosing 'a' (Czech Republic national under-19 football team) or 'd' (Czech Republic national under-19 football team), since those are both links to the relevant team."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"A man who set up a petition for all children to have the meningitis B vaccine has said he is overwhelmed by the response after more than 640,000 people signed it.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: A Staggering 640,000 Signatures Make the Case for Universal Meningitis B Vaccine for Children Clearer than Ever In an age where modern medicine constantly seeks to improve the quality of life and safeguard humanity's health, the power of passionate advocacy cannot be underestimated. This point is highlighted by the recent response to a petition created by a man dedicated to making the meningitis B vaccine universally available to children. The sheer magnitude of the reaction—with more than 640,000 signatures gathered—signals a strong and growing demand for this change. Meningitis B is a highly infectious disease caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. It predominantly affects children under the age of five, with the youngest being the most vulnerable. The disease can induce a range of symptoms including fever, vomiting, seizures, and skin rash. Unfortunately, it can also cause long-term complications such as brain damage, hearing loss, and even death. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 50,000 people die from meningitis annually, with infants and young children accounting for the majority of those fatalities. The petition, aimed at providing universal access to the meningitis B vaccine for all children, has been propelled by a man who is well aware of the consequences of the disease. His powerful testimony, coupled with the staggering statistics, has managed to draw widespread attention to this critical issue. The overwhelming response of support—640,000 signatures and counting—demonstrates the significant need to reassess the existing vaccination policies. Currently, the meningitis B vaccine is available as part of a routine immunization program in several countries, but not all children have equal access. In the United Kingdom, for example, the vaccine is only offered to babies at two and four months of age, followed by a booster at 12 months. The petition argues that this approach leaves some children, particularly older ones, without adequate protection against the potentially devastating disease. The tremendous support for the petition sends a clear message to health authorities and policymakers, urging them to reconsider the scope of their vaccination campaigns. To satisfy this demand, it would be essential for governments to allocate additional resources and funding to make the meningitis B vaccine available and accessible to all children. This would not only help achieve widespread immunity against this life-threatening illness but also promote the general health and wellbeing of young populations. Furthermore, the petition underscores the need for greater awareness and education regarding meningitis and its impact on children's lives. By informing parents, caregivers, and communities about the risks associated with the disease, as well as the availability and importance of immunization, people can become better equipped to protect their loved ones. In conclusion, the overwhelming response to the meningitis B vaccine petition serves as a watershed moment, causing both the public and officials alike to take notice of this critical health issue. With 640,000 signatures and counting, the message is powerful and unambiguous: Unrestricted access to the meningitis B vaccine for all children could save numerous lives, prevent long-term complications, and ultimately contribute to a healthier, safer, and more secure future for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the current sub-groups of Slovenes? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The current sub-groups of Slovenes primarily consist of several regional and linguistic communities that each maintain their unique cultural characteristics and traditions. These sub-groups include: 1. Prekmurians: The Prekmurians live in Prekmurje, an area located in the northeastern part of Slovenia, bordered by Hungary to the east, Austria to the north, and Croatia to the south. They speak the Prekmurje Slovene dialect and have a rich history and unique customs, music, and cuisine. 2. Hungarian Slovenes: Also known as Slovenes of Hungary, they live in the Raba Valley region of western Hungary, with smaller communities in the Vasi County and the city of Budapest. They speak the Porabje Slovene dialect, which is closely related to Prekmurje Slovene. Hungarian Slovenes are a recognized national minority in Hungary and have their own institutions, newspapers, and schools to maintain their language and culture. 3. Carinthian Slovenes: The Carinthian Slovenes live in the Austrian region of Carinthia, close to the border with Slovenia. They are an officially recognized linguistic minority in Austria. The Carinthian Slovenes speak the Carinthian dialect of Slovene, and they have established their own cultural organizations, schools, and media to preserve their language and customs. 4. Venetian Slovenes: Also known as Italian Slovenes, this sub-group primarily resides in the northeastern Italian regions of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Veneto, close to the Slovenian border. The Venetian Slovenes speak several dialects of the Littoral Slovene, and they enjoy certain special rights to the use of the Slovene language in Italy's public administration, schooling, and media. 5. Resians: The Resians are a small, isolated ethnic Slovene community living in the Resia Valley, located in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of Italy. The Resians speak a unique dialect called Resian, which is highly divergent from other Slovene dialects. They have maintained their own cultural profile and traditions, including performing the well-known Resian dance, called Purga, in their regional costumes. It is worth mentioning that the two extinct sub-groups of Slovenes, the Carantanians and Somogy Slovenes, have left a significant cultural and historical impact on the Slovene people in their respective regions. While they no longer exist as separate entities, their influence can still be observed in the cultural heritage of modern Slovene sub-groups in those areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do I express that I care?\\" Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choices: +no. +yes.","completion":"No, these questions are not the same. The first question addresses the incorrect usage of the phrase \\"mine as well\\" instead of \\"might as well.\\" This error can occur due to a couple of reasons: 1. Phonetics: In speech, \\"might as well\\" may become slurred or shortened, and sound like \\"mine as well.\\" It is not uncommon for it to be misheard and then further spread through general conversations, ultimately leading to a misunderstanding of the correct phrase. 2. Colloquialisms: Phrases often change with time, and people sometimes adapt or modify them to fit their local language or cultural usage, which is another possible reason for the misinterpretation. The correct expression is \\"might as well,\\" typically used to express a sense of passive resignation or a lack of strong preference for a particular decision or action. The second question is about being perceived as nonchalant and having an \\"oh well\\" attitude. The person asking this question is seeking advice on how to express their genuine care and concern towards a particular situation or person without coming across as indifferent or uncaring. Some suggestions to express that you genuinely care are: 1. Active Listening: Engage genuinely when someone is speaking to you. Show interest by asking questions, making eye contact, and offering appropriate responses. 2. Body Language: Express your empathy and concern through non-verbal cues like nodding, smiling, or offering a comforting touch when appropriate. 3. Verbal Reassurances: Use phrases like \\"I understand,\\" \\"I'm here for you,\\" and \\"I care about what you're going through\\" to convey your sincerity and support. 4. Empathy: Put yourself in others' shoes and try to understand their feelings and emotions. This will help you to communicate in a more caring and compassionate manner. 5. Offer Help: If possible, provide assistance, guidance, or resources to those around you who might need it. Demonstrating that you are willing to take the time and effort to help can show your genuine care towards others. In conclusion, the two questions are different as they address separate aspects of language and communication. While the first question focuses on the incorrect use of a common phrase, the second addresses personal communication style and how to convey genuine emotions in interactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Alice Hamilton (February 27, 1869 - September 22, 1970) was an American physician, research scientist, and author who is best known as a leading expert in the field of occupational health and a pioneer in the field of industrial toxicology. She was also the first woman appointed to the faculty of Harvard University. Her scientific research focused on the study of occupational illnesses and the dangerous effects of industrial metals and chemical compounds. In addition to her scientific work, Hamilton was a social-welfare reformer, humanitarian, peace activist, and a resident-volunteer at Hull House in Chicago. Hamilton began her long career in public health and workplace safety in 1910, when Illinois governor Charles S. Deneen appointed her as a medical investor to the newly-formed Illinois Commission on Occupational Diseases. Hamilton lead the commission's investigations, which focused on industrial poisons such as lead and other toxins. She also authored the \\"Illinois Survey,\\" the commission's report that documented its findings of industrial processes that exposed workers to lead poisoning and other illnesses. The commission's efforts resulted in the passage of the first workers' compensation laws in Illinois in 1911, in Indiana in 1915, and occupational disease laws in other states. The new laws required employers to take safety precautions to protect workers. By 1916 Hamilton had become America's leading authority on lead poisoning. For the next decade she investigated a range of issues for a variety of state and federal health committees. Hamilton focused her explorations on occupational toxic disorders, examining the effects of substances such as aniline dyes, carbon monoxide, mercury, tetraethyl lead, radium, benzene, carbon disulfide and hydrogen sulfide gases. In 1925, at a Public Health Service conference on the use of lead in gasoline, she testified against the use of lead and warned of the danger it posed to people and the environment. Nevertheless, leaded gasoline was allowed. The EPA in 1988 estimated that over the previous 60 years that 68 million children suffered high toxic exposure to lead from leaded fuels. Her work on the manufacture of white lead and lead oxide, as a special investigator for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is considered a \\"landmark study\\". Relying primarily on \\"shoe leather epidemiology\\" (her process of making personal visits to factories, conducting interviews with workers, and compiling details of diagnosed poisoning cases) and the emerging laboratory science of toxicology, Hamilton pioneered occupational epidemiology and industrial hygiene. She also created the specialized field of industrial medicine in the United States. Her findings were scientifically persuasive and influenced sweeping health reforms that changed laws and general practice to improve the health of workers. During World War I, the US Army tasked her with solving a mysterious ailment striking workers at a munitions plant in New Jersey. She led a team that included George Minot, a Professor at Harvard Medical School. She deduced that the workers were being sickened through contact with the explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT). Her recommendations that workers wear protective clothing that should be removed and washed at the end of each shift solved the problem. Hamilton's best-known research included her studies on carbon monoxide poisoning among American steelworkers, mercury poisoning of hatters, and \\"a debilitating hand condition developed by workers using jackhammers.\\" At the request of the U.S. Department of Labor, she also investigated industries involved in developing high explosives, \\"spastic anemia known as 'dead fingers'\\" among Bedford, Indiana, limestone cutters, and the \\"unusually high incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis\\" among tombstone carvers working in the granite mills of Quincy, Massachusetts, and Barre, Vermont. Hamilton was also a member of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Mortality from Tuberculosis in Dusty Trades, whose efforts \\"laid the groundwork for further studies and eventual widespread reform in the industry.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did she become a medical investigator?","completion":"Yes, Alice Hamilton did become a medical investigator.

Write highlights for this article: Sportswear giant and Olympic sponsor adidas is facing an investigation after revelations that their official merchandise for the London Games is being made by Cambodian garment workers who are paid just £10 a week in basic wages. Adidas is believed to have invested £100 million in the Games and is one of the event's largest sponsors. The firm manufactured the official Team GB outfit designed by Stella McCartney. But the workers at the company's Shen Zhou factory on the outskirts of the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh work up to 10 hours a day, six days a week, the Daily Telegraph reported. Factory line: garment workers at the Shen Zhou factory in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, make Adidas Olympic Games merchandise. They produce the adidas 'fanwear' for the 2012 Olympics that thousands of fans will buy in stores throughout Britain. Workers living in cramped squalid. conditions said they earned 61 (£40) a month for working eight hours a. day, six days a week, plus a 5 allowance for health care. Branding: Team GB track cyclist Laura Trott wears adidas Team GB London 2012 Olympic kit, which is made at a separate factory. They said they could increase their wages to 120 (£78) by adding an extra two hours' work to their day. Adidas told the Mail Online today that workers at the factory earned on average 130 a month and would get a pay rise in September, along with other garment industry workers. A spokeswoman for the campaign group. Labour Behind the Label said that although the minimum wage in Cambodia. was only 66 a month, the amount they considered to be a living wage for. a Cambodian worker with two children was 260. Campaigners said the treatment of the. workers amounted to a breach of an agreement with the London Organising. Committee for the Olympic Games (Locog) that states merchandisers must. pay workers a sustainable living wage. A spokesman for Locog told the Telegraph it was concerned by the allegations and would investigate them. Soun So-phat, a 30-year-old mother of. two, said she sent half of her earnings home to her parents, who look. after her young daughters in their provincial village. She. said she used to earn a living planting rice but the money she earned. was not enough to feed her children, so she left to look for work in the. capital. Now she can feed them, but the money. that's left over is not enough for her to eat properly. 'It is hard. work. I send home 60 per month and I live on 40. I eat three times a. day but it's not good food,' she told The Telegraph. She lives with five other workers in a. single room where they sleep three to a bed on hard, wooden bed frames. They share an attached squat toilet and cook a few feet away. Wet. clothes hang on lines overhead. 'It is difficult but we have to earn money,' she said. Cramped: Soun Sophat lives in one room with five other workers. They share a squat lavatory and cooking facilites. Wet washing hangs overhead. 'It is difficult but we have to earn money,' she says. What price? Young widow Toch Sreynoun, pictured here with her nephew in their rented room, makes merchandise it would take her two weeks' wages to buy. Bitter taste: 22-year-old Sorn Tola (second from right) says that after her last pay rise, rents were put up. Often workers' accommodation is owned by the factories. Toch Srey-noun, 32, who works as a. pattern-cutter making adidas garments, said she had no idea how much. they cost to buy. In an adidas store it was 39.99 – the amount she. earned in two weeks. She sends. more than half her earnings - around 50 a month – to her mother. Her. father and husband have died and she has a 10-year-old son. A spokesman for adidas confirmed that the factory in Phnom Penh produced Olympic merchandise but denied that the workers' pay and conditions were in breach of the organising committee's standards. He added that the Shen Zhou factory does not produce any kit for Olympic officials or indeed any athletes. Poor pay: A man cycles through the area near adidas' Shen Zhou factory in Phnom Penh. Low-wage workers in Cambodia earn on average 900 a year but adidas did not even pay those working at Shen Zhou the country's minimum wage. Dusk dinner: A garment worker employed by the Shen Zhou factory eats noodles on the street after work on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. One worker, Soun So-phat, said her wages feed her children but there wasn't enough left for her to eat well. Over for another day: Garment workers employed by the Shen Zhou factory that makes 2012 Olympic Games merchandise are transported home. 'Adidas is confident we comply with all Locog standards. Workers at the factory earn an average of 130 a month, which is well above the minimum wage,' he said. A Locog spokesman told The Telegraph: 'We understand that the Shen Zhou factory is part of the International Labour Organisation labour rights programme, which means that it is inspected. 'We regularly remind all of our licensees of the importance we place on the sustainable sourcing code they have each signed up to.' Sorn Tola, 22, said that after the. minimum wage was increased from 56 to 61 in October 2010, the rent. jumped from 25 to 40 a month. Most of the housing blocks that garment. workers live in are owned by various factories, so to make up for the. wage increase, most factories simply raised the workers' rent.

Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. and a hint : In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Please answer this question : Which bike shop fixed more bike transmissions? A:","completion":"A: Based on the given information, it seems that Bob's bike repair shop in the hilly area with more precipitation and full of bike trails would likely fix more bike transmissions.

Lyndon Baines Johnson (; August 27, 1908 - January 22, 1973), often referred to by his initials LBJ, was an American politician who served as the 36th President of the United States from 1963 to 1969, assuming the office after having served as the 37th Vice President of the United States from 1961 to 1963. A Democrat from Texas, he also served as a United States Representative and as the Majority Leader in the United States Senate. Johnson is one of only four people who have served in all four federal elected positions. Johnson, whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in Texas, fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty, and was an essential component of the American dream, especially for minorities who endured poor facilities and tight-fisted budgets from local taxes. He made education the top priority of the Great Society agenda, with an emphasis on helping poor children. After the 1964 landslide brought in many new liberal Congressmen, LBJ launched a legislative effort which took the name of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. The bill sought to double federal spending on education from 4 billion to 8 billion.; with considerable facilitating by the White House, it passed the House by a vote of 263 to 153 on March 26 and then it remarkably passed without change in the Senate, by 73 to 8, without going through the usual conference committee. This was an historic accomplishment by the president, with the billion dollar bill passing as introduced just 87 days before. For the first time, large amounts of federal money went to public schools. In practice ESEA meant helping all public school districts, with more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families (which included all the big cities). For the first time private schools (most of them Catholic schools in the inner cities) received services, such as library funding, comprising about 12 percent of the ESEA budget. Though federal funds were involved, they were administered by local officials, and by 1977 it was reported that less than half of the funds were actually applied toward the education of children under the poverty line. Dallek further reports that researchers cited by Hugh Davis Graham soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received. Early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by ESEA reading and math programs, but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes. Johnson's second major education program was the Higher Education Act of 1965, which focused on funding for lower income students, including grants, work-study money, and government loans. Although ESEA solidified Johnson's support among K-12 teachers' unions, neither the Higher Education Act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in Vietnam. In 1967, Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act to create educational television programs to supplement the broadcast networks. In 1965, Johnson also set up the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts, to support academic subjects such as literature, history, and law, and arts such as music, painting, and sculpture (as the WPA once did). Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he pass any other BILL for education during this time frame?","completion":"Yes, during the same time frame, Lyndon B.

It had been previously known as the Erlachhof, a traditional hunting estate and lodge of the Dukes of Württemberg that was destroyed in 1692, during the Nine Years' War. Eberhard Louis commissioned a replacement lodge that was built from 1697 to 1701. Construction was interrupted by the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, fought against France and Bavaria. Württemberg resisted entry into the war until late 1702. Two years later, Eberhard Louis participated in the Battle of Blenheim in August 1704 that was followed by the exile of the Bavarian Elector. The duke used the battle to press claims to Bavarian lands, but he illegally occupied those lands and was further weakened by a French invasion of Württemberg in 1707. As a result of this attack, the ducal residence in the capital, Stuttgart, was burned and the royal family fled to Switzerland. With the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the occupied Bavarian territory and status of the exiled Elector were restored.Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace began in May 1704 with the laying of the Alter Hauptbau's cornerstone by Eberhard Louis. The year before, he sent Philipp Joseph Jenisch to study architecture abroad. Eberhard Louis made Jenisch director of construction upon his return the next year, but he only managed to finish the Alter Hauptbau's (Old main building) first floor and some of the southern garden before 1707. The duke spent the winter of 1705–06 at Nymphenburg Palace, residence of the Elector of Bavaria, and was impressed by what he saw there and in architectural publications. Unable to compete with Bavaria militarily or politically, and defiant following the loss of the Stuttgart residence, Eberhard Louis decided to follow the example of Bavaria, Baden-Durlach, and the Rhineland Palatinate.

The first way is to get _ on the specific things you want. There is a limitation to this type of approach (,) though. If you find the lowest price on the best hotel in Honolulu at the height of the season, you will save money, but still have a very expensive vacation. Trying to get exactly what you want will generally be an expensive proposition, in travel and in life. The other approach is to be a true opportunist. This will be difficult for some of you, and entirely unacceptable to others. Nonetheless ,the travelers who get to travel the most, go to the widest variety of places, learn the most and do the most, are the opportunists. This will be true until you are so wealthy that you have no monetary (;)limits. The first time I went to Ecuador, I went there because it was cheap. If it wasn't, I would have had a great time--somewhere else. The trip lasted a month, and cost 1045, which included airfare and even the 130 fee for a guide to take me to the top or glacier covered Mount Chimborazo. I cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost 158. The round-trip flight to Quito from Miami was only 256, because it was a courier (,) flight, which meant I signed for some luggage(car parts), and could only take carry-on luggage. Never did I feel deprived, or bored. I had a great time, eating wherever it was cheap and clean, doing all sorts of inexpensive, but interesting things, and traveling across the country to climb Chimborazo. I also met and fell in love with my wife Ana. Being an opportunist means you'll have just as much variety, and probably almost everything you want--eventually. You just have to stop trying to get exactly what you want exactly when you want it. If the guide that took me up Chimborazo hadn't dropped his price from 200 to 130, I would have spent 2 for a bus and gone hiking on EI Altar, another great Andean mountain.

Starbucks CEO Says Presidential Race Will Test Americans' Morality Starbucks sbux Chief Executive Howard Schultz gave an impassioned plea for civility in the run up to the November presidential election, calling it a critical test of Americans’ morality. Schultz, who is outspoken, progressive, and often controversial on social issues, told an annual meeting of Starbucks shareholders in Seattle on Wednesday that he feels enormous pain at the harsh and coarse tenor of political discourse and growing cynicism among the electorate. “There are moments where I’ve had a hard time recognizing who we are and who we are becoming,” Schultz said. He added: “We are facing a test not only of our character but of our morality as a people.” Though Schultz stopped short of naming names, or saying who he supported, he made it clear that he felt that the tone of the current presidential primary races was unworthy of America. Just this week, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump threatened to reveal embarrassing details about rival Ted Cruz’s wife after a pro-Cruz ad, that was not produced by Cruz’ campaign, displayed racy photos of Trump’s spouse. Schultz has often prompted heckles by wading into political waters. Last year, he launched a quickly aborted campaign to have Starbucks baristas and customers discuss the state of race relations in America. Two years before that, he found himself in the crosshairs of gun rights advocates when he asked that customers refrain from bringing firearms into Starbucks stores, even if local laws allowed it. It’s also not the first time Schultz has bemoaned the discourse during the current election cycle: last month, he called the primaries a “circus.” In 2012, Schultz endorsed President Obama when he was running for his second term. He has yet to announce his support for any candidate in the current race. The executive expressed fear for the future of the American Dream, one he said saw him rise from a boy living in public housing in Brooklyn, N.Y., to the CEO of a global 19.2 billion-a-year coffee chain. “I’ve always viewed the American Dream as a reservoir, and it has constantly been replenished with values and work ethic and the spirit of the American people,” he said. “But sadly our reservoir is running dry, depleted by cynicism, despair, division, exclusion, fear, and, yes, indifference.” Schultz said he rejected the idea that his outspokenness was inappropriate and potentially harmful to business: “It has been accretive to our financial performance, to attracting great people,” he said. In fact, he took advantage of the occasion to poke fun at the “War on Christmas” crowd that had severely criticized Starbucks’ red holiday season coffee cups last year for eschewing winter scenes on them. When Schultz pulled out a red cup at Wednesday’s meeting, the audience began screaming and cheering as he said, “It’s amazing, I pull out a red cup and you know what I’m going to say.” “It’s just a red cup,” he said, noting that the controversy resulted in 8 billion social media impressions for Starbucks. The company went on to report record holiday season quarter results.

She was a curious and adventurous child who loved exploring the world around her. One summer afternoon, Gina's family decided to go on a picnic by the river nearby. Her parents, younger brother and cousin were all excited to enjoy the sunny day together. Gina woke up early that morning feeling particularly famished. As it was very hot outside, the idea of consuming a heavy meal didn't appeal to her, so she opted for a light breakfast instead, planning to eat a more substantial meal during the picnic. Before setting off, Gina's parents were busy packing sandwiches, fruit, and drinks for everyone. Knowing Gina's dislike for fries, her mother decided not to include them, despite her little brother's protests. He loved fries so much that he couldn't imagine a picnic without them. Finally, their bags were packed with food and supplies, and the family was ready to go. Step 1: Family heads out for the picnic The sun was shining brightly, but a gentle breeze kept the air pleasantly cool as Gina's family strolled towards the river. Along the way, Gina's stomach rumbled, reminding her of the light breakfast she had eaten that morning. Step 2: Gina gets hungrier As they reached the picturesque spot, Gina was growing hungrier by the minute. The excitement of the day and the physical activity had only served to amplify her appetite. After setting up the picnic blanket, everyone gathered around to enjoy the delicious homemade food. Step 3: Gina eats everything except fries Gina dived into the sandwiches, fruit, and drinks, savoring every bite. She watched as her brother happily consumed his fries, wondering whether she was missing out. However, she still believed that she could go without them. Step 4: Gina's hunger grows stronger Despite having eaten her share of sandwiches and fruit, Gina's hunger persisted. As the family played games and laughed together, she couldn't ignore her growling stomach. Her brother, seeing her uncomfortable expression, offered her some of his precious fries. Step 5: Gina finally gives in and tries the fries With no other food options available and her hunger growing increasingly unbearable, Gina hesitantly took a fry from her brother's outstretched hand, thanking him quietly. Chewing slowly, she expected the familiar distaste to come, but to her amazement, the fry actually tasted good! In fact, it was delicious.

Theresa May is to be hauled before MPs to face questions over what she knew about a damaging letter leaked by her closest aide to undermine Michael Gove. The Home Secretary – who is seen as a Tory leadership contender – will be asked about her role in the ‘unseemly’ public feud with the Education Secretary over how Islamist extremism is tackled in schools. She will be asked about any personal involvement in the release of a letter she wrote to Mr Gove raising concerns about his department’s response to allegations of a plot by Muslim hardliners in Birmingham. Home affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz has called Home Secretary Theresa May to give evidence in Parliament after the deeply damaging row led to the resignation of her close aide, Fiona Cunningham. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home. affairs select committee, said he had written to Mrs May to demand a. full investigation into what had happened. He also revealed that her. special adviser Fiona Cunningham, who was forced to resign on Saturday. night, could be called to give evidence. Labour’s. Yvette Cooper yesterday stepped up pressure on the Government by. accusing the Home Secretary of breaching the ministerial code that sets. out the standards of conduct for those in government. Mr Cameron is said to be ‘deeply frustrated’ over the row between two key Cabinet figures. There. will be concerns in Mrs May’s camp that the questions over her conduct. could harm her leadership ambitions, and she is known to be furious that. she has lost Miss Cunningham – one of her most loyal and trusted. advisers. Last night,. Whitehall sources suggested that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood. may have already concluded that Mrs May did not know about the letter’s. publication because he only told Mr Gove to apologise. The. bitter row started late last Tuesday when comments published in The. Times from an unnamed source – made by Mr Gove during a lunch at the. newspaper – criticised Home Office counter-terrorism chief Charles. Farr’s approach to preventing the spread of extremism. Within. hours of the story appearing, a letter Mrs May previously sent to Mr. Gove questioning his department’s response to the Islamist ‘Trojan. horse’ allegations in Birmingham schools was placed on the Home Office. website by Miss Cunningham. This. was a confidential item of Cabinet correspondence and should not have. been released. A Home Office aide also briefed against Mr Gove to the. BBC on Wednesday morning. Furious that Wednesday’s Queen’s Speech had been overshadowed, David Cameron ordered Sir Jeremy to carry out an inquiry. It. led to Miss Cunningham taking the blame for the letter and resigning on. Saturday night. Mr Gove wrote to apologise to the Prime Minister and Mr. Farr. It is unclear if he will also be forced to apologise to the. Commons. Fired: Home Secretary Theresa May, left, was forced to fire her aide Fiona Cunningham, right, in the aftermath of a vicious row with Michael Gove. Although the. Education Secretary will face a rough ride in the House today when he. publishes 21 reports by Ofsted into the Birmingham schools affair, it is. Mrs May who is facing more questions over her conduct. Mr. Vaz said: ‘I have written to the Home Secretary for a full explanation. of what has happened. The committee will question her about these. matters. There is a strong case to hear from Ms Cunningham herself as to. why she has resigned. David Cameron will reshuffle his Cabinet in the next ten days – and is expected to use the opportunity to promote women. Employment minister Esther McVey, who impressed the Prime Minister with her defence of benefit reforms, is among those being tipped for the top table. The Liverpudlian was a presenter on Children’s BBC and GMTV before becoming an MP. She was also a successful businesswoman, setting up the firm Making It UK, which provides training for small businesses. However, she has a majority of just 2,436 in her constituency of Wirral West. Children’s minister Liz Truss and women’s minister Nicky Morgan could also be promoted. Long-serving Cabinet ministers who may have to make way for a female influx include Andrew Lansley, the Leader of the Commons, who could become Britain’s next European commissioner. Chief Whip Sir George Young and Ken Clarke – the veteran minister without portfolio – may also go. Despite their public row over extremism in schools, both Education Secretary Michael Gove and Home Secretary Theresa May are expected to keep their jobs. ‘This unseemly row obscures the pressing issue of how to combat radicalism in schools. ‘Theresa. May must also ensure that in the future there are no potential. conflicts of interests that may impact on her decision-making.’ Miss. Cooper said Mrs May needed to explain her actions, including whether. she breached the ministerial code, which states that ministers should. not leak confidential letters between members of the Government. She. told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘We’ve seen the Education Secretary. apologise, the special adviser to the Home Secretary resign, but we’ve. heard nothing from the Home Secretary even though it looks clear that. she has breached the ministerial code by writing and then authorising. the publication of this letter. ‘The. Prime Minister is responsible for enforcing the ministerial code. He. needs to act and to make sure that that happens. Theresa May needs to. come out publicly and answer what she did to publish this letter.’ Labour says Miss Cunningham should not receive the substantial severance pay to which she may be entitled after losing her job. Jonathan. Ashworth, Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: ‘If she has been. awarded severance pay this would amount to £37,000, which is the maximum. possible and £10,000 above the average wage. This would be considered. unacceptable in light of the circumstances of her departure.’ Last night Downing Street was unable to say whether any payment had been made. Pupils as young as six were taught to treat Western women as ‘white prostitutes’ by a school at the centre of the ‘Trojan Horse’ Islamist plot. The shocking disclosure comes ahead of two bombshell reports into claims Muslim radicals conspired to infiltrate governing bodies of Birmingham schools. A leaked copy of one report says teachers at Oldknow Academy told school inspectors they were alarmed by the use of terms such as ‘white prostitute’ and ‘hellfire’ in school assemblies, and that non-Muslim teachers were banned from being present. A leaked report speaks of alarm at language and teaching in Oldknow Junior School, Birmingham. A report by the Education Funding Agency says: ‘We were told by teachers that non-Muslim teaching staff are no longer allowed to take Friday assemblies. In separate interviews, staff told us that in Friday assemblies, occasionally words have been used such as “white prostitute” and “hellfire” which they felt were inappropriate for young children.’ Well-placed sources have told The Mail on Sunday that the term ‘white prostitute’ was used to suggest to pupils that Muslim women were moral but non-Muslim women were not. Oldknow Academy, which has around 600 pupils, is said to have been the subject of a gradual takeover by extremists, who allegedly pushed out head teacher, Bhupinder Kondal, because she opposed the ‘Islamisation’ of the school. Head teacher Bhupinder Kondal opposed the 'Islamisation' of Oldknow Junior School. Officially, Mrs Kondal is on sick leave, and she refused to discuss the matter with The Mail on Sunday. She was among four of the school’s six senior managers who have left in recent months. It is also claimed that in one assembly, just before Christmas last year, a senior teacher led ‘an anti-Christian’ chant. He allegedly shouted at the pupils ‘Do we believe in Christmas?’, to which the pupils replied collectively ‘No we don’t.’ The senior teacher is said to have made other ‘anti-Christian comments’ at the same assembly. Officials from education watchdog Ofsted, who have also studied the ‘Trojan Horse’ claims, investigated the ‘anti-Christmas’ chant incident, but found no evidence of it. However, a source said that teachers and pupils at Oldknow have referred to Christians as ‘kaffirs’, a derogatory Arabic term meaning infidels. The source said that as part of the Islamic takeover, urinals from the boy’s toilets were removed, in accordance with Muslim custom which frowns on those who stand up to urinate. More than 95 per cent of Oldknow’s pupils are Muslim. It holds Islamic prayers every Friday, teaches Arabic and organises trips to Mecca. Last week, Oldknow teacher, Samir Rauf defended the school, accusing Ofsted inspectors of ‘having an agenda’. He said he had seen no evidence of an extremist takeover, and denied Christmas had been banned. In February, a senior Oldknow teacher is said to have posted a message on social media urging all Muslims to disown those who gave up their faith. He said: ‘Do not love the one who does not love Allah. If they can leave Allah, they will leave you.’ Only a year ago, an Ofsted inspection of Oldknow found it ‘outstanding’ in all areas, including in promoting multi-racial harmony. It is one of 21 schools being probed for claims extremists tried to influence teaching. Education Secretary Michael Gove is expected to put five schools into special measures when the reports are published tomorrow. He will make a Commons statement as head teachers hold a press conference in Birmingham to speak publicly for the first time. According to a leaked report, teachers at the school lead chants criticising Christmas. The five schools include Oldknow, and secondary schools Park View and Golden Hillock. The running and teaching at all three have been described as ‘inadequate.’ Ofsted inspectors criticise poor teaching at Golden Hillock, and in their report say: ‘Too little is done to keep students safe from the risks associated with extremist views.’ The school, which has just under 900 pupils, is said to have been taken over by extremists with an ‘Islamising agenda.’ Former head teacher Matthew Scarrott reportedly left because he opposed the change. Ofsted say Golden Hillock did not provide adequate sex education and that some female teachers at were spoken to in a way they found ‘intimidating’. The school did little to ‘mitigate against cultural isolation,’ leaving students ‘vulnerable to the risk of marginalisation from wider British society and the associated risks, which could include radicalisation’. However Mohammed Shafique, chairman of governors at Golden Hillock, said he would challenge any move to put the school into special measures: ‘Ofsted’s views are completely unfounded, we do not practise isolationism or segregation. They did not check the reality on the ground. They were listening to comments Michael Gove made.’ At Park View, it is alleged that pupils were told homosexuality is evil, given lists of Christian teachers and told to try to convert them and that staff preach ‘mind-blowing’ anti-Western propaganda in assemblies. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1. Theresa May, the former Home Secretary, faced questioning over her involvement in a public feud with former Education Secretary Michael Gove regarding the handling of Islamist extremism in schools. 2. Keith Vaz, the Home Affairs Committee chairman, asked Theresa May to give evidence in Parliament following a row that led to the resignation of Fiona Cunningham, her close aide. Fiona Cunningham may also be asked to give evidence. 3. The feud originated from allegations of a plot by Muslim hardliners in Birmingham schools. A letter from Theresa May to Michael Gove expressing concern over his department's response to these allegations was leaked by Fiona Cunningham. 4. The incident may negatively affect May's leadership ambitions and has resulted in criticism from Labour’s Yvette Cooper, who accuses the Home Secretary of breaching the ministerial code. 5. David Cameron, said to be frustrated over the row, ordered an inquiry. As a result, Fiona Cunningham took responsibility for the leaked letter and resigned. 6. Meanwhile, investigations on the so-called ‘Trojan Horse’ Islamist plot continue, uncovering evidence of students being taught to view Western women disrespectfully and provocative language used at school assemblies. 7. The Cabinet reshuffle is expected within the next ten days. 8. The 'Trojan Horse' controversy is focused on alleged attempts by Muslim radicals to infiltrate Birmingham school governing bodies and influence teaching. Certain schools are expected to be put into special measures following the publication of reports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Available choices: A). no B). yes","completion":"First, we need to debunk the popular myth that we do not use 100% of our brain. Most of the recent studies in neuroscience indicate that we do use all parts of the brain, just not all at once. Some functions and tasks require more brain activity in certain areas, while others rely on different regions. So, it's important to understand that brain usage is dynamic, and depends on the task or situation at hand. To answer the questions: 1. How can we use 100% of our brain? It's not about using 100% of the brain all at once, but rather optimizing the utilization of our brains through a healthy lifestyle, proper sleep, continuous learning, mental exercises, and stimulating activities that can improve cognitive abilities and neural connections. 2. Is it true that we are not using 100% of our brain? As discussed earlier, this is a misconception. We do use 100% of our brain, but not all at once. Our brain functions are distributed across all its regions, with different regions required for various tasks. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Answer: A). no While both questions are related to the common myth about brain usage, they are not asking the same thing.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What are the last name of the two art critics who wrote about Virgin of Solitude? from the following article ? A number of plates in this group reveal a scepticism towards idolatry of religious images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and processional images, are mocked and denigrated. Plate 67, Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the \\"Virgin of Solitude\\". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, \\"It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations.\\" Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were \\"illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form\\".The published edition of The Disasters of War ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure. The last two plates show a woman wearing a wreath, intended as a personification of Spain, Truth, or the Constitution of 1812—which Ferdinand had rejected in 1814. In plate 79, Murió la Verdad (The Truth has died), she lies dead. In plate 80, Si resucitará? (Will she live again?), she is shown lying on her back with breasts exposed, bathed in a halo of light before a mob of \\"monks and monsters\\".

Options: - success - graduation - failure - anxiety - studying Explain why a human would choose \\"failure\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"failure\\" as the answer to the question above because it is the most applicable option among the given choices. Studying for final exams can be nerve-wracking primarily due to the fear of not performing well, and thus, failing. The fear of failure can create immense pressure on students to succeed, which may lead to feeling overwhelmed, stressed, and anxious. The other options do not fully capture the underlying fear that comes with preparing for final exams. Here's why: - Success: While it might seem counterintuitive, some people do experience the fear of success. However, it's not the primary reason why preparing for final exams is nerve-wracking for most students. Students generally aim for success, so it is less likely to be the cause of the stress in this case. - Graduation: Graduation is a milestone signaling the end of one's academic journey, but it isn't the primary fear in studying for final exams. Although it can be a source of anxiety, it's more about the uncertainty of the future rather than the exam-taking process itself. - Anxiety: Anxiety is an emotional response or a symptom that someone might experience while preparing for exams due to the fear of failure. It's not the root cause of the stress related to taking final exams, but rather a result of it. - Studying: Studying is the act of learning and reviewing materials required for exams. It might be time-consuming and demanding, but it's not the primary cause of stress in this context. The fear of failure during exams is the driving factor behind the nerve-wracking feeling, not the act of studying itself. In conclusion, the fear of failure is the most fitting answer because it directly explains the concern and stress students experience when preparing for their final exams, as they worry about not doing well and the potential negative consequences that may follow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

John liked anything that was placed before him.","completion":"Yes, a linguist would find the following sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically: \\"John liked anything that was placed before him.\\" Let's break down the components of the sentence to understand why it is grammatically correct. 1. Subject: The subject of the sentence is \\"John,\\" a proper noun that refers to a person. A subject is necessary to establish who or what the sentence is about. 2. Verb: The verb in this sentence is \\"liked,\\" which is the simple past tense of the verb \\"to like.\\" This action word conveys that John had a positive feeling towards whatever was placed before him. 3. Object: The object of the sentence is \\"anything,\\" which functions as an indefinite pronoun. The use of \\"anything\\" here signifies any object or item, without specifically identifying it. An object is necessary to receive the action performed by the subject. 4. Dependent Clause: The dependent clause in the sentence is \\"that was placed before him.\\" This clause serves to provide more information about the object \\"anything.\\" A dependent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and verb but does not express a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence. a. The subject in the dependent clause is \\"that,\\" a relative pronoun that refers back to \\"anything.\\" b. The verb in the dependent clause is \\"was placed,\\" which is the passive voice of the verb \\"to place\\" in the simple past tense. The passive voice allows the sentence to focus on the object without specifying who performed the action. c. The prepositional phrase \\"before him\\" functions as an adverbial phrase, describing where the objects were placed. \\"Before\\" is the preposition, and \\"him\\" is the object of the preposition, referring to John. The sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, and all components are grammatically correct and in agreement. Additionally, the dependent clause and the prepositional phrase provide extra information and context without disrupting the grammatical structure. So, from a linguistic perspective, the sentence \\"John liked anything that was placed before him\\" can be considered a valid English sentence grammatically."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For example, if everyone in your community is selling makeup from a particular company, there may not be many potential new customers, no matter how much you believe in the product. A company that has been around for years and has a fair and clear pay plan for distributors is most likely to get you to success. Ask about support and resources the company has for new distributors. Don't be afraid to ask lots of questions before committing to a company. If your recruiter pushes you to join without really answering your questions, it is probably a scam. Your goals can be income-based, sales-based, or even lifestyle-based. Write down your goal and display it somewhere you can see it. Ask yourself every day what you are doing to work towards your goal. Having an objective in mind will motivate you to work towards something. For example, you could aim to generate 2000 a month, make 30 sales, or quit your job to pursue network marketing full time. Start by contacting the person who recruited you. They were convincing enough to get you on board, so take a few tips from their playbook. Ask them what was useful when they were getting started. Get into contact with top sellers and recruiters, if you can. Often, if you have a polite approach and an open mind, they will be more than willing to share advice. Conferences and networking events can be useful for making contact with successful network marketers. Look for resources like books, magazines, podcasts, and videos on how to be successful in network marketing. Be sure to return the favor once you are successful and share your tips with people getting started! Who would most benefit from buying your product? Knowing who you are selling to, what their needs are, and how to reach them is a key to success in network marketing. If you can, avoid relying on friends or family to make the majority of your sales. It can put a strain on your relationship if you ask your loved ones to buy your product and they don't. For example, you may sell clothes that are comfortable and practical for stay-at-home moms, or maybe you sell skincare products for young professionals. Think of different ways you can reach out to those groups, like motherhood groups on social media or networking events in your city. It can take time to see your hard work pay off. Many people get discouraged and give up when they don't reach their goals right away. However, it takes time to build a successful business. Persistence can pay off! If you have a day job, hold off on quitting until you have a reliable stream of income from sales and recruiting. Summary:","completion":"To succeed in network marketing, choose a unique and reputable company, set clear goals, learn from experienced marketers, target the right audience, and stay persistent while building a strong customer base outside of friends and family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read this: Whitehead and Russell had thought originally that Principia Mathematica would take a year to complete; it ended up taking them ten years. To add insult to injury, when it came time for publication, the three-volume work was so massive (more than 2,000 pages) and its audience so narrow (professional mathematicians) that it was initially published at a loss of 600 pounds, 300 of which was paid by Cambridge University Press, 200 by the Royal Society of London, and 50 apiece by Whitehead and Russell themselves. Despite the initial loss, today there is likely no major academic library in the world which does not hold a copy of Principia Mathematica. Why was there a funding burst for the publishing of Princpia Mathematica? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Ok kiddo, imagine two friends, Whitehead and Russell, who decided to create a super-big math book called Principia Mathematica. They thought they could finish it in just one year, like kindergarten to 1st grade. But guess what? It took them as long as kindergarten to 5th grade! When it was time to make copies of the book, they realized it had over 2,000 pages - that's a lot! But not many people wanted to read it, only really smart math teachers. So, it cost a lot of money to make the book, and they didn't earn it back at first. Now, here's the thing: different groups like a school (Cambridge University Press) and a club of smart people (Royal Society of London) gave some of their money to help print the book. Whitehead and Russell put in their own money too. Even though it was expensive at the beginning, today almost all big schools have a copy of the book in their library!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: You have a job, and it's a good one at that. But something is missing. You aren't really challenged anymore. You've been doing the same thing too long. Your company isn't likely to be promoting anyone soon because it has just gone through a major downsizing, merger or takeover. You have two choices: Quit and start over somewhere else, assuming there is somewhere else to go; or look closer to home, right in your current company, to see what other ways your talents can be put to use. Getting out of your career rut requires a mental tow truck. Rev up your brain and consider these points:. 1. Adjust your pace. If you told a 500-meter sprinter who was 250 meters into the race that he was now going to be running a mile, what's the first thing he'd do? Of course, he would change his tempo. He'd stride differently, pace himself differently. The first thing any sensible employee does in a downsized company is to do the same. Realize the path between promotions may now be longer. The rules have changed in mid-race. Tear out your hair and curse the gods if you think it'll help, but the worst thing you can do is make believe it didn't happen. 2. Analyze your competition. More than ever, it's important to know whom you're up against for those few remaining slots. What are the other people doing? What are they overlooking? Is the next promotion slated to go to somebody outside the company to bring in \\"fresh blood\\" and \\"new perspectives\\"? Analyze yourself, too. How marketable are you in the outside world? Get to know your value and your options. 3. Look for sideways growth. If you can't grow going up, can you build your credentials and experience through lateral moves that would teach you new skills? If you're dead-ended in programming, explore the prospects in marketing. There's never been a company yet that didn't need more sales. Give yourself an alternative route. It's a great way to improve your promotion odds long term. 4. Study the corporate culture. Does the company favor a certain way of doing things? Is there a corporate style? When you study the way the winners do it and compare that to the way you do it, you may not like what you see, but you'd better see it. 5. Take a look at your personal risk factor. Sure, there are ways to move up faster, but before you leap, look at the risks involved. If your advancement opportunities are fewer, you may have to find ways to stand out from the rest of the pack. You may fall flat on your face trying, but are you willing to take the chance? Do you have any bold new ideas to propose? Will you take on projects that really stretch your abilities? You can get yourself noticed, and you may get ahead in the process, but your risk of failure increases, too. I'm for trying. Go the extra mile. It's never crowded. You'll fail some of the time. If you don't, you're not trying hard enough. If you want to be the leader of the pack, you have to be willing to stick your neck out in front of the others. Sometimes it's risky not to take risks. 6. Draw up your plan. Add up all the factors: pace, competition, long-term growth options, risk and the hard facts about advancement. Then put down your plan, in writing. 7. Measure your results. If you can, share your plan with your boss, and then measure your own progress on a fixed schedule. If you still don't seem to be going places, it's time to tune up the résumé and look around for a new track to run on. It's been said that the hardest part of climbing to the top of the ladder is getting through the crowd at the bottom. I would add that the first step is the hardest one to take.

After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money.

His wedding ring falls off his finger. Louise becomes concerned when Scott points out that she no longer needs to stand on tiptoe to kiss him. Finally, there is x-ray proof that Scott is getting smaller. His doctor refers him to the prominent laboratory, the California Medical Research Institute, and after nearly three weeks of sophisticated tests, Scott and his team of new doctors learn that the mist to which he was exposed was radioactive. This, combined with an accidental exposure to a large amount of common insecticide four months later, has set off a chain reaction that has rearranged Scott's molecular structure, causing his cells to shrink. Scott continues to shrink proportionately. His story hits the headlines, and he becomes a national curiosity. He can no longer drive a car and has to give up his job working for his brother, Charlie (Paul Langton), who encourages him to make some money off his story by selling it to the national press. He begins keeping a journal, to be published as a record of his experiences. As things continue, Scott feels humiliated and expresses his shame by lashing out at Louise, who is reduced to...

GNU is composed wholly of free software, most of which is licensed under the GNU Project's own GPL. \\"GNU\\" is a recursive acronym for \\"\\"GNU's Not Unix!\\"\\", chosen because GNU's design is Unix-like, but differs from Unix by being free software and containing no Unix code. The GNU project includes an operating system kernel, GNU HURD, which was the original focus of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). However, non-GNU kernels, most famously Linux, can also be used with GNU software; as the Hurd kernel is not yet production-ready, this is how the GNU system is usually used. The combination of GNU software and the Linux kernel is commonly known as Linux (or less frequently GNU/Linux; see GNU/Linux naming controversy). Richard Stallman, the founder of the project, views GNU as a \\"technical means to a social end\\". Relatedly Lawrence Lessig states in his introduction to the second edition of Stallman's book \\"Free Software, Free Society\\" that in it Stallman has written about \\"the social aspects of software and how Free Software can create community and social justice.\\" Development of the GNU operating system was initiated by Richard Stallman while he worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. It was called the GNU Project, and was publicly announced on September 27, 1983, on the net.unix-wizards and net.usoft newsgroups by Richard Stallman. Software development began on January 5, 1984, when Stallman quit his job at the Lab so that they could not claim ownership or interfere with distributing GNU components as free software. Richard Stallman chose the name by using various plays on words, including the song \\"The Gnu\\". Answer this series of questions: 1. What is GNU? 2. What does Linux have to do with it? 3.

Article: When the U.S. entered World War II on December 8, 1941, many Montanans already had enlisted in the military to escape the poor national economy of the previous decade. Another 40,000-plus Montanans entered the armed forces in the first year following the declaration of war, and over 57,000 joined up before the war ended. These numbers constituted about 10 percent of the state's total population, and Montana again contributed one of the highest numbers of soldiers per capita of any state. Many Native Americans were among those who served, including soldiers from the Crow Nation who became Code Talkers. At least 1500 Montanans died in the war. Montana also was the training ground for the First Special Service Force or \\"Devil's Brigade,\\" a joint U.S-Canadian commando-style force that trained at Fort William Henry Harrison for experience in mountainous and winter conditions before deployment. Air bases were built in Great Falls, Lewistown, Cut Bank and Glasgow, some of which were used as staging areas to prepare planes to be sent to allied forces in the Soviet Union. During the war, about 30 Japanese balloon bombs were documented to have landed in Montana, though no casualties nor major forest fires were attributed to them.

Options: (A). Yes. (B). It's impossible to say. (C). No. The answer is:","completion":"(C). No. The given information states that William Thomas Harris III, an American writer born on April 11, 1940, is renowned for his series of suspense novels featuring his most notorious character, Hannibal Lecter. Hence, it would not be correct to infer that he is best known for a series of non-suspense novels about Hannibal Lecter. Therefore, the correct answer has to be option (C). No. Harris' novels about Hannibal Lecter, one of the most chilling and memorable characters in modern fiction, are known for creating a tense atmosphere of suspense and psychological horror. This ongoing mixture of fear and anticipation makes his novels a significant contribution to the suspense genre. His creation of Hannibal Lecter, a cultured, intelligent, yet terrifyingly cannibalistic character, offers a chilling exploration of the human psyche. The novels include \\"Red Dragon,\\" \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" \\"Hannibal,\\" and \\"Hannibal Rising,\\" all of which have been transformed into successful films. The most notable is \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" which was transformative in cinema and became only the third film in Academy Award history to sweep the Oscars in major categories. The film's success illustrates not only the appeal of Harris' suspenseful writing but also how effectively his narrative and characters translate to the silver screen. Despite the diverse array of themes and styles in William Harris' body of work, the common thread is the exploration of suspense and the darker aspects of human nature. His successful blend of high-stakes drama, character development, and psychological insight has brought him critical acclaim and made him a prominent figure in contemporary American Literature. His novels, featuring the notorious character Hannibal Lecter, showcase his unique ability to craft suspenseful narratives, making the inference that he is best known for non-suspense novels incorrect."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After the 1917 February Revolution that resulted in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, the Ossetians set up a National Council of Ossetians which convened in Java in June 1917 and advocated the creation of organs of self-rule in Ossetian-inhabited areas on the both sides of the Caucasus. The Council was internally divided along the ideological lines and soon became dominated by the Bolsheviks who called for the unification of North and South Ossetias and the incorporation of South Ossetia into Soviet Russia. Already in February 1918, there were numerous outbreaks of disobedience among the Ossetian peasants who refused to pay taxes to the Tiflis-based Transcaucasian government. On March 15, 1918, the Ossetian peasants rose in rebellion and managed to hold off an offensive by a Georgian People's Guard punitive detachment commanded by an ethnic Ossetian officer, Kosta Kaziev. The fighting culminated in the town of Tskhinvali which was occupied by the rebels on March 19, 1918. The Georgian People's Guard regained the control of Tskhinvali on March 22. The uprising was finally suppressed and harsh repressive measures established in the region, generating resentment against the Mensheviks, being now equated, in the eyes of the Ossetians, with Georgians. This also opened the way for strong pro-Bolshevik sentiments among the Ossetians.

What is the last name of the person that White sends to the recommissioned Tiger Shark? Answer the above question based on the context below: Lieutenant Commander Ken White orders the submarine Tiger Shark to dive to evade an aerial and surface attack. Crewman Boyer begs him to wait for the captain, Commander Josh Rice, still topside, but White refuses, and Rice (his good friend) and the quartermaster are lost. When they resurface shortly afterward, they discover that the war is over. No one other than Boyer, not even the captain's widow and father, blames him. White marries Carol and remains in the Navy after the war. Everything is fine, until one day he is assigned to show a reporter around who is doing a story about the mothballed Navy. By chance, the submarine that catches the journalist's attention is the Tiger Shark. The newsman remembers the tragic story of the last day of the war and mentions that the officer who ordered the dive \\"must feel like a heel\\", and White's feelings of guilt resurface, straining his marriage. Then Boyer is assigned to his unit. When Boyer sees White, he immediately requests a transfer. As it happens, the Tiger Shark is being recommissioned, so White sends him there. A fire breaks out on the submarine, trapping a man in a compartment. Boyer wants to charge in to his rescue, but White makes him go \\"by the book\\" and put on a protective suit first, fueling Boyer's hatred. White is about to resign from the Navy to escape the ghosts of his past, but changes his mind at the last moment. As a result, Carol decides to leave him. The North Koreans invade South Korea the same day, starting the Korean War. White is given command of the Tiger Shark. He sets sail from the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for the war as soon as the submarine is ready. Boyer is a disgruntled member of the crew.

Question: Question: Jane bought a small dog half way through her trip while driving back home to Toronto from Mexico. Where might she have bought the dog? Choices: - canada - illinois - basket - ball stopped - person's house The rationale to choose \\"illinois\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The appropriate answer is \\"Illinois\\" because it is a geographical location that could reasonably be situated along Jane's trip from Mexico to Toronto. To understand this rationale, let's break it down. The question states that Jane bought a small dog while driving from Mexico to Toronto, which means she likely purchased the dog somewhere in between these two locations. Among the choices provided, only two are geographical locations: Canada and Illinois. Canada could be an answer if she was already close to Toronto, but the question specifically states that she bought the dog halfway through her journey, which implies a location closer to the middle of her route. Given this context, Illinois becomes the more reasonable choice. The other choices are as follows: - Basket: This is an object and does not match the criteria of a geographical location where Jane could have bought the dog. - Ball stopped: Again, this choice is not a location and does not provide a plausible place for Jane to purchase the dog. - Person's house: While Jane could have potentially bought the dog from a person's house, this answer is not specific enough to identify a geographical location on her trip. Considering these points, \\"Illinois\\" is the most reasonable answer, as it is a location that can be found between Mexico and Toronto, and it could be situated halfway through her journey home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the first name of the person who discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports ? Answer the above question based on the context below: The MAUD Committee reports urged the co-operation with the United States should be continued in the research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed.

Poverty, hard work, and even the fact that Father March was away with the Union armies could not down the spirits of Meg, Jo, Amy, and Marmee, as the March girls called their mother. The March sisters tried to be good but had their share of faults. Pretty Meg was often displeased with the schoolchildren she taught; boyish Jo was easy to become angry; golden-haired schoolgirl Amy liked to show up; but Beth, who kept the house, was loving and gentle always. The happy days passed and darkness came when a telegram arrived for Mrs. March. \\"Your husband is very ill,\\" it said, \\"come at once.\\" The girl tried to be brave when their mother left for the front. They waited and prayed. Little Beth got scarlet fever when she was taking care of the sick neighbor. She became very ill but began to recover by the time Marmee was back. When Father came home from the front and at that joyful Christmas dinner they were once more all together. Three years later the March girls had grown into young womanhood. Meg became Mrs. Brooke, and after a few family troubles got used to her new state happily. Jo had found pleasure in her literary efforts. Amy had grown into a young lady with a talent for design and an even greater one for society. But Beth had never fully regained her health, and her family watched her with love and anxiety. Amy was asked to go and stay in Europe with a relative of the Marches. Jo went to New York and became successful in her writing and had the satisfaction of seeing her work published there. But at home the bitterest blow was yet to fall. Beth had known for some time that she couldn't live much longer to be with the family and in the spring time she died. News came from Europe that Amy and Laurie, the grandson of a wealthy neighbor, had planned to be married soon.

Summarize this article in one sentence. properly. Your piercer should give you specific instruction for how to clean your new piercing, including suggesting what products to use for cleaning. Different piercings have somewhat different cleaning requirements, so get clear, written instructions. In general, follow some simple guidelines: Clean skin piercings with warm water and non-scented antibacterial soap, like Dial, or with warm salt water. Don’t use rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide on the new piercing. These are too harsh and can damage or irritate the skin. Avoid using antibiotic creams or ointments. They trap dirt and debris and do not allow the piercing to breathe. Clean your piercing as often as your piercer recommends – not more or less. Under-cleaning can cause buildup of dirt, crust, and dead skin. Over-cleaning can irritate and dry skin out. Both are detrimental to healing. Gently move or twist the jewelry while cleaning it to get the solution inside the piercing and coat the jewelry. This isn’t true for some types of piercings, so always ask your piercer first. Other than proper cleaning techniques, taking care of your piercing can help prevent unnecessary pain and infection. Some guidelines to follow for general piercing care are: Don’t sleep on your new piercing. Your jewelry can rub on your blankets, sheets, or pillows, causing irritation and getting the area dirty. Sleep on your back if you got a navel piercing; if your new piercing is facial, try using an airplane support pillow and aligning your piercing with the middle \\"hole.” Wash your hands before you touch the piercing or surrounding area. Do NOT remove the jewelry before you piercing is healed. Doing so will probably let the piercing close up. If the area is infected, the infection will be trapped in your skin. Try not to let clothes rub directly onto new piercings. Also, do not twist your jewelry unless you’re cleaning it. Stay out of pools, lakes, rivers, hot tubs, and other bodies of water until your piercing heals. About 1 in 5 piercings get infected, usually because of unsterile piercing procedures or improper aftercare. Only ever get pierced by a trained professional and in a reputable, clean piercing studio. Before getting pierced, insist that your piercer show you how and where their equipment is sterilized – they should have an autoclave, and clean all surfaces with bleach and disinfectant. Piercers should only ever pierce you with a new needle out of a sterile package, NEVER a reused needle, and they should always wear fresh, disposable gloves while piercing. A piercing gun is NEVER appropriate. Walk out if you see a piercing gun. Go to a professional to ensure a sterile procedure. Check with your state legislation about what licensing and training someone needs to have in order to pierce you. Do NOT pierce yourself or ask an untrained friend to pierce you. Though having an allergic reaction to jewelry is not the same thing as getting an infection, anything that irritates your new piercing also increases the risk for infection. A severe allergy could also force you to remove your new jewelry. Always get pierced with hypoallergenic jewelry for the best chance for good healing. Request stainless steel, titanium, niobium, or 14- or 18-karat gold. There are lots of places you can get pierced, through different types of tissue in areas that get more or less blood-flow. Thus, healing time varies a lot. Know the specifics of your piercing so you know how long you have to take extra care of it (for a specific piercing not listed, consult your professional piercer): Ear cartilage, nostril, cheek, nipples, navel, and dermals/anchors/surface piercings: 6-12 months Earlobe, eyebrow, septum, lip, labret, beauty mark, and Prince Albert: 6-8 weeks Clitoral hood: 4-6 weeks Tongue: 4 weeks","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of following proper aftercare guidelines, consulting a trained professional, and using hypoallergenic jewelry to prevent infection and ensure successful healing after getting a body piercing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although it is not possible to predict Bailey's exact next actions, we can make some educated guesses about their potential next steps based on common practices in coaching and mentoring. 1. Reassess goals and set new targets: Bailey might want to review Jan's progress and consider whether they have achieved their initial goals. If so, they may collaborate to set new targets, allowing Jan to continue their personal development and growth. 2. Provide feedback and recognition: Bailey may offer constructive feedback and acknowledge Jan's accomplishments, helping to reinforce positive behaviors and boost their confidence. 3. Identify areas for improvement: If there are still aspects where Jan could enhance their performance or skills, Bailey could focus on those areas and develop strategies to address them. This may include additional guidance, resources, or training. 4. Monitor progress and adjust support: Bailey might continue monitoring Jan's progress, adjusting the level of guidance and support as needed. As Jan becomes more independent and capable, Bailey may gradually step back, allowing Jan to take full ownership of their work and achievements. 5. Encourage self-reflection and self-assessment: To promote long-term growth, Bailey could emphasize the importance of self-reflection and self-assessment to Jan, guiding them in evaluating their own performance and identifying areas for future development. 6. Support Jan's networking and professional development: Bailey could introduce Jan to relevant networking opportunities, workshops, or conferences that could help expand their professional network and enhance their skills and knowledge in their field. Ultimately, Bailey's next steps will depend on various factors, including Jan's progress, their goals, and the specific context of their work or collaboration.

In the second quarter, the Bengals continued to struggle as kicker Matt Stover gave Baltimore a 21-yard field goal. Cincinnati would reply as kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 43-yard field goal. However, in the third quarter, the Bengals continued to show their dismal defense as Ravens QB Joe Flacco got a 38-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Bengals tried to rally as CB Johnathan Joseph returned a fumble 65 yards for a touchdown. However, Baltimore's defense stiffened and held on for the win.

Article:","completion":"Title: United.com Glitch Provides Massive Discounts on First-Class Flights Introduction: In an unexpected turn of events, United Airlines' website, United.com, experienced a glitch that had travellers rejoicing earlier this afternoon. The malfunction resulted in massively discounted first-class, round trip flights being offered for a short period of time. Step 1: Describe the glitch and its effects on fares The glitch appeared on United.com this afternoon, offering first-class, round trip flights from London to Newark at the unbelievable price of just US74. This unprecedented discount on premium air travel caught the attention of savvy travellers, who wasted no time in booking these extraordinarily low-priced flights. It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for those who managed to secure a ticket at this exclusive rate. Step 2: Provide the duration of the glitch and its resolution As of 16:00 GMT, United.com seems to have resolved the issue, with the website once again operating as normal. The glitch was only active for a brief window this afternoon, and it is currently unclear just how many lucky individuals were able to take advantage of the deeply discounted fares. Step 3: Discuss possible reasons for the glitch While the exact cause of the glitch remains a mystery, it's not uncommon for airline websites to occasionally experience technical difficulties. Such errors can result in temporary fluctuations in pricing, as was the case with United's first-class fare anomaly this afternoon. United Airlines has not issued a statement on the incident as of yet. Step 4: Address the potential consequences for United Airlines The aftermath of the glitch may present challenges for United Airlines, as they will likely have to determine whether to honour the heavily discounted fares or risk facing backlash from customers who were fortunate enough to book at that price point. Regardless, the incident underscores the importance of proper website maintenance and management, as failure to do so can lead to significant financial repercussions. Conclusion: Today's glitch on United.com provided a bonanza for lucky travellers who were able to snag wildly discounted first-class, round trip flights from London to Newark. Though the error was short-lived, its consequences for United Airlines remain to be seen. One thing is certain: travellers will be keeping a close eye on the airline's website in hopes of catching future deals and glitches alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As the world watched in horror, the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City crumbled to the ground. In the midst of the chaos, one photo captured the human reaction to this tragedy. This article delves into Patrick Witty's iconic photo, which has found a worldwide audience, and his quest to connect with those depicted in it. The Photo and its Impact: Patrick Witty, a talented photojournalist, captured a moment that would become etched in the collective memory of the world. As the South Tower began to crumble, he snapped a photo of people staring up at the scene before them, their faces etched with disbelief, shock, and horror. Since then, the poignant image has been republished dozens of times worldwide, reflecting the shared emotions of the global community. The photo serves as a stark reminder of the enormous loss and pain experienced that day, and its enduring impact is evident in the numerous times it has been shared and discussed. It transcends national boundaries, illustrating the power of photography to capture our most intense and vulnerable emotions. The Quest to Meet the Subjects: One might assume that given the prominence of the photo and its wide distribution, the identities of its subjects would be known. However, this is not the case. In an effort to connect with the people captured in the image, Witty has posted his photo on social media in hopes of locating more of them. This drive to know their stories and experiences stems from the emotional connection the photojournalist feels with his subjects. Recently, Patrick Witty had the opportunity to meet two of the individuals from his photo, including Benjamin Tabile. The reunion was a powerful and emotional experience for both the photographer and his subjects, as it provided closure and a sense of connection that had been missing for years. Tabile's story, along with the accounts of others present that fateful day, adds depth and context to the photo, humanizing the subjects and their emotions. Through forming these personal connections, Witty hopes to further understand the impact of his image and the reality behind the faces in it. Conclusion: As Patrick Witty continues his mission to find the remaining subjects of his iconic photo, it is clear that the image's impact has transcended its status as a mere snapshot in time. It serves as a testament to the power of photography to capture our emotions, our vulnerability, and our resilience. The quest to meet the individuals in the photo not only validates the photographer’s work but also reflects our shared need to connect in times of tragedy and the years that follow. By fostering connections between people, Witty's photo has become more than a visual record of that day; it has evolved into an ongoing narrative of the human spirit, one that resonates on a global scale."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

One of the officers, 52 years old, was seriously injured, said Hudon. Niagara police say the officer who was shot has served for 28 years and is assigned to uniform patrol in Welland and Pelham. He was rushed to hospital in critical condition, but the service issued a statement Thursday evening saying he was in stable condition. The officer's name has not been released.

Hudon made her remarks shortly after 6 p.m. at a news conference on Roland Rd. just west of Effingham St. According to police sources, a Niagara Regional Police officer shot another officer in an argument during a collision reconstruction unit investigation Thursday in rural Pelham, Ont. ( Dave Johnson / The Welland Tribune ) She said officers were in the area conducting a follow-up investigation of a Nov. 12 impaired driving collision in the area of Sulphur Spring Dr. and Roland Rd.. “Around noon there was an interaction between two of the officers and one of the officers was struck by a gunshot,” said Hudon. The nature of the altercation between the officers has not been disclosed. Article Continued Below She couldn’t confirm the number of times the officer, identified by multiple police sources as Const. Nathan Parker, was shot. But those sources told The Standard Parker was hit at least five times. The other officer involved in the incident has been identified by multiple police sources as Det. Sgt. Shane Donovan of the traffic collision reconstruction unit. Hudon did not confirm the officers’ names. Parker is reported to be 52-years-old. Hudon did not have an age for the other officer. Niagara Emergency Medical Services paramedics treated Parker at the scene and transported him to an area hospital. Parker was later transferred by Orgne air ambulance to Hamilton General Hospital where he was listed in critical condition. She also asked that anyone who may have video of the shooting to share it with the SIU or upload it to the SIU website. The SIU investigates all incidents of serious injury or death involving police in Ontario. “Understanding what transpired and the relationship between the two officers is part of the investigation. I can only tell you there was an altercation and a firearm was discharged,” Hudon said. Article Continued Below Asked the exact location of the incident, she said it was in the area of Effingham St. and Roland Rd. “It’s very early in the investigation … we’re in the preliminary stages and it will take time to gather all of the details.” No charges have been laid. Niagara OPP officers were blocking the area around the shooting and Hudon said they were holding the scene for the SIU. There was no word on when Effingham, blocked between Sixteen Rd. and Wessel Dr., and Roland, blocked between Sulphur Spring and just west of Effingham, would be reopened. In a release, NRP Chief Bryan MacCulloch said in the spirit of transparency, he asked the OPP to determine if there was any criminal culpability outside of the SIU’s scope. “The days and weeks ahead will be trying ones for the regional police family and the community we serve. I ask for your support for our members and all those involved,” MacCulloch said. In a release earlier in the day, police said because the SIU is involved the service is prohibited from providing further information. Parker has a long and troubled history with the NRP, having faced at least four disciplinary hearings, three of which involved violence. In 2015, Parker was docked 120 hours’ pay after pleading guilty to discreditable conduct and unnecessary use of force against a prisoner under the Police Services Act. In 2012, Parker was docked 60 hours of pay after pleading guilty to discreditable conduct after pursuing his own investigation into a commanding officer who had been cleared of wrongdoing from a previous incident. Parker was found guilty of using unnecessary force in 2011 and docked 90 days’ pay for arresting a cyclist without cause in 2008. And in 2007, Parker lost a week’s pay after he was found guilty in a disciplinary hearing for pepper-spraying a prisoner who was handcuffed and restrained in the back seat of a cruiser in 2005. The impaired driving collision investigation scene the two officers were at involved an incident that happened Nov. 12 at about 10:54 p.m. It was determined a 19-year-old Pelham man was operating a 2016 Ford Focus with two 19-year-old female passengers when he was unable to negotiate a curve and lost control, entered a ditch and struck a tree. The vehicle burst into flames, and the fire was extinguished by the Pelham fire department. The vehicle was destroyed. The man was able to get out of the car, but the two passengers had to be rescued from the burning vehicle by a local resident and a passing motorist. They both sustained serious injuries, with one later being transported to an out-of-region trauma centre for treatment of critical injuries. Mike Zettel, a reporter with The Tribune’s sister paper Niagara This Week, spoke with Donovan Thursday morning near the investigation scene. “He was very friendly and very helpful,” said Zettel. “Often when a reporter gets to a scene like that, the officer you talk to is just there at the roadblock and might not know anything about the incident. But I got lucky. (Donovan) was able to explain what was going on.” The police service’s union, Niagara Region Police Association, has mobilized to provide support to the impacted officers, police staff and their families. Association president Cliff Priest, who is also an NRP officer, said there haven’t been many cases of NRP officers being shot while on duty, but each one is difficult for the entire service.

A Niagara Regional Police constable was in grave condition after being shot in an altercation with a fellow officer who outranked him. The shooting, sources say, followed a “heated argument” and “fist fight” between a constable and a detective sergeant responding to a traffic accident around Roland Rd. and Effingham St. in Pelham, 22 kilometres south of St. Catharines. Wounded Const. Nathan Parker was in hospital fighting for his life Thursday while Det.-Sgt. Shane Donovan was determined to be the subject officer by the province’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU). Sources told the Toronto Sun that Donovan was losing a fight before the shooting. Up to five bullets were allegedly discharged from a police officer’s gun. There have been accidental shootings of police officers by their partners but in his more than 50 years as a Toronto Police officer, newly-named OPP Commissioner Ron Taverner, currently a superintendent, said he can’t recall ever hearing of a case where an officer shot a peer. “It’s very sad and our thoughts are with the Niagara Police today,” he said. The shooting victim, sources say, did not pull a weapon. The SIU confirmed it is investigating an interaction between two Niagara Regional Police Service officers, and one of the cops suffered a gunshot wound. There have been no reports so far of anybody being taken into custody and the SIU is leading the investigation.

Sources told the Toronto Sun Parker has had a troubled past of police act charges and discipline issues. Policing insiders say Parker racked up Police Services Act convictions, including for violence against prisoners, during his career. He was docked 120 hours in 2015 after pleading guilty to discreditable conduct and unnecessary use of force against a prisoner.

At the onset of the siege, probably fewer than 50,000 people were living within the walls, including the refugees from the surrounding area.:32 Turkish commander Dorgano, who was in Constantinople in the pay of the Emperor, was also guarding one of the quarters of the city on the seaward side with the Turks in his pay. These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army's Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, while the rest of the army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally monks. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery pieces, which nonetheless proved ineffective. The rest of the city repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches to melt down into coins to pay the foreign soldiers. The Ottomans had a much larger force.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Snowden filmmaker Laura Poitras: ‘Facebook is a gift to intelligence agencies’ In January 2013, Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Laura Poitras received an e-mail that would eventually change what the world knew about government surveillance. The e-mail came from Edward Snowden, using the alias Citizenfour. That alias is the title of Poitras's latest documentary, an intimate portrait of the eight days she spent in Hong Kong with the former National Security Agency contractor as the first of his revelations made headlines around the world. Citizenfour will open with a limited release in New York, Washington and Los Angeles on Friday. Poitras, who received a Pulitzer Prize for her work with The Washington Post and the Guardian covering the revelations, sat down with the Switch to discuss the film and how technical advances may make it easier for us to keep our online lives private. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Andrea Peterson: One of the things I found very interesting about the film is how intimate of a portrayal of Snowden it is. But as I understand it you were already working on a film about government surveillance in a post-9/11 world, and a lot of that didn't end up making it into the final film. Can you talk about how you made the decision to hone in? Laura Poitras: In 2011, I started doing some filming with several people. I was interested in not only NSA surveillance but also what was happening with journalism and the sort of zeitgeist. So I filmed with Glenn [Greenwald, who worked with Poitras and the Guardian to break the first Snowden stories] -- I said, \\"Who is this guy in Rio, sort of off the grid, but having this sort of influence?\\" I wanted to film where he was and where he worked, so I did that. And then I also started filming [NSA whistleblower] William Binney. This was at the time that [NSA whistleblower] Thomas Drake [was facing] espionage charges, and it looked like he was going to trial. It was the first time named NSA people started coming forward. So I started filming with the NSA -- and with Binney, he was sort of the architect of the surveillance system that is now something turned inwards. I also started filming with Jacob Appelbaum, who does anti-surveillance stuff, trains activists all over the world and works with the Tor Project, etc., as well as with Wikileaks and Julian Assange. I was also interested in talking about how there were these new spaces opening up in journalism, and how with their disclosures they worked with multiple news organizations. It felt like it raised the bar in terms of journalism that was more adversarial to the government. I was deep into filming when I got the first e-mail from Snowden, which was in January of 2013. I had published a short piece on William Binney in the New York Times in summer of 2012, and that was something [Snowden] had seen, so that's probably one of the reasons he knew I was interested in the topic. In terms of how it shifted -- it obviously shifted enormously once I was contacted and drawn into the story in a different way. I became a participant in the narrative. And then after returning from Hong Kong, it was clear that two films had been shot and that the one that was about Snowden was one that I was a participant in. That's the trajectory of it. But it was an obvious choice -- it was obvious once we looked at the footage; it was clear that Hong Kong would be such an important piece of the film that it became the organizing principle around which other things fell into place. A.P.: You actually beat me to my next question. You are a character in the film, you're very key to how everything unfolds. But besides some text interstitials and your reading of e-mails from Snowden, you really don't appear on camera... Was that a conscious choice? L.P.: I consider that I'm sort of the narrator of the film, and it's obvious that it's told in the first person and it's a subjective film. I also come from a filmmaking tradition where I'm using the camera -- it's my lens to express the filmmaking I do. In the same way that a writer uses their language, for me it's the images that tell the story. So it's very hard for me to be in front of the camera and shoot -- and in Hong Kong, there was no other crew. For me, the camera is my tool for documenting things, so I stay mostly behind it. A.P.: There were also some very interesting aspects of the whole story that seemed omitted. For instance, and obviously you weren't personally there to film it, but how he escaped from Hong Kong and spent 40 days in a Moscow airport. Also from what I understand some of the back and forth between yourself and Greenwald and Wikileaks about how things should move forward... Can you talk about how you made decisions about what to include? L.P.: My films have always kind of been about protagonists -- they are the lens through which the film happens. And I also film in a verite style, so I don't tend to do interviews. So things are happening as I can document them with my camera. I actually did try to go to the airport when he was there, but it didn't happen. I would actually very much liked to have shot that. We also considered doing footage about all of the leaks, but ultimately decided we didn't want to chronicle them because there were so many, and we wanted to follow some specific protagonists in the story. It was largely determined by what I was able to film -- and wanted to keep a sort of subjective perspective. A.P.: Going back to the main protagonist, there are numerous points in film and elsewhere in media reports in which Snowden is referenced as someone who doesn't want to be the focus of the story. But this film is very clearly about him and the choices he made, along with those that others involved, including you and Glenn, made with him. He was also very insistent upon revealing himself as the source -- in Greenwald’s book he’s said to have already written a manifesto for that purpose before you met in Hong Kong. And at other points in the film Snowden makes several very specific references to martyrdom, at one point saying he was willing to be crucified? Is there a conflict there? A.P.: A conflict between Snowden not wanting to be the focus of the story, but also very clearly being the focus of the story. L.P.: What had happened when we were corresponding in April was that he said he was not going to try to hide his identity -- that he would come forward, and that he didn't want me protecting him as a source. The rationale he gave me was that he felt that people should know why he had done it and that he didn't want to hide. And then also, I think he knew that there would be a massive leak investigation and he wanted to come forward before that began. He could have done that before we even met, and I think that's what he thought in April, that we wouldn't have a face-to-face. And then I said, well, if you intend to come forward and reveal your identity I want to meet you and understand your motivation -- and I want to film. He responded: I don't want to be a big story; it's not about me. And he also had concerns that if we were to meet and anything were to happen, it might stop the reporting. So I gave arguments that this story, even if he didn't want it to be about him, people will cover him -- the media will write about him. So it really wasn't his choice. I also said that I would make sure that I would back things up to reduce the risk of us being at the same place. That was the context in which we began talking about meeting, which ultimately happened several weeks later. In terms of a contradiction, I don't find it to be much of one. I think he didn't want to be the focus, but he knows he is the focus. He doesn't have control over it. It's not something where you get to say, \\"That's not my wish,\\" because, of course, given what he had done, he was bound to be part of the story. A.P.: Speaking more broadly, do you think there have been diminishing returns on Snowden’s revelations as they have continued to be unveiled, that the more recent news has been less shocking as the public has become somewhat fatigued by reveal after reveal? L.P.: I've been based in Berlin for the past year, so I feel like I don't have the best sense of what's happening here. So I'm not sure if I can gauge it to respond. I do think the risk with anything like this is that it becomes normalized -- and that that's a genuine risk. But I also think that there are shifts that we're seeing. Right now we have this thing going on between tech companies over encryption and the FBI saying it's the end of the world... A.P.: You just preempted another of my questions. L.P.: I think it's clear that there's been a change in public consciousness. Public policy? Maybe not that much. But there's a tech response to this, and I think there are things that we're not seeing that will emerge in the coming months and years. So it's hard to say what effect this is having on the people who build the tools we use to communicate. I think there are things that are not on the surface that are happening. A.P.: Speaking of tech tools -- honestly, one of the issues with tech tools available is that they aren’t particularly user-friendly. I’ve used Tails, Tor, OTR, etc, but I can’t really imagine getting my parents or grandparents to do so on a regular basis. What can your average Internet user do to protect their online privacy? L.P.: I would say to people that actually it's not brain surgery -- if you want to communicate securely you don't have to wait on a change in policies. Encryption works, and people can use it -- and certain people should, like journalists. But I agree that it's a bit of a high bar. And I think what we're going to see is a market for privacy that's going to emerge. I think technology companies will come forward and offer tools that are easier to use. I mean, [e-mail encryption tool] PGP is not easy, but it could be, and I think it will be. A.P.: Do you think there's a bit of conflict between privacy and the fact that technology companies are organizations who also track what people are doing online? Covering cybersecurity, I often think that there are three people who are likely to be watching: governments, cybercriminals and for-profit companies. Who should we be most afraid of? L.P.: I think we should certainly be the most worried about the government -- they clearly have the most power. On technology companies, we should be concerned, but we are consenting to that relationship -- and they don't have the same powers. They can help the government find out who your sources are, but they don't have the power to investigate people. Which isn't to say that you shouldn't be concerned by the amount of data that Google or Facebook has on people. But I do think it's a different situation that government. A.P.: Is there a risk that when private companies are collecting this type of data they're in effect also enabling government surveillance in some forms? L.P.: Sure, don't you think? It totally does. Facebook is a gift to intelligence agencies. People volunteer all their social information. A.P.: You mentioned earlier that you think that there were two films that came out of your footage. Do you think you're ever going to do the other film? L.P.: Yeah, I am, but I think I'm going to take a break. A.P.: I'd like to talk a bit about the Freedom of the Press Foundation -- where there is now a nice little cabal of people who are linked to the Snowden story, including Snowden himself, working on things. What's your next plan there? L.P.: I think we're going to continue to do the sort of crowdsourced funding for journalism tools and pushing for transparency, trying to make that possible. Right now we're putting resources and funding into SecureDrop for other news organizations so they can have a place where whistleblowers can submit documents and tips or information. I think one of the really exciting things about the organization is that we have a technology board who has all sorts of experience in the free software movement who actually know how to determine what are the good forms of encryption and how to handle peer review. Another thing that's going to happen in the wake of Snowden is there are going to be a lot of security products that are snake oil, right? I think that it's really important that the people who are doing free software and peer review can do vetting and ensure that things are backdoored. I think this is a moment where a lot of foundations are thinking, \\"Oh, we need to give money for privacy-related things,\\" and I think there will be a lot of tech things that emerge where the Freedom of the Press Foundation can give guidance on what to trust and what not to trust. A.P.: A lot of the major cybersecurity issues that have come up in recent months have actually involved open source projects that seem to be undersupported in many ways. Are there ways you can think of to provide more oversight than just hope that all of the eyes will catch everything? L.P.: Honestly, I don't have the technological skillset to do that sort of peer review. But I know a lot of people who have devoted many years of their lives to the free software movement, and I do think it should have more support and funding. I know something like TAILS, which I relied on for all of my reporting on this and I know Bart Gellman did, as well, was all developed by people for no money who created a system that made it pretty hard to mess up and not go over encrypted channels. It's an incredibly important service to journalists, and they've done it I believe basically self-funded. I think it's important to look at the people who are developing those tools and how we can support it. I'm totally dependent on things like the Tor Project and TAILS, and they don't have enough funding from foundations and other sources.

One month before the Winter Olympics begin in the Russian resort town of Sochi -- and in the shadow of last month's deadly bombings in Volgograd -- a huge security operation has swung into gear. A special exclusion zone went into force Tuesday under which only Sochi-marked vehicles, emergency or specially accredited intelligence service cars will be allowed into the wider Sochi area. Air traffic and sea access will be restricted, and everyone going into the zone will have to go through heavy security and identity checks. Russia is pouring huge resources into ensuring that the Games, seen as a flagship project of President Vladimir Putin, go off without incident. Two bombings in 24 hours last month in Volgograd, one targeting the city's main train station and the second a trolley bus, raised concerns of a potential threat to the Sochi event. No group has to date claimed responsibility for the attacks, but suspicion has fallen on Chechen separatist groups. A bitter battle for an independent Chechnya, lasting almost two decades, spawned an insurgency that has spilled into neighboring republics in the North Caucasus region, including Dagestan. Chechen warlord Doku Umarov, leader of the Islamist Caucasus Emirate group, last summer called on his followers to do what they can to disrupt the Games. He claims they will be held on the graves of Muslim occupants of Sochi, who he says were driven out by Russian imperial forces in the 19th century.

He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with \\"Conrack\\" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world. Conroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \\"what death would sound like\\". He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden.

Halévy about completing his old tutor's unfinished opera Noé. Although no action was taken at that time, Bizet remained on friendly terms with the Halévy family. Fromental had left two daughters; the elder, Esther, died in 1864, an event which so traumatised Mme. Halévy that she could not tolerate the company of her younger daughter Geneviève, who from the age of 15 lived with other family members. It is unclear when Geneviève and Bizet became emotionally attached, but in October 1867, he informed Galabert: \\"I have met an adorable girl whom I love! In two years she will be my wife!\\" The pair became engaged, although the Halévy family initially disallowed the match. According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch: \\"penniless, left-wing, anti-religious and Bohemian\\", which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from \\"a family bristling with artists and eccentrics\\". By summer 1869, their objections had been overcome, and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869. Ludovic Halévy wrote in his journal: \\"Bizet has spirit and talent. He should succeed\\".As a belated homage to his late father-in-law, Bizet took up the Noé manuscript and completed it. Parts of his moribund Vasco da Gama and Ivan IV were incorporated into the score, but a projected production at the Théâtre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho's company finally went bankrupt, and Noé remained unperformed until 1885. Bizet's marriage was initially happy, but was affected by Geneviève's nervous instability (inherited from both her parents), her difficult relations with her mother and by Mme. Halévy's interference in the couple's affairs. Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with his mother-in-law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her.

Jeff thinks that the new pope should tell everyone the names of these bad people and also show all the papers about them. This way, everyone will know who the bad people are, and we can keep them away from children. Another important change Jeff wants is to change the rules and protocols in the church. The church should not follow the old rules which allow some bad people to escape punishment. Instead, if someone hurts a child, that person should be reported to the police. Police officers are like super heroes who help protect us from bad people, so they should know who these people are too! Jeff Anderson believes that if the new big boss at the church makes these changes, it will mean a safer place for children.

I read this background article the other day: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. I am facing a new situation today: Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library.

But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Who was brought up in the conversation of Mary's holiness?\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, the text does provide detailed information on the development of the doctrine of Mary's sinlessness and how it was perceived by various early Christian theologians and the church. In the passage, it is stated that the doctrine of Mary's sinlessness, as defined by Pius IX, was not explicitly discussed before the 12th century. The text acknowledges that there is no direct or categorical evidence of this dogma in the Scripture. However, it is argued that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teachings of the early Church Fathers. Several epithets such as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" were applied to Mary in the first five centuries. She was often compared to Eve before the fall, as the ancestress of a redeemed people. Furthermore, she was described as \\"the earth before it was accursed\\", implying her sinlessness. St. Augustine (d. 430) was one of the prominent Church Fathers who touched upon the subject of Mary's sinlessness. In his writings, he stated, \\"As regards the mother of God, I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" Although his statement is mainly referring to actual or personal sin, his argument suggests that all individuals are sinners through original depravity. According to St. Augustine, this original depravity can be overcome through God's grace, and he speculates that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin in every aspect (omni ex parte). In summary, although the text doesn't explicitly mention who was brought up in the conversation of Mary's holiness, it does provide an in-depth analysis of how the doctrine of Mary's sinlessness developed over time, the expressions used by early Church Fathers, and the theological perspectives on the concept of original sin and grace. Prominent theologians like St. Augustine contributed to this discussion, emphasizing the potential sinlessness of Mary through God's grace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the drilling fluid that is significantly more expensive than untreated petroleum fuels? Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit. Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene. They are inexpensive and easily available, and were once in common use; disadvantages include flammability and the aromatics they contain, which are a health hazard. Non-aromatic hydrocarbons. As of 2009 these had become the most commonly used drilling fluids; eliminating the...

Recently, delegates from the United Nations Conference have strongly backed continued talks on the global challenge of climate change, emphasizing the need for collective efforts and cooperation to foster a sustainable future. Held annually, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) serves as a platform for delegates and representatives from a diverse range of countries. At the conference, they discuss and devise cutting-edge strategies to mitigate the adverse impacts of global warming and promote climate resilience and adaptation. The unanimous backing of the conference participants proves that climate change talks remain a top priority for nations seeking to balance development and environmental preservation. Nations around the world are grappling with the consequences of climate change, such as extreme weather events, escalating temperatures, rising sea levels, and shifts in ecosystems. These factors affect our infrastructure, natural resources, health and well-being, and food security, necessitating a global response—something that the UN conference aims to address during its sessions. Tackling climate change requires an all-inclusive approach, able to incorporate various aspects, such as clean energy transition, energy efficiency, reforestation, land management, carbon pricing, and financing climate-friendly projects. In addition to these interventions, the delegates at the UN conference advocate for more research and development, outlining techniques in lowering greenhouse gas emissions and building resilience to the harsh consequences of climate change. The implementation of internationally recognized agreements, such as the Paris Agreement and Kyoto Protocol, reflects a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and holding global temperature increases in check. During the UN conference, delegates collaborate on assessing the progress made by nations in meeting their climate commitments and identifying roadblocks to bridge the gap between current efforts and the targets set forth in these agreements. One of the remarkable aspects of the UN conference is that it offers the perfect venue for nations, especially the most vulnerable ones, to voice their struggles and concerns on climate change. With the backing of conference delegates, developing nations receive the moral and financial support needed to put adaptive measures in place that protect their citizens from the dire consequences of a changing climate. In conclusion, delegates from the United Nations Conference have strongly endorsed climate change discussions, recognizing this issue as a global responsibility requiring immediate action. As representatives from around the world continue to engage in climate talks, promoting transparency and accountability remains crucial in achieving meaningful progress. Encouraging technological advancements and adopting sustainable development strategies will guide humanity on a path towards mitigating the harmful effects of global warming and ensuring a resilient future for our planet."},{"prompt":"Q:On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"I hate...

Question: Who has said that the change in law would violate the sanctity of marriage? Movie title: Freeheld Movie plot: The film opens at a meeting of the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County, New Jersey in 2005. Ocean County resident and New Jersey police officer Lieutenant Laurel Hester, a 23-year veteran of the police force, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and expected to live only one year, she wishes to pass on her pension to her domestic partner of five years, Stacie Andree. Although New Jersey counties have the option to extend pension benefits to domestic partners, Ocean County Freeholders will not do this. In protest, the state's LGBT civil rights organization, Garden State Equality, organizes hundreds of people to speak out at each of the Freeholders' meetings. The crowds Garden State Equality organizes get bigger and more vociferous at each meeting.Among those speaking out are Laurel's police colleagues and Ocean County residents, describing Laurel's 25 years of exemplary work for the police department, and petitioning the Freeholders to allow her to pass on her pension to Stacie. Laurel's first police partner, Dane Wells, speaks about her and compares the situation to separate drinking fountains and seats at the back of the bus. Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment.

CAIRO — The Egyptian government on Thursday broadened its crackdown on a 10-day uprising that has shaken its rule, arresting journalists and human rights advocates across an edgy city, while offering more concessions in a bid to win support from a population growing frustrated with a devastated economy and scenes of chaos in the streets. The campaign was a startling blend of the oldest tactics of an authoritarian government — stoking fears of foreigners — with the air of sincerity of a repentant order. Trying to seize the initiative from a revolt that has marked one of the most decisive moments in modern Egyptian history, the government promised that neither President Hosni Mubarak nor his son Gamal, long seen as a contender for power, would run for president and offered dialogue with the banned Muslim Brotherhood, gestures almost unthinkable weeks ago. As protesters battled crowds rallied by the government for a second day, organizers sought to rally even bigger demonstrations for Friday — dubbed the “Friday of departure” — in hopes of keeping the momentum behind a popular uprising that has demanded that Mr. Mubarak step down after three decades in power. Voiced often in the tumultuous scenes of defiance and determination in Tahrir Square was a fear that if they lost, the protesters and their organizers would bear the brunt of a withering crackdown. “If we can’t bring this to an end, we’re going to all be in the slammer by June,” said Murad Mohsen, a doctor treating the wounded at a makeshift clinic near barricades, where thousands fought off droves of government supporters with rocks and firebombs. Dr. Mohsen’s comments illustrated the changing dynamic of an uprising that has captivated the Arab world, reverberating through Jordan, Sudan and Yemen, where there were peaceful protests on Thursday. New calls for protests went out in Algeria, Bahrain and Libya. From festive scenes of just days ago, the revolt has become more martial, as exhausted men defend what they describe as the perimeter of a free Egypt around Tahrir Square. Their demands have grown more forceful and the uprising more radical. After pitched clashes of two days that left at least seven dead and hundreds wounded, banners in Tahrir Square declared Mr. Mubarak “a war criminal,” and several in the crowd said that the president should be executed. Major television networks were largely unable to broadcast from the square on Thursday. The United States joined a chorus of criticism, with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton saying, “We condemn in the strongest terms attacks on peaceful demonstrators, human rights activists, foreigners and diplomats.” The government’s strategy seems motivated at turning broader opinion in the country against the protests and perhaps wearing down the demonstrators themselves, some of whom seemed exhausted by the clashes. Vice President Omar Suleiman, appointed Saturday to a position that Mr. Mubarak had until then refused to fill, appealed to Egypt’s sense of decency in allowing Mr. Mubarak to serve out his term, and he chronicled the mounting losses that, he said, the uprising had inflicted on a crippled Egyptian economy. “End your sit-in,” he said. “Your demands have been answered.” Mr. Mubarak said in an interview with ABC that he was eager to step down but if he did, “Egypt would sink into chaos.” In interviews and statements, the government has increasingly spread an image that foreigners were inciting the uprising, a refrain echoed in the streets. The suggestions are part of a days-long Egyptian media campaign that has portrayed the protesters as troublemakers and ignored the scope of an uprising with diffuse goals and leadership. “Millions turn out to support Mubarak,” read the banner headline on Thursday on the front page of Al Ahram, the leading government newspaper. The propaganda has been so pronounced that an announcer on Nile Television, Shahira Amin, quit. “I cleared my conscience and walked out,” she said. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it had 100 reports of attacks on journalists. Al Jazeera, the influential Arabic channel, said government supporters stormed the Hilton Hotel in Cairo, searching for journalists, and two of its reporters were attacked. A Greek journalist was stabbed with a screwdriver and others were beaten and harassed. Police also raided the Hisham Mubarak Law Center, a headquarters for many of the international human rights organizations working in Egypt. The human rights workers were told to lie on the floor and the chips were removed from the telephones, someone present in the building said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. As the day wore on, tension descended across parts of the city, which is still guarded by popular committees that banded together after the police withdrew Saturday. Government supporters roamed parts of the downtown, itching for a fight, and looters set fire to a shopping mall along the Nile that was already looted and burned Friday. ||||| Follow live blogging on \\"This Just In\\" and the latest tweets from CNN correspondents from the protests.

Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Heavy gunfire reverberated in central Cairo before dawn Thursday as supporters and foes of embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak continued to face off at Tahrir Square, where chunks of concretes and Molotov cocktails were employed as weapons in the escalating crisis. CNN personnel saw wounded people being carried into Tahrir Square, largely held by anti-regime demonstrators, through an entrance that leads to the nearby Egyptian Museum. Several ambulances entered and left the square shortly before 4 a.m. Thursday. The source of the gunfire was not immediately known. Voices were heard chanting a prayer after a day of violent street battles in central Cairo. Sustained automatic weapons fire, including from what sounded like a heavy machine gun, echoed around the square, the epicenter of nine days of protests calling for Mubarak's ouster. Anti-government demonstrators hunkered down behind makeshift barricades in the square and outside the nearby national museum against the onslaught, which demonstrators said included plainclothes police officers. \\"They're coming in with weapons. They're spreading violence,\\" human rights activist Gigi Ibrahim told CNN on Wednesday. \\"We've had peaceful protests here since Friday and no violence here. Only today were we faced with this really violent reaction.\\" The pro-government protesters were not impeded by the army when they entered the square, CNN's Ben Wedeman said early Thursday. Anti-regime protesters are now unhappy with troops, whose commanders had promised Monday not to use force against peaceful demonstrations, for standing by, he said. Small fires burned in the square early Thursday, some spreading to trees and walls. Egypt's health ministry reported four people were killed and 829 were wounded in Wednesday's clashes, according to the state television network. Reported fatalities in the previous eight days of demonstrations ranged as high as 300, but CNN has not been able to independently confirm the death toll. In one surreal moment, whip-wielding Mubarak supporters thundered through the crowd astride horses and camels, and at least one man was pulled off his mount and beaten. A Mubarak supporter who spoke to CNN said the riders were pyramid workers who were protesting the negative economic impact of the crisis. \\"What you are seeing is the demonstration of the real Egyptian people who are trying to take back their country, trying to take back their street,\\" said businessman Khaled Ahmed, who described himself as \\"pro-Egyptian.\\" But some observers said the pro-Mubarak push Wednesday was likely orchestrated by a regime bent on breaking up peaceful demonstrations. \\"These are tactics that are well-known in Egypt,\\" Michele Dunne, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN's John King. Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution said the \\"rent-a-thugs\\" were likely sanctioned and paid by the government. This is meant to create an image of chaos so the government can move in to restore order, he said. \\"Mubarak has -- now, certainly, with the violence today, but even before that -- lost the confidence of the overwhelming number of the Egyptian people,\\" Kagan said. As night fell, the sound of gunfire reverberated in Tahrir Square, the name of which means \\"liberation\\" in Arabic. People hurled verbal insults, Molotov cocktails, rocks and anything else they could find -- shards of metal, sticks, shoes -- at one another. Desperate for more ammunition, they dismantled sidewalks and picked up chunks of cement to throw. They beat each other in what rapidly spiraled into utter mayhem. Hundreds of injured people were treated by doctors and medical staff, who turned to volunteers for assistance. CNN iReporter Hunter Moore, 26, helped treat the wounded. The U.S. schoolteacher said Tuesday's crowds at Tahrir Square were mostly peaceful. \\"It went downhill really, really quickly\\" on Wednesday, he told CNN. It was unclear whether such confrontations were being repeated elsewhere. Other Cairo neighborhoods were calm, and rallies in Egypt's second-largest city, Alexandria, were largely peaceful. Mubarak's opponents had stood shoulder to shoulder in Tahrir Square to call for his immediate resignation in a massive rally on Tuesday. The 82-year-old president's announcement that night that he would spend the remaining seven months of his current term working to ensure a \\"peaceful transition of power\\" failed to satisfy them, and they vowed to keep up the pressure on him to resign. The crisis has paralyzed the Egyptian economy, as the government has closed banks, idled trains and shuttered schools. Markets are running short of basic food staples, and the situation is hurting the ability of ordinary citizens to join the demonstrations, opposition activist Ziad Aly told CNN. \\"We can't get enough bread. We can't get enough food supplies,\\" he said. Vice President Omar Suleiman reiterated the government stance that the people have been heard, that they should go home and that they should stop demonstrating. Protesters should respect the curfew and \\"enable people to return to their jobs and their daily lives, and to allow schools and universities to reopen,\\" he said in a statement. The state-run television network, Nile TV, sought to portray the unrest as a \\"foreign conspiracy\\" fueled by international journalists, several of whom -- including CNN's Anderson Cooper -- were attacked during Wednesday's clashes. Despite reports that shots had been fired, Nile TV's reporters denied any shooting had taken place or even that violence had broken out in Tahrir Square. The network also said that members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood were heading to the square \\"to throw balls of fire and to start acts of riots and violence.\\" When asked if that were true, Mohamed Morsy, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, said the action came from all segments of the Egyptian people, \\"not the Muslim Brotherhood only.\\" Morsy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the time for change is now, not when Mubarak's term ends. \\"We need a new era, a new regime,\\" Morsy said. \\"We have a constitution.\\" Asked whether Suleiman could lead the government until new elections, Morsy said the head of the country's supreme court should fulfill that role. In Washington, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said an end to violence was \\"imperative.\\" \\"It is our hope that what we saw today, we won't see tomorrow or Friday or into the weekend,\\" he said. But Mubarak's government bluntly told outsiders to mind their own business. \\"Our interactions within our country are Egyptian affairs and nothing more than that,\\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki said. Egypt \\"will continue to be a beacon of moderation and stability in our region,\\" he said, but its people must settle their differences without \\"intervention from the outside.\\" Though Mubarak's concessions were large and remarkable for a man who has held a tight grip on power for three decades, it was too little, too late for many Egyptians. \\"He is unfortunately going to continue the agony for another six or seven months,\\" opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei said Tuesday night. However, Mubarak supporter Waleed Tawfik told CNN that not all Egyptians agree that Mubarak should step down immediately. \\"Change will not happen overnight. There's not a magical button for change. Change will take time,\\" he said. The Egyptian army can't sit on the sidelines too much longer, or it could risk unraveling, said a foreign policy expert. The army needs to pick a course of action by Friday, when more mass protests are expected after prayers, Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN's \\"Parker Spitzer.\\" The Egyptian crisis is among the aftershocks of the revolt in Tunisia that forced that nation's longtime strongman to flee to Saudi Arabia in mid-January. In Yemen, President Ali Abdullah Saleh -- who has been in office for 32 years -- said Wednesday he will not run for president nor hand over power to his son once his current term ends in 2013.

Plants have genes. Animals have genes. You have genes. Genes are the basic units of heredity . Heredity means all the characteristics you inherit from your parents. You get your genes from your parents. You inherit half of your genes from your mother. You inherit half of your genes from your father. Genes are a kind of code. A tree's genes tell what shape its leaves will be. A cat's genes tell what color1 its fur will be. Your genes tell what color1 your eyes will be. Your genes tell what color1 your hair will be. Everything about you comes from the code in your genes. Genes line up on strands called chromosomes in cells. Everything alive is made up of cells. Chromosomes are in the center, or nucleus, of cells. An Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel first saw inherited patterns in pea plants. He experimented with pea plants in the 1860s. One of the things, or traits , Mendel studied was what makes some pea plants tall and some short. He said that the traits must come from units of heredity passed from the parent plants. These units were called genes. In the mid-1900s, scientists discovered that genes are made of DNA. In the 1970s, scientists learned how to change DNA with genetic engineering. Scientists also learned that problems with certain genes cause diseases. Muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and hemophilia are some genetic diseases--diseases caused by problems in genes. Today, scientists are looking for ways to cure genetic diseases by _ genes through a process called gene therapy. Question: If one's father has blue eyes, while his mother has grey ones, _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"It is probably their son will have either blue eyes or grey ones.\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"It is probably their son will have either blue eyes or grey ones.\\" is a reasonable conclusion based on the information provided in the article. Eye color is determined by multiple genes inherited from both parents. Since the father has blue eyes and the mother has grey ones, it is likely that the child would inherit a combination of the genes responsible for determining eye color from both parents, which could result in either blue, grey, or a mixture of both eye colors in the child. As mentioned in the article, genetics are based on heredity, which means that each person inherits half of their genes from their mother and half from their father. Eye color is a polygenic trait, meaning that it is controlled by more than one gene. The specific combination of genes inherited from both the mother and father will determine the child's eye color. Although it is probable that the child will have either blue or grey eyes, it should be noted that genetics can be complex, and other eye colors could also be possible depending on the other genes inherited from their ancestors. It is important to remember that while genetics plays a significant role in determining a person's characteristics, there are many factors involved, and sometimes, the results may not be as straightforward as one might expect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: There are many tables that have information on the average bond energies for a specific bond. These tables can be found online or in a chemistry book. It is important to note that these bond energies are always for molecules in a gaseous state. For our example, you need to find the bond energy for an H-H bond, a Br-Br bond, and an H-Br bond. H-H = 436 kJ/mol; Br-Br = 193 kJ/mol; H-Br = 366 kJ/mol. To calculate bond energy for molecules in a liquid state, you need to also look up the enthalpy change of vaporization for the liquid molecule. This is the amount of energy needed to convert the liquid into a gas. This number is added to the total bond energy. For example: If you were given liquid water, you would need to add the enthalpy change of vaporization of water (+41 kJ) to the equation. In some equations, you may have the same bond broken multiple times. For example, if 4 atoms of hydrogen are in the molecule, then the bond energy of hydrogen must be counted 4 times, or multiplied by 4. In our example, there is only 1 bond of each molecule, so the bond energies are simply multiplied by 1. H-H = 436 x 1 = 436 kJ/mol Br-Br = 193 x 1 = 193 kJ/mol Once you have multiplied the bond energies by the number of the individual bonds, you need to then sum all of the bonds on the reactant side. For our example, the sum of the bonds broken is H-H + Br-Br = 436 + 193 = 629 kJ/mol. Just as you did for the bonds broken on the reactant side, you will multiply the number of bonds formed by its respective bond energy. If you have 4 hydrogen bonds formed, you would need to multiply that bond energy by 4. For our example we have 2 H-Br bonds formed, so the bond energy of H-Br (366 kJ/mol) will be multiplied by 2: 366 x 2 = 732 kJ/mol. Again, like you did with the bonds broken, you will add up all of the bonds formed on the product side. Sometimes you will only have 1 product formed and can skip this step. In our example, there is only 1 product formed, so the energy of the bonds formed is simply the energy of the 2 H-Br bonds or 732 kJ/mol. Once you have summed all of the bond energies for both sides, simply subtract the formed bonds from the broken bonds. Remember the equation: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed). Plug in the calculated values and subtract. For our example: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed) = 629 kJ/mol - 732 kJ/mol = -103 kJ/mol. The final step to calculating bond energy is to determine whether the reaction releases energy or consumes energy. An endothermic (one that consumes energy) will have a final bond energy that is positive, while an exothermic reaction (one that releases energy) will have a negative bond energy. In our example, the final bond energy is negative, therefore, the reaction is exothermic.","completion":"This article explains the process of calculating bond energies in a detailed manner. Bond energy tables, which contain average bond energies for specific bonds, can be found online or in chemistry books. It's important to note that bond energies refer to molecules in a gaseous state. For illustration, the article provides bond energies for H-H, Br-Br, and H-Br bonds. To determine bond energies in a liquid state, the enthalpy change of vaporization must be considered, which is the energy required to convert the liquid to a gas. Given an example of liquid water, the enthalpy change of vaporization should be added to the equation. When a bond is present multiple times within a molecule, its bond energy must be multiplied by the total occurrences of the bond. Using the example, the H-H and Br-Br bonds are present only once each, so their bond energies are simply multiplied by one. Next, the bond energies on the reactant side are summed, and the number of bonds formed is multiplied by their respective bond energies. The bonds formed on the product side are then added up. In the example provided, only one product is formed, so the energy of the 2 H-Br bonds is considered. Subtracting the energy of the formed bonds from the energy of the broken bonds results in the final bond energy, calculated using the equation: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed). In the given example, the reaction results in a negative bond energy, indicating that it is an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases energy. An endothermic reaction, on the other hand, consumes energy and would have a positive bond energy."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: Everybody learns about germs in school, but if you want an expert talk to a what?

Q:Information: - A mountain bike or mountain bicycle (abbreviated Mtn Bike, MTB; or ATB, for all-terrain bicycle) is a bicycle designed for off-road cycling. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes, but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. These typically include suspension on the frame and fork, large knobby tires, more durable heavy duty wheels, more powerful brakes, and lower gear ratios needed for steep grades with poor traction. - Downhill is an alpine skiing discipline. Unlike the other alpine skiing events, slalom, giant slalom, super giant slalom, and combined, which emphasize turning and technique, downhill is more about speed. Speeds of up to are common in international competition. Athletes must have an aerodynamically efficient tuck position to minimize drag and increase speed. - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races. - George David Atherton , known as Gee Atherton ( born 26 February 1985 , near Salisbury , England ) is a professional racing cyclist specialising in downhill and four cross mountain bike racing , and is a multiple national champion , multiple World Cup winner , 2010 Downhill World Cup Champion , and 2010 & 2014 Downhill World Champion . - Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the sport or recreation of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games). - The Union Cycliste Internationale, commonly known by the acronym UCI, is the world governing body for sports cycling and oversees international competitive cycling events. The UCI is based in Aigle, Switzerland. - Mountain bike racing (shortened MTB or ATB racing) is a competitive cycle sport held on off-road terrain. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) recognised the discipline relatively late in 1990, when it sanctioned the world championships in Durango, Colorado. The first UCI Mountain Bike World Cup series took place in 1988. Its nine-race circuit covered two continentsEurope and North Americaand was sponsored by Grundig. Cross-country racing was the only World Cup sport at this time. In 1993, a six-event downhill World Cup was introduced. In 1996, cross-country mountain biking events were added to the Olympic Games. In 2006, cross-country mountain biking events became part of the World Deaf Cycling Championships for the first time in San Francisco, USA.

Article: These are the words of the captain of TransAsia Airways Flight GE235, eight seconds before the plane clipped a bridge and plunged into a Taiwanese river mere minutes after takeoff, killing 43 people on board. The latest report by Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council into the February crash confirms that the captain of the ATR 72-600 turboprop aircraft mistakenly switched off the plane's working engine after the other lost power. The plane is designed to be able to be flown on one engine. The report also showed that the captain had failed simulator training less than a year earlier, partly because he had demonstrated a lack of knowledge of how to respond to engine flameout at takeoff. The aircraft, which was less than a year old, flew perilously between buildings and clipped a bridge and a taxi before crashing into the shallow Keelung River in Taiwan's capital, Taipei. Fifteen of the 58 people on board the flight, all mainland Chinese or from Taiwan, survived. The plane's entire cockpit crew was killed in the crash, authorities said. Engine flameout The findings come in the Aviation Safety Council's Factual Data Collection Group Report , a presentation of facts found in investigating the crash. The report draws no conclusions and makes no recommendations, and a final report is to follow in April 2016. The report showed that less than a minute after takeoff, once the plane had climbed 1,200 feet, a master warning sounded, and a display showed that there had been an engine flameout, or power failure, in engine 2. The captain responded by pulling back on the throttle -- but on the other, working engine, shutting it off about 46 seconds after the other engine failed, causing the aircraft to stall. The mistake was not noticed until about two minutes later, when the pilot managed to restore some power to engine 1, but it was too late to avoid the crash.

MUST WATCH TransAsia grounds 10 pilots for failing test 02:09 According to records provided to the investigators by TransAsia, the captain had previously served in the Taiwan Air Force as a pilot. He worked for another airline briefly after leaving the Air Force, before joining TransAsia in August 2010. He served as a first officer in the ATR 72-500 fleet, before completing upgrade training and being promoted to captain in August 2014. In November that year, he completed further training to transfer to the ATR 72-600 fleet as captain. TransAsia training records show that during his upgrade training in April 2014, he failed a simulator check, performing unsatisfactorily on the abnormal engine start section, among others. Among the areas of concern was that he demonstrated insufficient knowledge of dealing with engine flameout at takeoff, the instructor noted. The pilot was given another session and qualified as captain after passing the simulator check. 'Insufficient knowledge' JUST WATCHED Was TransAsia Flight GE235 safe? Replay More Videos ...

Hide Caption 21 of 21 Since the crash in February, the Taiwanese carrier had recruited aviation safety professionals, including Jon Beatty, CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation, to join its aviation committee to provide advice, the statement said. The airline had brought manufacturers of its aircraft to Taiwan to examine its planes, and had had all captains of its ATR craft sit \\"appropriateness\\" exams, which they had passed, it said. TransAsia had also improved its training facilities, founding a training center and purchasing simulation planes, and had made other improvements including forming an aviation safety committee and boosting pay for staff, the airline said. ||||| TAIPEI/SINGAPORE The pilot flying a TransAsia Airways (6702.TW) ATR mistakenly switched off the plane's only working engine seconds before it crashed in February, killing 43 people, Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council (ASC) said in its latest report on Thursday. The ASC's report also showed that Captain Liao Jian-zong had failed simulator training in May 2014, in part because he had insufficient knowledge of how to deal with an engine flame-out on take-off. \\"Wow, pulled back the wrong side throttle,\\" Liao, 41, was heard to say on voice recordings seconds before the crash. There appeared to be confusion in the cockpit as the two captains tried to regain control of the plane after one engine lost power about three minutes into the doomed flight. Liao reduced the throttle on the working engine but did not appear to realize his mistake until it was too late. He tried to restart the engines several times before a junior first officer in the cockpit said: \\"Impact, impact, brace for impact.\\" Those were the chilling last words heard on the data recordings, according to the latest report of the ASC's investigation into the Feb. 4 crash. Seconds later the almost new ATR 72-600, which had 58 people on board, crashed upside down into a shallow river in Taipei after it lurched between buildings, clipping an overpass and a taxi. Fifteen people survived but all three pilots and 40 passengers and other crew died in the second crash involving a TransAsia ATR plane in a year. A source with direct knowledge of the report told Reuters on Wednesday the working engine had been shut off. FAILED SIMULATOR TRAINING The ASC report, which neither assigns responsibility nor suggests recommendations, paints a more detailed picture than a preliminary report released days after the crash. Liao, a former air force pilot, began flying commercial aircraft in 2009 and joined TransAsia the following year. He was promoted to captain in August 2014 and joined the ATR 72-600 fleet in November. He had a total of 4,914 flight hours on ATR 72 planes. However, the report showed that Liao failed the simulator check in May 2014 when he was being evaluated for promotion. Assessors found he had a tendency not to complete procedures and checks, and his \\"cockpit management and flight planning\\" were also found wanting. However, he passed after a second simulator check on June 29 and 30 and was promoted to captain, although similar problems were detected during training from July 2-10 last year. Instructors commented that he was \\"prone to be nervous and may make oral errors during the engine start procedure\\" and displayed a \\"lack of confidence\\", the report shows. Issues cropped up again during training for the ATR 72-600 in November, when an instructor said Liao \\"may need extra training\\" when dealing with an engine failure after take-off. After the crash, Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration put TransAsia's ATR pilots through oral proficiency tests on how to handle an aircraft during engine failure. All but one of the pilots passed the tests, although some needed more than one attempt. The lone failure was demoted in rank to vice captain from captain. The airline now has 61 ATR pilots. TransAsia president Fred Wu told a media conference later on Thursday the airline would buy an ATR flight simulator, bring in outside experts to evaluate pilots, and launch a safety improvement program with Airbus (AIR.PA). ATR is a joint venture between Airbus and Alenia Aermacchi, a subsidiary of Italian aerospace firm Finmeccanica (SIFI.MI). The airline has reached a settlement with the families of seven passengers, and negotiations were underway with the rest, said TransAsia CEO Peter Chen. A draft of the final report will be issued in November with the final report, which will include the cause of the crash and recommendations, to be completed in April 2016.

The reviewer expresses their love for the kids' workout classes and overall enjoyment of their membership. They also mention having had a positive experience with the daycare facilities provided almost two years ago. These aspects of the review are positive in nature and reflect satisfaction with various services offered by the establishment. However, the reviewer does express a significant issue with the pool's operating hours, which is limited to 12-5 pm, the hottest part of the day. This restricts the opportunity for the reviewer's husband to use the facility, causing frustration and a desire for an extended schedule until 8 pm. This particular aspect of their experience is negative, as it showcases dissatisfaction and unmet expectations. In summary, while the review does contain a major negative aspect regarding the pool's availability, the overall sentiment leans towards positive due to the reviewer's love for the kids' workout classes, satisfaction with their membership, and prior positive experiences with the daycare services.

Question: Given the background: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. and the situation: Two friends met after 20 years and compared diets. Paul ate junk food daily and weighed 300 lbs and was 5'8'' in height. Mike was vegan and stayed healthy and thin. Answer the following question: Which friend had less unused energy in food? Answer:","completion":"Mike, the friend who followed a vegan diet, likely had less unused energy in food compared to Paul, who regularly consumed junk food. There are several reasons for this conclusion. Firstly, junk food typically contains a high amount of calories, often in the form of unhealthy fats and sugars. These types of foods provide a significant amount of energy but lack essential nutrients, like vitamins and minerals. As a result, when people like Paul consume more energy than they need through junk food, their bodies store this excess energy in the form of fat. This storage can lead to weight gain and obesity, as illustrated by Paul's weight of 300 lbs and height of 5'8\\". In contrast, Mike followed a vegan diet, which emphasizes whole, plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes that are naturally lower in calories and fats while providing vital nutrients. Consuming a well-planned vegan diet can help individuals meet their nutritional needs and maintain a healthy weight. Since Mike is described as healthy and thin, it can be inferred that he consumed an appropriate amount of energy from his food, allowing him to maintain an ideal weight and avoid any significant energy storage in the form of body fat. Moreover, obesity can increase the risk of health problems, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Since Paul had a higher BMI and met the criteria for obesity, the chances of him having unused energy in his food were greater than Mike, who maintained a healthy weight and was at a lower risk for such health complications. In conclusion, based on their respective diets and weight profiles, it is more likely that Mike, the vegan friend, had less unused energy in food compared to Paul, who consumed junk food daily. By choosing plant-based foods and avoiding the empty calories often found in junk food, Mike was able to maintain a healthier weight and minimize the storage of unused energy as fat."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"Before Addison can execute the rebels, there are several steps that need to be taken. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the process: 1. Gather intelligence about the rebels: Addison needs to gather information on the rebels responsible for the village attack, including their location, numbers, and leadership. This may involve using scouts, informants, or other intelligence sources. 2. Develop a capture strategy: Based on the information gathered, Addison must create a plan for capturing the rebels. This could involve coordinating with local military forces, planning a surprise attack, or setting a trap for the rebels. 3. Capture the rebels: Addison and his team, with support from any allied forces, must carry out the plan to capture the rebels. This might involve a direct confrontation, a covert operation, or something in-between. The goal is to apprehend the rebels with minimal casualties on both sides. 4. Secure the prisoners: Once the rebels are captured, they must be secured in a location where they cannot escape or pose a threat to themselves or others. This could involve transporting them to a jail, detention center, or other secure facility. 5. Gather evidence: Now that the rebels are in custody, Addison must gather evidence to support the accusations against them. This can include witness statements, documentation, physical evidence, or anything else that proves their involvement in the attack on the village. 6. Trial: In order to maintain a fair and just process, Addison should ensure that each captive rebel has a fair and impartial trial. This might involve appointing an impartial judge, giving the rebels access to legal representation, and presenting evidence that confirms their guilt. 7. Sentencing: If the rebels are found guilty, they will need to be sentenced according to the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction. In this case, Addison has decided to execute them, presumably because the severity of their crimes justifies the death penalty. By completing these steps, Addison can ensure that he handles the situation in a just and responsible manner, providing the accused with a fair trial, and ensuring that their punishment is in line with the severity of their crimes."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Elevated CO2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops, with wheat, rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12–14% under elevated CO2 in FACE experiments.Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased water-use efficiency. Studies using FACE have shown that CO2 enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants.

Context: SEOUL — The U.S. has indicated it is prepared to open the North Korean economy to significant private investment, if a nuclear deal can be reached. But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

To further elaborate, let's first define VPN and then look at how the sentences relate to each other. VPN (or Virtual Private Network) is a technology that allows users to create a secure and encrypted connection over the internet, typically employed to access resources on a private network, even when they are not physically connected to the same network. VPNs achieve this by creating a \\"tunnel\\" through the public internet, connecting the client device to the VPN server and then forwarding packets securely between them. PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) and L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) are two common VPN tunneling protocols. PPTP is an older protocol, designed by Microsoft, while L2TP is a more advanced and secure protocol that combines features of PPTP and Cisco's Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) protocol. Now, let's examine the two provided sentences: 1. Apple has also built a new VPN server into Panther Server that supports Mac OS X, Windows, or UNIX clients using PPTP and L2TP tunneling protocols. 2. A new VPN server built into Panther Server supports Mac OS X, Windows, or UNIX clients using PPTP and L2TP tunneling protocols. Both sentences describe the same key points: - Apple has built a new VPN server - This VPN server is integrated into Panther Server (a version of the Mac OS X operating system) - It supports clients running on Mac OS X, Windows, or UNIX systems - These clients can use PPTP and L2TP tunneling protocols to establish a secure connection.

Summarize: Victory in the 200m final at Rio 2016 means the 29-year-old needs another win in the 4x100m relay alongside his Jamaican team-mates at 02:35 BST on Saturday to complete an unprecedented 'treble treble' of Olympic sprint golds in the 100m, 200m and relay. He's done it all while athletics has been struggling to maintain its popularity, a succession of doping scandals draining away people's belief in what they're watching. It's not too much of a stretch to describe Bolt as his sport's saviour. His remarkable feats can, briefly, bring the world to a halt, while he possesses a magnetic appeal that transcends track and field and crosses generations. Why is he so popular? And, as BBC TV's Olympic coverage asked in the aftermath of his latest gold, what on earth are we going to do without him? Unaffected, laid-back but always the showman, Bolt makes the superhuman seem routine and his easy charm is hugely endearing. Of course, people are also awed by watching staggering sporting feats - like setting world records in the 100m of 9.58 seconds and the 200m of 19.19 seconds - but it's the way he does it that makes Bolt different. Not for him the muscular machismo of many sprinters. Swaying, dancing and posing before and after races, he looks like he's having a great time and the sense of fun is infectious. While the time we see him in action is oh so brief, he appears to have all the time in the world for fans and journalists once his business is complete. Media playback is not supported on this device His laps of honour feature a seemingly endless stream of selfies for thrilled supporters, with Bolt providing a smile for everyone. He waits patiently when some fans struggle to get the settings on their phone right and shows them how it's done when technology defeats them. Once he's amiably ambled his way round the track, it's straight into a succession of interviews,. BBC Radio 5 live's Sonia McLaughlin was number 49 in the line of media waiting to speak with Bolt after his 200m victory and he fielded similar questions with the same excitement - more than an hour after his race had finished - as he had when he spoke to the BBC's trackside television reporter Phil Jones in the immediate aftermath of his race. His appeal overwhelms some journalists who lose all semblance of professionalism and demand their own selfies. It's all in a day's work for Bolt. With his 30th birthday on Sunday and retirement due after next year's World Athletics Championships in London, let's continue to enjoy him while we still can. The man himself said: \\"What else can I do to prove I am the greatest? I'm trying to be one of the greatest, to be among Ali and Pele. I have made the sport exciting, I have made people want to see the sport. I have put the sport on a different level.\\" Fellow Jamaican Yohan Blake, 2012 Olympic 100m silver medallist and 2011 world champion: \\"Congrats to my friend and training partner Usain Bolt. Well done big man. A true inspiration and a living legend!\\" Tennis player Genie Bouchard to fellow Canadian and 200m silver medallist Andre de Grasse: \\"Silver after Bolt is really like gold am I right?\\" Wayde van Niekerk, 400m gold medallist and world record holder: \\"Congratulations Usain Bolt, King of sprints.

Here is a news article: Winter Storm In Eastern U.S. Buries Cities, Floods Coast, Kills At Least 29 Enlarge this image toggle caption Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images A massive snowstorm that affected most of the East Coast finally ended Sunday morning, leaving in its wake 1-3 feet of snow over major cities, at least 18 storm-associated casualties and severe coastal flooding. While the snow has stopped, the weather warnings continue. High winds will create blowing and drifting snow in some areas, the National Weather Service warns. And while New York City lifted a police-enforced travel ban on Sunday morning, many authorities are asking citizens to refrain from driving for another day as efforts to clear off the roads continue. The snowfall totals were striking, setting records in some jurisdictions. At the D.C. National Zoo, 22 inches of snow fell; at JFK airport in New York City, 30 inches; in the western suburbs of D.C., 36 inches were recorded; in Shepherdstown, W.V., more than 40 inches. The 26.8 inches recorded in New York's Central Park is the second-highest total ever recorded — falling short of the record by just 0.1 inches, CBS reports. Farther south, the storm's greatest impact wasn't in inches of snowfall but quarter-inches of ice. Hundreds of thousands of people lost power as ice and high winds combined to rip down power lines, and many roads were made perilous by the icy conditions. At least 29 deaths have been attributed to the storm by the Associated Press, including a Kentucky transportation worker who died while plowing highways, a teenager who was hit by a truck while sledding behind an all-terrain vehicle and two people who died of hypothermia in Virginia. Most of the deaths were from car crashes on snowy or icy roads. Four were caused by overexertion while shoveling snow. If you or someone you know is shoveling snow on Sunday, the National Safety Council has some tips on how to do so safely, including taking it slow and pushing, not lifting, the snow. Moving snow is serious physical exertion and people who don't do it frequently — no matter how healthy they are — can easily overexert themselves, the NSC says. \\"A clear driveway is not worth your life,\\" they note. Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images In addition to bringing large volumes of snow, the storm raised floodwaters along the coast. Roads have been closed and some areas have been evacuated, the Associated Press reports. The National Weather Service had warned that the storm surge accompanying the snowstorm could be extremely damaging. Officials from North Carolina to New York are concerned about the impact of the floods, the AP reports: \\"In Delaware, flooding closed a popular route to the state's beaches and forced about a dozen people to leave the low-lying community of Oak Orchard. In Ocean City, Maryland, Delmarva Power cut electricity to hundreds of customers as storm surge flooding submerged equipment used to power the downtown area.\\" In some areas, the flooding has risen even higher than it did during Hurricane Sandy three years ago, Reuters reports. Record flooding has been recorded along the Jersey Shore and Delaware Coast, according to an NWS meteorologist. ||||| Play Facebook Twitter Embed Snowmaggeddon Strikes Crippling Much of the East Coast 5:45 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog A killer snowstorm paralyzed the East Coast on Saturday, effectively shutting down New York City and the nation's capital, while dumping as much as 3 feet of snow in other areas.

The film's success is often attributed to the creative synthesis of Gothic fantasy elements, breathtaking scenic effects, and the exceptional performance of Lon Chaney in the lead role, which critics widely agree transform an absurd character into a deeply haunting one. Critics also highlight and appreciate the effort made into creating an imaginative and grotesque underworld beneath the opera house, showcasing it as a commendable element of this timeless film. There is recognition that this film may not be Chaney's best, with some slow, uneven stretches mentioned. However, there are bursts of intriguing atmosphere and peculiarities that come to life in this film and create memorable moments that have kept the film relevant over time. The 1925 version of this film underwent an enhancement process, adding a modern, Goth-inspired soundtrack from the band Switchblade Symphony, which some critics believe significantly enhanced the film's appeal.

Rifle A:","completion":"Title: \\"Ricochet\\" Plot: In 2024, a crippling international economic collapse has led to rampant crime and lawlessness across the world. The United States, once a global superpower, is now in complete disarray. Cities that were once thriving are now overrun with gang violence and criminal activity. Jack Thompson, a former Marine Scout Sniper, now makes a living as a farmer in a small, peaceful rural town called Liberty in Montana. His father's cherished hunting rifle is the only reminder of his past life. One day, ruthless outlaw motorcycle gang leader, Cyrus \\"The Beast\\" Maddox, and his gang sweep through Liberty, leaving terror and destruction in their wake. In an unexpected and merciless attack, they mercilessly murder Jack's family and burn down his farm. Consumed by grief and rage, Jack takes it upon himself to single-handedly bring vengeance upon Cyrus and his gang. With his father's hunting rifle and his sharp shooting skills, Jack becomes the elusive \\"Ricochet,\\" systematically hunting down and eliminating members of Cyrus' gang with an unmatched precision. Along the way, Jack uncovers a dark secret: Cyrus has connections to a corrupt government organization responsible for the illegal arms smuggling business across the U.S. borders. The gang leader promises to grant him access to a new type of advanced weapon that could change the face of warfare forever if he brings the notorious 'Ricochet' down. Jack must now not only fight for his own vendetta but also to prevent a more sinister global threat from emerging. Partnering with a fearless veteran ex-FBI agent, Emma Travers, they unravel the massive arms conspiracy and wage a relentless battle against Cyrus, his gang, and the corrupt government officials protecting them. As the stakes get higher, Jack must come face-to-face with Cyrus and the ruthless enforcers who guard the secrets of this powerful weapon. Still undefeated, \\"Ricochet\\" will become the hero he never imagined he could, bringing a moment of justice to a crumbling world and ultimately, finding his road to redemption. In a thrilling climax, Jack uses his father's hunting rifle to shoot the powerful weapon's unstable energy core, causing a massive, multi-ricochet explosion taking out Cyrus and the arms facility. Witnessing the destruction that the weapon almost unleashed, Jack is haunted by the true cost of warfare. In the aftermath, Jack and Emma decide to dedicate their lives to bringing the remaining corrupt government officials to justice. They establish a covert vigilante team called \\"The Liberty Resurgence\\" to prevent future threats to the world's stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Perpetual Virginity of Mary asserts Mary's real and perpetual virginity even in the act of giving birth to the Son of God made Man. The term Ever-Virgin (Greek ἀειπάρθενος) is applied in this case, stating that Mary remained a virgin for the remainder of her life, making Jesus her biological and only son, whose conception and birth are held to be miraculous. While the Orthodox Churches hold the position articulated in the Protoevangelium of James that Jesus' brothers and sisters are older children of Joseph the Betrothed, step-siblings from an earlier marriage that left him widowed, Roman Catholic teaching follows the Latin father Jerome in considering them Jesus' cousins.

The statement \\"Music swells\\" simply indicates that the volume or intensity of the music is increasing. The term \\"swelling\\" here is often used as a metaphor to describe music when it grows progressively louder or more intense. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"Music grows\\" is ambiguous. It could refer to several aspects of music such as its popularity, complexity, duration, or even its volume. If we interpret \\"music grows\\" as increasing in volume or intensity, then it might be possible to conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. This is because swelling music suggests a growth in its intensity or volume. However, this interpretation is only one of several possible meanings for the phrase \\"music grows.\\" In a more general sense, \\"music grows\\" can refer to its development over time, its evolution in terms of genres, or its progress in relation to society and culture. With this interpretation, the hypothesis is not necessarily entailed by the premise. The statement about the music swelling pertains only to a specific moment in the piece and does not provide any information about the growth of music as a whole or over a period of time.

This is because the premise directly mentions the key elements that correspond with the hypothesis: 1. The principal exhibition area, the planetarium and aquarium, and the submarine Argonaute are covered by the entry fee (or Museum Pass), which implies that the main attractions of the museum are included in the fee. The hypothesis states that \\"most of the museum is covered by a fee,\\" so this part corresponds directly to the premise. 2. The premise then states that \\"all other activities even the creative play areas for young children cost extra\\". This clearly indicates that these additional activities are not covered by the entry fee and therefore require additional payment. The hypothesis proposes that \\"the extra play areas cost extra,\\" which aligns with this portion of the premise. By examining these two key elements of the premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Most of the museum is covered by a fee, but the extra play areas cost extra\\" is supported by the information provided. However, it is important to consider other potential factors such as the overall size and scope of the museum, along with the relative proportion of the additional activities and play areas in comparison to the main attractions covered by the entry fee. Although the premise specifically mentions some key details, it does not provide exhaustive information about the entire museum and all of its attractions. Consequently, while the hypothesis appears true based on the provided information, it may be necessary to consider other details and sources to better understand the overall cost structure and attractions of the museum. Nevertheless, the given premise does affirm that a significant portion of the museum—including the principal exhibition area, planetarium and aquarium, and the submarine Argonaute—are covered by a single fee, while the extra play areas and other activities are not included in the entry fee and require additional payment. Consequently, based on the information given, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Most of the museum is covered by a fee, but the extra play areas cost extra\\" is an accurate representation of the museum's pricing structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

That might seem an extraordinary act of selflessness for someone turning 20. But there's increasing evidence that commitment to community service is becoming much more ordinary to today's young adults. \\"Young adults are doing more volunteer service than in any point in history,'' said Scott Seider, an assistant professor of education at Boston University who studies the civic development of young adults. At Harvard, the Winthrop Street Homeless Shelter is one of 86 social service programs associated with the Phillips Brooks House Association, which is a student-run nonprofit organization. Students can work with deaf children, bring pets to nursing homes, and prepare Chinese students to become US citizens, and so on. Volunteerism develops well outside of colleges, too. Applications to AmeriCorps have risen to a very high level, jumping from 91,399 in 2008 to 258,829 in 2010.

Spend 20-30 minutes in a sauna daily to sweat out drugs. Add 2 cups (400 grams) of Epsom salts to your bath water. Article:","completion":"Title: Enhancing Wellness through Aerobic Exercises, Sauna Treatments, and Epsom Salt Baths Introduction The pursuit of a healthy lifestyle has become a top priority for countless individuals across the globe. People are increasingly recognizing the importance of adopting conscientious practices to improve and maintain their overall well-being. Engaging in aerobic exercises, spending time in a sauna, and incorporating Epsom salts in baths are three effective methods for boosting wellness. Let's explore each of these practices in detail to uncover the wide-ranging benefits they offer. Aerobic Exercises for Fat Burning and Cardiovascular Health Aerobic exercises, also known as cardiovascular exercises, encompass activities that elevate your heart rate and promote increased oxygen intake. These exercises are particularly effective at burning calories and shedding body fat, making them popular among those seeking weight loss or overall fitness improvement. Some common forms of aerobic exercises include walking, jogging, running, swimming, cycling, and group fitness classes such as aerobics, dance, and kickboxing. Engaging in these activities for at least 20-30 minutes per day, four to five times per week, is recommended to reap significant health benefits. In addition to aiding weight loss, regular aerobic exercise strengthens the heart and lungs, lowers resting heart rate, improves circulation and blood pressure, and ultimately reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, studies have found that engaging in aerobic exercises can also enhance mental health, helping to alleviate stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Sauna Treatments for Detoxification and Relaxation Incorporating daily sauna treatments into your wellness routine is another effective way to detoxify your body and stimulate relaxation. Sauna sessions typically last for 20-30 minutes and are conducted in a controlled environment with high temperatures and humidity levels. Sweating induced by sauna treatments helps to eliminate toxins and impurities from the body, including harmful drugs and heavy metals. In addition, saunas promote increased circulation, opening up blood vessels and enhancing the delivery of oxygen to muscles and other tissues. Aside from physical benefits, saunas may also improve mental well-being. The therapeutic heat helps to relieve tension, stress, and physical discomfort, as well as promote relaxation and an overall sense of tranquility. Some reports have even suggested that spending time in a sauna could potentially boost the production of feel-good hormones like endorphins and serotonin, resulting in enhanced mood and reduced feelings of depression. Epsom Salt Baths for Muscle Recovery and Stress Relief Epsom salts, which are made of magnesium and sulfate, provide numerous therapeutic benefits when added to a warm bath. It is generally suggested to add 2 cups (400 grams) of Epsom salts to your bath water and soak in it for at least 20 minutes. Magnesium is a crucial mineral responsible for several physiological functions, including muscle and nerve function, blood sugar regulation, and the production of proteins and energy. Soaking in an Epsom salt bath allows your body to absorb magnesium through the skin, which can help to improve muscle and nerve function, reduce inflammation, and alleviate muscle soreness. Moreover, Epsom salt baths have been noted for their stress-relieving properties. The magnesium in Epsom salts also aids in the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that contributes to feelings of well-being and happiness. As a result, soaking in an Epsom salt bath can help to mitigate the effects of stress and promote a general sense of calm. Conclusion In conclusion, incorporating aerobic exercises, sauna treatments, and Epsom salt baths into your wellness routine can significantly enhance your physical and mental well-being. These practices not only contribute to weight loss, muscle recovery, and detoxification but also promote relaxation and an overall sense of balance. By integrating these activities into your everyday life, you stand to gain a wide range of benefits that will play an instrumental role in maintaining your long-term health and wellness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gases come to a head: Due to various geologic processes below the Earth's crust, volatile gases and compounds accumulate in pockets, eventually creating pressure. This is the initial driving force for magma movement towards the surface. 2. Pushing molten magma to the surface: The built-up pressure from these gases forces the molten magma to rise towards the Earth's surface. This can happen due to the cracks or weak spots in the crust, acting as pathways for the magma. The starting point of this process is thus the accumulation and built-up pressure of gases, which begins to push the magma toward the surface."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Comparing this with the information extracted from the context, we see that the Claymores' record consists of five wins, not six. Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the hypothesis.

Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon. Keith is a physician in a local hospital. He is treating a patient with respiratory problem. He looked at two different states of the patient's diaphragm, state A and state B. In state A the the diaphragm contracted, but in state B the diaphragm relaxed. He now needs to figure out other phenomena related to this. When would the ribcage contract, state A or state B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"State B. When the diaphragm relaxes, the volume of the chest cavity decreases, causing the ribcage to contract. This increase in air pressure inside the lungs forces air to flow out of the lungs, similar to air rushing out of a balloon.

Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland), a suspended police detective, begins his first day as a night security guard at the Mayflower, a luxury department store that was gutted by a fire and shuttered five years prior. The building still contains numerous mirrors from the store. On Ben's first night of patrol he finds a mirror that appears to be covered with handprints, but only on the reflected side of the glass. He sees an open door in the reflection while it is actually closed. Over time, Ben begins to see more intense visions, which he initially shrugs off as hallucinations. He soon finds the wallet of Gary Lewis, the previous night guard (who died at the beginning of the film). Inside is a note that says \\"Esseker\\". After viewing Garyâs crime photos Ben is convinced that the mirrors make people do things to themselves that they are not actually doing.

Given the following context: Balch Creek begins in the Forest Park neighborhood in unincorporated Multnomah County near the intersection of Northwest Skyline Boulevard and Northwest Thompson Road at the crest of the West Hills. It flows generally east about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) to its confluence with the Willamette River, a major tributary of the Columbia River. The creek drops from 1,116 feet (340 m) above sea level at its source to 46 feet (14 m) at its mouth, a total of 1,070 feet (330 m). Most of this occurs in the first 2.5 miles (4.0 km). In the hills, the stream gradient (slope) generally ranges from 15 to 30 percent interspersed with sections of less than 15 percent along the middle reaches.From its source, the creek runs east on private property near Forest Park, a large municipal park in Portland, before turning briefly south about 3 miles (5 km) from the mouth. Soon thereafter, the stream receives an unnamed tributary on the right bank and turns southeast on private property along Northwest Cornell Road. It enters the city and the Audubon Society of Portland simultaneously about 2 miles (3 km) from the mouth, receives two more unnamed tributaries on the right, and flows northeast, entering the part of Forest Park known as Macleay Park.For about 0.25 miles (0.40 km) the creek parallels Wildwood Trail, the main hiking trail in Forest Park, until reaching a former public restroom known as the Stone House. From here Balch Creek runs beside the Lower Macleay Trail, another hiking trail, for about 0.8 miles (1.3 km). Near Northwest Thurman Street, roughly 1 mile (1.6 km) from the mouth, the creek flows through a trash rack into an 84-inch (210 cm) diameter storm sewer. City workers first diverted the creek into a pipe in the early 20th century. The water empties into the Willamette River in the city's Northwest Industrial neighborhood at Outfall 17.

A love-cheat investment banker helped. his two girlfriends make more than £2million by leaking insider. information, a court heard yesterday. Thomas Ammann, 39, handed over the. confidential details about a future City takeover bid to Christina. Weckwerth and Jessica Mang, it was claimed. The two women allegedly used the. sensitive insider information to ‘almost double their money’ by buying. and selling shares in one company. Ammann, who worked at the London. offices of Japanese bank Mizuho, was one of only seven at the bank who. knew that global electronics company Canon was planning a takeover of. Dutch printing firm Oce. The German banker allegedly shared. this sensitive information with his two lovers – who had no knowledge. of each other – months before the deal became public. Weckwerth, 44,. made nearly £2million while Mang, 29, pocketed £60,000 from their. illicit trading, it was claimed. Prosecutor Amanda Pinto QC told. Southwark Crown Court yesterday that Ammann pleaded guilty to two counts. of encouraging insider dealing and two counts of insider dealing. earlier this year. She said: ‘In broad terms these two women managed to almost double their money by trading in just one stock. ‘Each of these women considered that Thomas Ammann was their boyfriend and they had no idea of the existence of the other.’ The court heard that on March 12,. 2009, Canon sent a confidential letter expressing its interest in a. takeover of Oce to a select group who were working on the deal,. including Ammann. The next day Weckwerth bought 14,500 shares in Oce, it. was alleged. Three days later, after a weekend with Ammann, she bought another 20,000 shares, the jury heard. The prosecutor added: ‘Thomas Ammann. and Christina Weckwerth sent several texts and had very long phone calls. on the evening of March 12. The following day, after another call, she. invested in those shares.’ And in April 2009 Weckwerth approached. the Bank of Cyprus with a view to setting up her own company to handle. her share trades, it was said. She hired a team of staff and made an. initial £320,000 investment from her share dealing. Lovers: Southwark Crown Court heard that neither women knew of each other's existence and both considered Ammann to be their boyfriend. Mang is said to have illegally traded in Oce shares via a Halifax account. Weckwerth, of Koenigstein im Taunus,. Germany, denies one count of insider dealing between April and November. 2009.

Using horizontal polarization, ghosting is reduced because the amount of reflection of electromagnetic waves in the p polarization (horizontal polarization off the side of a building) is generally less than s (vertical, in this case) polarization. Vertically polarized analog television has nevertheless been used in some rural areas. In digital terrestrial television such reflections are less problematic, due to robustness of binary transmissions and error correction. What is the answer to this question: What cause less problems in digital terrestrial television?","completion":"Digital terrestrial television experiences fewer problems with ghosting and multipath propagation due to the robust nature of binary transmissions and the incorporation of error correction techniques. Unlike analog television, digital television transmits data in the form of binary code, which consists of 0s and 1s, making the signal less susceptible to degradation from reflections or interference. Additionally, digital television employs error correction algorithms that can detect and correct errors in the transmitted data, ensuring a more consistent and reliable signal quality. These features make digital terrestrial television better suited to handling the challenges posed by multipath propagation in both urban and rural areas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. ‘In-Betweeners’ Are Part of a Rich Recruiting Pool for Jihadists “Many of them just take their grievances and dress them up in the garb of Islam,” Mr. Bergen said. That has become easy in the age of the internet. The attackers in San Bernardino, Orlando and New York all had expressed support for the Islamic State, and they and the Boston bombers were devotees of the voluminous online work of Mr. Awlaki, who was killed in an American drone strike in 2011. He remains highly popular on the web, where he argues that Western Muslims must reject even the friendliest non-Muslim neighbors, whom he calls “Sally Soccer Mom and Joe Six-Pack.” Mr. Rahami wrote in his journal that “Sheikh Anwar,” as well as Mr. Adnani of the Islamic State, had “said it clearly”: “Attack the kuffar,” or non-Muslims, “in their backyard.” Farhad Khosrokhavar, a sociologist at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris and the author of “Radicalization,” said Muslims in Europe more often than those in America felt “frontally rejected” by the larger society. He said he has often seen in his research individuals who felt neither French nor Arab. “In France, they are blamed for not being French enough, and when they go to their parents’ country of origin, they are blamed for not being Arab enough,” Mr. Khosrokhavar said. “That double denial can push them to adhere to a radical version of Islam, as a kind of lifeline: Since I am neither French nor Arab, neither American nor Afghan, I am Muslim and to hell with you all,” he added. These roots of radicalization do not make immigrants in general a danger. In the United States, immigrants have a lower rate of crime and violence than other Americans. Converts to Islam are disproportionately represented among Americans and Europeans drawn to extremism, and other ideologies also motivate mass violence — as in the case of Dylann Roof, who was 21 when he fatally shot nine black people last year at a church in Charleston, S.C., in the name of white supremacy. “The actual content of the ideology is secondary,” said Mr. Meloy, the psychologist. “What’s important is the identification and fixation.” But the Islamist terrorist groups target the particular anxieties of Western Muslims from immigrant backgrounds, posing recruitment as a religious loyalty test. They call on supporters to reject the nations where they live and embrace instead a devotion to the ummah, the global community of Muslims. The West is at war with Islam, they say, and you must strike out to defend your fellow Muslims. That message has been delivered with particular power by Mr. Awlaki, often reinforcing the newer propaganda efforts of the Islamic State. As an imam who counseled immigrants at three American mosques, and as a Yemeni-American who had lived in both countries and in Britain, Mr. Awlaki understood the worries of Muslims in the West. When he joined Al Qaeda, he did his best to open a gulf between them and their non-Muslim neighbors. “The important lesson to learn here is: Never, ever trust a kuffar,” Mr. Awlaki said in a 2003 lecture in London that was captured on video and remains a YouTube favorite. “Now, you might argue and say: ‘But my neighbor is such a nice person. My classmates are very nice. My co-workers — they’re just fabulous people, they’re so decent and honest.’” Yet these non-Muslims can never be relied upon, he said. Later, after moving to Yemen, he spoke not only of shunning non-Muslims, but also of attacking them. In a 2010 video, he tried to shame his listeners into choosing his brand of religion over their country. “To the Muslims in America I have this to say: How can your conscience allow you to live in peaceful coexistence with a nation that is responsible for the tyranny and crimes committed against your own brothers and sisters?” he said. “How can you have your loyalty to a government that is leading the war against Islam and Muslims?” He has led many people down the jihadist path, and not just in English-speaking countries. The Counter Extremism Project, an advocacy group based in Washington, said Wednesday that it had counted 88 “extremists” who had been influenced by Mr. Awlaki: 54 in the United States and 34 in Europe. Most such jihadist recruits are the children of immigrants, said Olivier Roy, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, and the author of “Globalized Islam.” His research shows that 65 percent of Muslim extremists in France and Belgium are from this second generation. “These young people have broken away from their parents, who they blame for many things — for practicing the wrong Islam, for having brought them to the West, for having failed in life,” Mr. Roy said, noting that Mr. Rahami reportedly had clashed with his father. But such conflicts pass. Few jihadists are from the third generation, the grandchildren of immigrants, he said. Scott Shane reported from Washington, Richard Pérez-Peña from New York, Aurelien Breeden from Paris.

That's when Apple, a year after launching the iPhone, introduced its App Store to the world. The online marketplace launched with 500 apps, mostly for established Web companies such as Facebook, eBay and Yelp. Today, it has more than 850,000. And, a couple of months ago, it passed a mind-boggling threshold, marking the 50 billionth app to be downloaded. Apple can no longer claim proprietary ownership of apps, those mini-programs that continue to push the boundaries of what a mobile phone can do. Google launched its own app store, now called Play, less than a year after Apple. Today, it's on a path toward surpassing Apple's number of downloads. But the iPhone was the first smartphone most folks ever saw, and the App Store was the accessory that gave it extra usefulness. On this anniversary, we look at five iconic apps that got a huge lift from the App Store and expanded the capabilities of our phones. 'Angry Birds' Before the App Store, video games were, by and large, for hard-core players with consoles or souped-up PCs. Now the line between who is a gamer and who's not is blurry -- and millions of people have \\"Angry Birds\\" to thank. The deceptively addictive little game, in which players fling a flock of ... well ... angry birds at their pig nemeses, is the top-selling paid app in the App Store's history. Since its launch in 2009, the game has become a franchise, with spinoffs, toys, cartoons and even a movie making up just part of Finnish developer Rovio Entertainment's furious, feathered empire. Addicted gamers are sweet on 'Candy Crush' Google Maps. With the rise of Google's Android system as Apple's chief mobile rival, there's a certain irony that one of its products was a key to the App Store's success. But since Google Maps rolled out as a native app for the iPhone, the ability to get directions on the go has become one of mobile computing's key features. (Does anyone still hand-draw maps?) Yes, there are other map apps out there. But Google's treasure-trove of data makes its maps a go-to for millions. Witness the mini-disaster Apple had on its hands when it bumped Google's offering for its own Maps app last year. Apple's product was so half-baked that CEO Tim Cook, in a rare mea culpa, essentially told users to download Google Maps until it was fixed. How to kickstart your holiday using apps not maps. Pandora. By 2008 Pandora already had become a popular Web-streaming service, letting users seed their own personal radio stations with bands or songs they liked. But the company was quick to see the potential in mobile computing, and Pandora was among the first apps available when the App Store went live. Since then, it's become the second-most downloaded iPhone app in the store's history, trailing only Facebook. Its proof of concept -- that users want to be able to bring their music with them anywhere -- also helped inspire a host of competitors, from Spotify to Rdio to Last.fm. Why everybody's building a Web music service. Instagram. Mobile phones, particularly smartphones, made all of us photographers. That's a huge shift. But, sadly for most of us, it didn't make us all good photographers. Enter Instagram -- with a slate of editing tools and funky filters that can make even the most pedestrian pictures look good. Add to that Instagram's social features, complete with Twitter-like hashtags, and you've got a tool tailor-made for mobile. Launched in 2010 by Stanford University students, Instagram now moves about 45 million images every day. Oh ... and those creators also sold it to Facebook last year for a cool 1 billion. Instagram launches 15-second video feature. Shazam. It seems like a little thing, until you stop and think about it: What if your phone could listen to a few seconds of a song, then tell you what it is? That would have sounded like magic not so many years ago. Now, we take it for granted. Shazam started in the UK in 2002 as a Web service. But it was front and center at the beginning of the mobile revolution, and is now among Apple's Top 10 downloaded apps, with 350 million users. 20 fun and useful new mobile apps.

These accessory proteins are proposed to be involved in metallocenter assembly (M. H. Lee, S. B. Mulrooney, M. J. Renner, Y. Markowicz, and R. P. Hausinger, J. Bacteriol. 174:4324-4330, 1992). A series of three UreD-urease apoprotein complexes are present in cells that express ureD at high levels, and these complexes are thought to be essential for in vivo activation of the enzyme (I.-S. Park, M. B. Carr, and R. P. Hausinger, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3233-3237, 1994). In this study, we describe the effect of accessory gene deletions on urease complex formation. The ureE, ureF, and ureG gene products were found not to be required for formation of the UreD-urease complexes; however, the complexes from the ureF deletion mutant exhibited delayed elution during size exclusion chromatography. Because these last complexes were of typical UreD-urease sizes according to native gel electrophoretic analysis, we propose that UreF alters the conformation of the UreD-urease complexes. The same studies revealed the presence of an additional series of urease apoprotein complexes present only in cells containing ureD, ureF, and ureG, along with the urease subunit genes. These new complexes were shown to contain urease, UreD, UreF, and UreG. We propose that the UreD-UreF-UreG-urease apoprotein complexes represent the activation-competent form of urease apoprotein in the cell..

How Entrepreneurs Are Using the Sharing Economy to Boost Business For six years, Harry Campbell had a good gig as an aerospace engineer for Boeing ba . His job at the Fortune 500 company offered structure, stability, and predictability. But Campbell, 29, was looking for flexible work hours and creative ways to diversify his income. So in 2014 he turned to Uber and began driving for the ridesharing service part-time. He quickly found that being an Uber driver involved more than just taking passengers from point A to point B. “Some drivers treat it as a really casual part-time gig, but what you’re really doing is running your own business,” he says. “You have to think about how much money you’re making in addition to expenses, insurance, liability and taxes.” After driving for a few months, he decided to launch a blog and podcast called The Rideshare Guy to help other drivers run their businesses effectively. While that’s become a full-time endeavor, Campbell still finds time to participate in the on-demand economy: in addition to Uber, he works for ridesharing company Lyft, delivery service Postmates and restaurant delivery startup DoorDash. Campbell is part of a growing demographic of business owners who choose to partake in the sharing economy. Intuit recently conducted a study surveying more than 4,600 on-demand economy workers and found that 39% own their own businesses and 32% want to be their own boss. “We see workers having three different sources of income just to maintain a standard of living,” says Alex Chriss, general manager of Intuit’s intu self-employed solutions small–business unit. The study cites work flexibility, control and autonomy as workers’ primary incentives, but there are some surprising benefits that explain why more and more entrepreneurs are drawn to the perks of the on-demand economy. For one, there’s the social aspect. “The hardest thing for me when I left my engineering job was not even the money or the risk, it was really just leaving all my friends and co-workers,” Campbell says. Getting out of the house to drive strangers around has helped — and it seems to have worked both ways. “I’ve had passengers really open up to me,” he says. “A lot of drivers joke that we’re actually therapists.” Related: Meet the Secretive Startup Trying to Steal Uber’s Top Drivers Dar Sandler, 33, who drove for Uber while working on his fintech startup describes himself as “a super social person who will talk to anyone.” He primarily used Uber to supplement his income, sometimes making 50 to 60 an hour when he worked during Boston’s record snowstorms, but it was the human interaction he valued most. “It’s a great way to network, especially if you’re in Boston or New York where you’re driving people with a little bit more wealth and status,” he says. “Although the irony is that a lot of times they view you as just a driver.” He remembers picking up a passenger who worked in consulting. The passenger began explaining his job, assuming Sandler wasn’t familiar with the industry terminology. “When we started having an intelligent conversation, he was like ‘Oh, this guy really knows his shit,’” he says. “And then they wonder, ‘Why are you driving for Uber?’” Related: 5 Things to Know About How the Feds See the ‘Sharing’ Economy Taking a job in the gig economy also lets entrepreneurs dabble in experiences that can inspire them without a ton of investment. Arianna Spiros, 25, recently launched a jewelry business, Kalí Zoë Designs. While she was developing the idea, she spent time working as a yoga instructor on sailboats through FindACrew, a platform that connects boat owners with a crew. “I tutored students while laying the framework of my business because I’m inspired by traveling and living outdoors,” she says. “It wasn’t directly jewelry-related, but it was a fun way to explore and learn.” Spiros has found that many people in the on-demand economy share a similar entrepreneurial spirit. For instance, when she moved to Chicago without a car, she used Uber as her main form of transportation. One of the drivers, who is an aspiring entrepreneur in the music industry, agreed to do the music for her company’s promotional video. In return, she helped him with logistics in creating music for yoga classes and yoga festivals. “I have a lot of interests, and I’m lucky that some of these passions give me the opportunity to make money,” Spiros says. “I’d rather grow them into my own career than do something solely for money. I really value my freedom.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses how entrepreneurs are leveraging the sharing economy to boost their businesses.

Given the background: Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth. and the situation: Robert, a baker, has just baked a large batch of cupcakes for his store. He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer. Answer the following question: Which temperature will result in slower growth of micro-organisms on the cupcakes?","completion":"The temperature that will result in slower growth of micro-organisms on Robert's cupcakes is 0° F. There are two primary factors to consider when determining the optimal temperature for food preservation through freezing: 1. The effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates: Lower temperatures slow down chemical and enzymatic reactions that contribute to food spoilage. The rate of these reactions generally decreases as the temperature is reduced. Thus, by storing the cupcakes at 0° F, the rate of spoilage will be lower than at 10° F. 2. The effect of freezing on water availability for bacterial growth: Freezing affects the water molecules' ability to move and interact with other molecules, thus decreasing the rate at which bacteria can access water for their growth and proliferation. When water freezes, it forms ice crystals, which prevents the water from being available to bacteria. Moreover, the colder the temperature, the more ice crystals are formed, which further limits the available water for bacterial growth. In comparing the two temperatures, 0° F provides a more effective method for preserving the cupcakes' freshness because of the enhanced impact of lower temperatures on reaction rates and reduced water availability. The 0° F temperature will cause the water within the cupcakes to freeze more rapidly, reducing the amount of available water for micro-organisms and slowing down chemical reactions that can lead to food spoilage and decay. In conclusion, Robert should store his unsold cupcakes at 0° F in the freezer. This lower temperature will provide him with a greater level of protection against food spoilage and bacterial growth, ensuring that the cupcakes can be preserved for a longer period with minimal quality loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The home was badly damaged but the residents escaped unharmed. Firefighter manager Lee Coleman, of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said the family awoke to see flames lapping at the front door. \\"There was no way they could have got out of that house through the front door and so they made their exit through the bedroom window of the first floor,\\" he said.

As these hearings are pivotal in determining her fitness for serving on the nation's highest court, Sotomayor will need to rely on her skills, legal knowledge, and years of experience to answer these questions convincingly and genuinely. Emma Coleman Jordan's statement regarding the majority of Sotomayor's 350 judicial opinions being uncontroversial should aid in the overall perception of her qualifications for the role. In the weeks leading up to the confirmation hearings, Sotomayor will have to prepare diligently by studying her previous rulings, examining legal precedents, and anticipating the line of questioning that the Senate is likely to take. She will need to be ready to defend her judicial philosophy, provide her perspective on important constitutional questions, and address any potential concerns that may be raised.

The subject in this case is \\"The action\\" and the verb phrase is \\"came just one day before Nuland, on a regional tour, arrived in Skopje to deliver a call for more reforms.\\" It indicates that the event (i.e., the action) occurred one day before Nuland (probably a high-ranking official or diplomat) arrived in Skopje (the capital city of North Macedonia) as part of a regional tour. The purpose of the visit was presumably to advocate for more reforms. 2) With the structure and meaning of the sentence understood, I can now proceed with the translation into Romanian. The translated sentence is: \\"Acțiunea a avut loc cu o zi înainte ca Nuland, într-un tur regional, să ajungă la Skopje pentru a solicita mai multe reforme.\\" 3) Now I will explain briefly the choices I made during the translation: In Romanian, the structure of the sentence is a bit different compared to English. For instance, the verb \\"a avut loc\\" (took place) is used to refer to events or actions happening, same as the English counterpart \\"came\\". The phrase \\"cu o zi înainte\\" stands for \\"just one day before\\". The term \\"într-un tur regional\\" corresponds to \\"on a regional tour\\". Similarly, \\"să ajungă la\\" represents \\"arrived in\\", and \\"pentru a solicita mai multe reforme\\" stands for \\"to deliver a call for more reforms\\".

Eric Garner, a father of six children and grandfather to two, weighed 400lb and suffered from asthma, which played a crucial role in the tragic events that unfolded. Cellphone footage taken from a bystander revealed the heartbreaking moments as Garner repeatedly shouted \\"I can't breathe\\" while officers pinned him to the ground during an attempted arrest. The video shows Mr. Garner appearing to lose consciousness as a result of the forceful restraint. He was quickly taken to Richmond Medical Center, where he later died following a cardiac arrest. The circumstances surrounding Eric Garner's tragic death have led to public uproar demanding justice and accountability. In response to the growing concerns, Mayor Bill de Blasio has promised a thorough investigation into this tragic event. As family, friends, and the community mourn the loss of Garner, the investigation will aim to address any wrongdoings and shed light on any possible factors that contributed to this untimely death. With nationwide attention focused on this case, changes in law enforcement practices may also be brought into question. Eric Garner's tragic passing leaves behind a grieving wife, six children, and two grandchildren. His death serves as a reminder that addressing the use of force by law enforcement officers and fostering better relationships between communities and authorities must remain a priority. The resolution of the case and Mayor de Blasio's commitment to an impartial investigation can serve as crucial steps in healing the societal wounds caused by instances of excessive force and rebuilding trust between civilians and law enforcement.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"While it is not recommended to make a \\"drinkable\\" room spray, as room sprays are often composed of ingredients not safe for consumption, you can create an aromatic and versatile spray using all-natural ingredients that can be used as a room freshener and, if desired, added into beverages in small quantities. Here's a detailed guide on creating an all-natural, non-toxic, and multi-purpose aromatic spray: Ingredients: 1. Distilled water (8 ounces) 2. Witch hazel (2 ounces) 3. Pure, food-grade essential oils (10-20 drops, depending on your preference) Instructions: 1. Choose safe food-grade essential oils: Begin by selecting pure, food-grade essential oils made from organic sources. This is important because not all essential oils are safe for consumption, and you want to ensure their quality. Some popular food-grade essential oils include lavender, peppermint, citrus oils (e.g., lemon, orange, bergamot), and herbs (e.g., rosemary, basil, lemongrass). 2. Prepare the spray bottle: Find a clean, dark glass spray bottle to store your homemade spray. Dark glass will help protect the essential oils from direct sunlight and prevent degradation over time. 3. Mix the ingredients: Pour two ounces of witch hazel into the spray bottle. Witch hazel is a natural preservative and can help extend the shelf life of your spray while also blending it properly with essential oils. Next, add 10-20 drops of your chosen food-grade essential oils. The exact number of drops will depend on the intensity of the fragrance you desire. You can mix and match various essential oils to create unique scents or stick to your favorite single scent. Lastly, pour eight ounces of distilled water into the spray bottle, filling the bottle almost to the top. Leave a small gap to facilitate shaking the solution later. 4. Shake the mixture: Secure the spray bottle's top, and shake the mixture vigorously to ensure that the witch hazel, essential oils, and distilled water are blended evenly. 5. Use the spray: Your homemade natural aromatic spray is now ready for use. Shake the bottle before each use to ensure the ingredients are well-blended. Spray the solution in living spaces, bedrooms, and bathrooms to refresh the air. Since you used food-grade essential oils, you can also add a drop or two of the scented water to beverages if you wish. However, keep in mind that using too much at once might overpower the taste of your drink and may not be safe. Remember, moderation is key when it comes to using this multi-purpose spray in beverages. Always be cautious, and consult a professional or reliable source if you have any concerns about adding essential oils to your drinks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

But the quake that struck Sunday, centered about 6 miles southwest of Napa, wasn't on that line. \\"I don't think we can make any connection on that,\\" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. \\"This is on a different fault -- still part of the same system, still the plates are still shifting from California, the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate.\\" The","completion":"recent earthquake in the Bay Area has certainly shaken the nerves of many residents and brought attention to the ever-looming threat of a massive, potentially devastating seismic event. However, while this recent tremor was significant, it is not necessarily indicative of an increase in overall seismic activity. Earthquakes are natural occurrences that result from the movement of tectonic plates along fault lines. These movements release energy that travels through the Earth's crust, causing the shaking and vibrations experienced during an earthquake. The frequency of earthquakes is influenced by many factors, including the rate of plate movement, geological processes, and even human activities like mining and reservoir impoundment. It is essential to note that the recent Bay Area earthquake occurred on a different fault line than the notorious San Andreas Fault, which is responsible for some of California's most catastrophic earthquakes in the past. The San Andreas Fault is indeed expected to produce a significant quake at some point in the future, but predicting the exact timing of such an event remains impossible with current scientific knowledge. In summary, while the recent earthquake in northern California has raised concerns about the potential for an increase in global seismic activity and the possible occurrence of the \\"Big One,\\" experts maintain that this event does not necessarily indicate a surge in earthquakes around the world or a harbinger of imminent catastrophe. As always, it is crucial for residents in earthquake-prone regions to remain vigilant and prepared for the unpredictable nature of these seismic events."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, Brazil's population growth rate has dropped greatly and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average. This achievement really becomes the envy of many other Third World countries. Brazil has become one of the developing world's great successes at reducing population growth-----but more by accident than design. While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had a better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard. Martine _ , among other things, soap operas(TV series) and installment plans introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, although indirect role in lowering the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of soap operas. Globo, Brazil's most popular television network, shows three hours of soaps six nights a week, while three others show at least one hour a night. Most TV series are based on wealthy characters living the high life in big cities. \\"Although they have never really tried to work in a message towards the problems of reproduction , they describe middle and upper class values-----not many children, different attitudes towards sex, women working,\\" says Martine. \\"They sent this image to all parts of Brazil and made people conscious of other patterns of behavior and other values, which were put into a very attractive package.\\" Meanwhile, the installment plans tried to encourage the poor to become consumers. \\"This led to an enormous change in consumption patterns and showed that consumption was in contradiction with unlimited reproduction,\\" says Martine.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I read this background article the other day: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. I am facing a new situation today: Two plants of the same type are growing near the outskirts of the Jorah forest. The first plant, colored red, is healthy and has no fungus on it. The other plant, colored black, has a fungus growing on the roots of it. These plants have been around for centuries and if crushed into a powder actually make a nice seasoning to add to a meal. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which color plant is sharing access to its glucose?","completion":"Based on the information from the background article on mycorrhizal associations, it can be inferred that the black-colored plant with a fungus growing on its roots is the one sharing access to its glucose. This is because mycorrhizal associations involve a symbiotic relationship between the plant and the fungus, where the plant provides the fungus with glucose, and the fungus helps the plant with increased water and nutrient absorption. In this situation, the black plant has a mycorrhizal association and would be the one sharing its glucose with the fungus.

Please answer this question: Which term has come into use for musicals based on a catalogue of previously released songs?","completion":"The term that has come into use for musicals based on a catalogue of previously released songs is \\"jukebox musical.\\" Jukebox musicals are a subgenre of musical theater where the story is either built around or inspired by a collection of pre-existing songs, rather than having an original score specifically composed for the show. These musicals often pay tribute to a specific musical artist, genre, or era and utilize their songs to propel the narrative, create a particular mood, or evoke memories associated with the music. The concept of jukebox musicals evolved from the mid-20th century practice of including hit songs from popular music charts in stage productions and movies. The term itself is derived from the jukebox, a coin-operated machine that plays selected recorded music when a specific song is chosen from its catalogue. Jukebox musicals mirror this idea by weaving together popular songs to tell a story or celebrate a specific style of music. The popularity of jukebox musicals has grown significantly since the late 1990s and early 2000s, with several groundbreaking productions achieving worldwide success. Some notable examples of jukebox musicals include: 1. Mamma Mia! (1999) - Based on the music of the Swedish pop group ABBA, Mamma Mia! is one of the most successful jukebox musicals of all time, with its story revolving around a young girl trying to uncover the identity of her father before her wedding day. 2. Jersey Boys (2005) - Featuring the music of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, Jersey Boys tells the story of the band's formation, rise to fame, and eventual disbandment. The show has garnered numerous awards and critical acclaim for its representation of the iconic group's musical journey. 3. We Will Rock You (2002) - Based on the songs of British rock band Queen, We Will Rock You is set in a dystopian future where music is heavily controlled by a powerful corporation. The story follows a group of rebels who try to bring back the essence of rock music and break free from the oppressive regime. 4. Beautiful: The Carole King Musical (2013) - This biographical musical tells the story of American singer-songwriter Carole King, following her career from her early beginnings as a songwriter to her rise as a successful solo artist. The show features several of King's notable hits, showcasing her immense impact on the music industry. 5. Ain't Too Proud (2018) - Based on the life and music of The Temptations, Ain't Too Proud highlights the group's career, from their formation in the 1960s to the present day. The show delves into the struggles, triumphs, and interpersonal relationships between the members while highlighting their hit songs throughout the years. Jukebox musicals have gained popularity with audiences for their nostalgic value and the familiarity of their music. Despite occasional criticism for their reliance on pre-existing material, these musicals continue to captivate theatergoers and provide an entertaining showcase for the timeless music that has shaped and defined generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:A team at Duke University used a system known as CRISPR-Cas9 to delete DNA that was preventing cells from producing a protein essential for muscle function. And a virus was used to deliver DNA alterations into the cells of mice. Writing in the journal Science, the team say when they injected the therapy direct into the legs of adult mice, it resulted in improved muscle strength. When they injected it into the bloodstream - tests showed improvements in muscles responsible for heart and lung function. Chris Nelson, who led the research, said: \\"A major hurdle for gene editing is delivery. \\"We know what genes need to be fixed for certain diseases, but getting the gene editing tools where they need to go is a huge challenge. \\"The best way we have to do it right now is to take advantage of viruses, because they have spent billions of years evolving to figure out how to get their own viral genes into cells.\\" CRISPR-Cas9 is a simple, fast and inexpensive gene editing system discovered three years ago, which is now being used by laboratories all over the world. It combines sections of synthetic DNA - CRISPRs - with a protein known as Cas9. Rather like a sat nav, Crispr scans the genome looking for the right location and then uses the Cas9 protein as molecular scissors to snip through the DNA. DMD is a genetic disease that gradually causes weakness and loss of muscle function. Humans with the condition lack normal dystrophin, a protein found in muscles, which helps to protect muscles from injury. In patients with the disease, the muscles become damaged and eventually stop working. The inherited disease usually affects only boys - about a 100 babies a year in the UK are affected. Few of those affected live beyond their early 30s. Although this research was in mice, it has raised hopes of a treatment for humans at some point in the future. Prof Peter Braude, emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynaecology from King's College London, said: \\"This is an exciting paper demonstrating in laboratory mice the feasibility of a non-controversial use of the new CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to treat a serious and slowly lethal genetic disease.\\" Prof Adrian Thrasher, from the Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital, described it as an \\"important study demonstrating proof of principle of gene editing in vivo for neuromuscular disease, but still some way to go before translatable to human subjects.\\" In a second study, also in Science, a team at Harvard University used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in egg and sperm cells of mice carrying DMD. Eighty per cent of baby mice born following germline modification showed successful DNA editing. Germline alterations - changes to the DNA that are passed down the generations - is a more controversial use of gene editing. It raises ethical issues, as the technology could in theory be used to produce \\"designer\\" humans, with embryos being tweaked to enhance their physical or mental abilities. Others argue it could be a vital tool for curing serious genetic conditions like DMD, Huntington's Disease or Cystic Fibrosis. The team at Harvard also used gene editing to treat DMD-affected mice a few days after birth via injections into the abdomen, muscles or the back of the eye, with each method improving muscle function.

However, it's worth noting that despite these phenomenal economic and technological advancements, wealth distribution worldwide did not occur uniformly. The divide between the rich and the poor grew wider. The majority of the global population remained situated on the poorer side of this divide. Therefore, while the 20th century saw remarkable growth in terms of per-capita GDP and advancements in key sectors like medicine and communications, it also resulted in increased income inequality globally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Who recommends using serum? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. Selina B. Beautystorm.com C.

This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. and the situation: The ecologist moved from Aspen, where there was no air pollution, to Seattle which experienced a lot of air pollution. He started studying the weather there as well. Answer the following question: Which city didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life? A:","completion":"The city that didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life is Aspen. This is because Aspen is mentioned to have no air pollution, which means that it does not have acid rain. Acid rain, caused by air pollution, is detrimental to the environment, particularly wildlife, insects, and aquatic life. In contrast, Seattle, which experiences a lot of air pollution, is more likely to have acid rain that can potentially harm or kill aquatic life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: After initially stating that Adrian Peterson would return to the active roster for their Week 3 game at New Orleans, the Vikings later placed the running back on the inactive list indefinitely, pending the outcome of the court case against him. Despite coming into the game at 0-3, the Saints started well, scoring two touchdowns on their first two drives, although DE Everson Griffen was able to block the extra point attempt on the second. The Vikings responded to going 13-0 down with two field goals from 25 and 30 yards respectively, but an injury to Matt Cassel meant a debut for rookie QB Teddy Bridgewater. K Blair Walsh hit a 40-yard field goal to open the second half for the Vikings, but New Orleans closed the game out with an 18-yard touchdown pass from Drew Brees to Marques Colston early in the fourth quarter. They were aided on the drive by a penalty for unnecessary roughness against CB Captain Munnerlyn for a tackle on Brees, but many thought that Brees should also have been penalized for his reaction and the penalties offset. Regardless, the Vikings were forced to punt on their next possession and the Saints were able to run out the clock for a 20-9 win. Question: How many points did the Saints win by?

Erdogan poartă discuţii cu preşedintele Armeniei la Washington. Translate to English","completion":"Turkish President Erdogan holds talks with the Armenian President in Washington. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is holding discussions with the President of Armenia in Washington. This meeting exemplifies the diplomatic engagement between the two countries, which have had a historically strained relationship due to various political and historical issues. The talks between Erdogan and the Armenian President are aimed at improving bilateral relations, fostering cooperation in various fields, and promoting regional peace and stability. While both countries are aware of the challenges presented by their complex history, the talks signify a willingness to work through these issues and pave the way for better relations. Several points of discussion are likely to be addressed during this meeting, such as the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, economic cooperation, and trade. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is a territorial dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which has previously had implications for Turkey, due to Turkey's close ties with Azerbaijan. In these talks, both the Turkish and Armenian sides may express their views on how to resolve the conflict peacefully and ensure stability in the region. Economic cooperation and trade are also essential topics for the two countries, as they are exploring ways to enhance their economic ties in a bid to benefit both nations. Encouraging trade and investment, and identifying areas of potential collaboration, could strengthen their economic partnership and lead to mutual gains. Additionally, there may be discussions surrounding the historical issue of the Armenian Genocide. The Armenian Genocide was perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire during World War I when around 1.5 million Armenians were killed. While Turkey has not officially recognized the event as genocide, it remains a significant political and historical concern between Armenia and Turkey. Open dialogue and understanding on the matter could help alleviate the tensions. Turkey and Armenia may also discuss cooperation in areas such as energy, infrastructure development, and cultural exchange. Developing collaborative projects in these spheres can contribute to building trust and understanding between the two nations, fostering a more positive relationship. In conclusion, the meeting between Turkish President Erdogan and the Armenian President in Washington demonstrates their commitment to engaging in productive dialogue and working towards improved bilateral relations. By addressing various issues, including the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, economic cooperation, trade, and historical concerns like the Armenian Genocide, this diplomatic engagement seeks to foster regional peace and stability, as well as strengthen ties between Turkey and Armenia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: who is the little girl in when a man loves a woman?","completion":"In the 1994 film \\"When a Man Loves a Woman,\\" the little girl is Jessica, portrayed by actress Mae Whitman. The movie, directed by Luis Mandoki, is an emotional drama that focuses on the relationship of Alice Green (played by Meg Ryan) and her husband Michael Green (played by Andy Garcia) as they navigate Alice's struggles with alcoholism and its impact on their family. Jessica is the older daughter of Alice and Michael and has a younger sister named Casey (played by Tina Majorino). Throughout the story, Jessica is depicted as being affected by her mother's addiction and the turmoil it brings upon their family, including Alice's rehabilitation stint and Michael's attempts to hold everything together. Jessica's experiences reflect the challenges faced by children in families dealing with substance abuse, such as fear, abandonment, emotional pain, and fractured relationships. Mae Whitman's portrayal of Jessica in \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" was well-received by critics and audiences, demonstrating her ability to convey a range of emotions as a young actress. This role was one of Mae's earliest, but she went on to have a successful career in both film and television, known for her work in projects such as \\"Hope Floats,\\" \\"One Fine Day,\\" \\"Independence Day,\\" \\"Parenthood,\\" and \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower.\\" \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" delivers a realistic portrayal of alcoholism, recovery, and the impact it has on family dynamics, exploring how addiction affects not just the individual but also their loved ones.

Unless it affects them directly , or its rubbed in their faces ( like the plight of unborn fetuses - whom they care so desperately about - until they are born , that is ) , they do n't care . Who is the narrator likely to vote for on the first Tuesday in November 2020 ?","completion":"Based on the provided text, the narrator is highly critical of the Republican party and expresses strong disapproval of their perceived lack of concern for certain issues. They specifically mention that Republicans do not seem to care about others' plights unless it affects them directly or is extremely prominent, such as with unborn fetuses. As the narrator is clearly dissatisfied with the Republican party and shows no affinity or support for it, it is highly unlikely that they would choose to vote for Republican candidates on the first Tuesday in November 2020. This date is significant in the United States as it is the usual day for the presidential election, along with other various state and local elections. Since the other major political party in the United States is the Democratic party, it is relatively more likely that the narrator would choose to vote for Democratic candidates. Although the provided text does not explicitly mention support for the Democratic party, the political context often features a two-party system, resulting in voters primarily choosing between Republican or Democratic candidates. Moreover, other possibilities might be that the narrator could vote for a third-party or independent candidate to voice their frustration with the main political parties. Alternatively, they could choose not to participate in the electoral process altogether by abstaining from voting, which might indicate their dissatisfaction with the two-party system and the options provided. In conclusion, while the narrator's preference is not explicitly stated, it is most likely that they would vote for the Democratic party or a third-party/independent candidate on the first Tuesday in November 2020, due to their critical stance on the Republican party and the assumption that they are still engaging in the voting process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, his fortune comes with a condition: he must spend 30 million within 30 days and have nothing to show for it. If Hank fails, he loses the remaining 90 million. As Hank embarks on an unimaginable spending spree, he learns about the true value of money, friendship, and love. Plot: Opening with the sudden death of wealthy entrepreneur James Brewster in a car accident, Hank Brewster is informed about the unexpected multi-million-dollar inheritance that is to come his way. The eccentric James had left a will that stated his heir could only receive the remaining fortune if they could understand the worth of money by spending 30 million dollars in a month. Hank, an honest and hardworking small-town mechanic, initially assumes it's a ridiculous prank. However, when an official lawyer, Sarah Thompson, presents the legal documents, he realizes the great challenge ahead. Hank initially believes the task to be easy and indulges in luxurious items such as sports cars, a mansion, tailored suits, and lavish parties. With the help of his best friend, Mike, Hank receives assistance in managing his newfound wealth, which only prompts him into making extravagant and impulsive decisions. As news of his wealth and outrageous lifestyle spread, Hank starts attracting a motley crew of sycophants and gold-diggers, who become increasingly drawn to the frivolous millionaire. Among them is the cunning entrepreneur, Vincent Walker, who attempts to exploit Hank's wealth and naivety to invest in his shady business ventures. Sarah Thompson, the lawyer assigned to oversee Hank's execution of the will, becomes his voice of reason during his spending journey. However, Hank becomes more and more extravagant in his spending, betting on horse races, chartering private jets, and renovating his mansion. He even sponsors a daring albino-penguin expedition leading to Antarctica, which turns out to be a hoax concocted by Vincent. As the deadline approaches, Hank is dangerously close to failing his challenge; he still has around 2 million left to spend. Desperate, he organizes a city-wide scavenger hunt with the remaining money, offering that amount as the grand prize. Thousands of people participate in the event, and the entire city is involved in a mad frenzy. Along the way, Hank realizes he has fallen in love with Sarah, who reciprocates his feelings despite her initial reservations. Hank also discovers Vincent's deception and exposes him, protecting unsuspecting citizens from getting tangled in a web of fraud. In the final hours, Hank realizes that his material possessions and lavish lifestyle do not bring him true happiness. In the nick of time, the scavenger hunt's grand prize is claimed, and Hank fulfills the will's requirements. By truly understanding the true value of a dollar and the importance of strong relationships and morality, Hank wins the remaining inheritance. Upon receiving the rest of the fortune, Hank chooses to invest in the betterment of his small town, providing for a new hospital, a community center, and an education center for skill development. The film ends with Hank and Sarah announcing their engagement, and Mike— who had been offered a profitable position in Vincent's company— chooses loyalty and returns to working alongside Hank in the family mechanic shop.

Their best known line-up consisted of lead vocalist Brian Connolly, bass player Steve Priest, guitarist Andy Scott, and drummer Mick Tucker. The group was originally called Sweetshop. The band was formed in London in 1968 and achieved their first hit, \\"Funny Funny\\", in 1971 after teaming up with songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman and record producer Phil Wainman. Guitarist Mick Stewart joined in 1969. Stewart had some rock pedigree, having previously worked with The (Ealing) Redcaps and Simon Scott & The All-Nite Workers in the mid-1960s. In late 1965, that band became The Phil Wainman Set when the future Sweet producer joined on drums and the group cut some singles with Errol Dixon. In early 1966, Stewart left and later worked with Johnny Kidd & The Pirates. The Sweet signed a new record contract with EMI's Parlophone label. Three bubblegum pop singles were released: \\"Lollipop Man\\" (September 1969), \\"All You'll Ever Get from Me\\" (January 1970), and a cover version of the Archies' \\"Get on the Line\\" (June 1970), all of which failed to chart. Stewart then quit, and was not replaced for some time. Connolly and Tucker had a chance meeting with Wainman, who was now producing, and knew of two aspiring songwriters, Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, who were looking for a group to sing over some demos they had written together. Connolly, Priest and Tucker provided the vocals on a track called \\"Funny Funny\\" which featured Pip Williams on guitar, John Roberts on bass and Wainman on drums. The latter began offering the track to various recording companies. The band held auditions for a replacement guitarist and settled on Welsh-born Andy Scott. He had most recently been playing with Mike McCartney (brother of Paul) in the Scaffold. As a member of the Elastic Band, he had played guitar on two singles for Decca, \\"Think of You Baby\\" and \\"Do Unto Others\\". He also appeared on the band's lone album release, Expansions on Life, and on some recordings by the Scaffold. The band rehearsed for a number of weeks before Scott made his live debut with Sweet on 26 September 1970 at the Windsor Ballroom in Redcar. The Sweet initially attempted to combine various musical influences, including the Monkees and 1960s bubblegum pop groups such as the Archies, with more heavy rock-oriented groups such as the Who. The Sweet adopted the rich vocal harmony style of the Hollies, with distorted guitars and a heavy rhythm section. This fusion of pop and hard rock would remain a central trademark of Sweet's music and prefigured the glam metal of a few years later. The Sweet's initial album appearance was on the budget label Music for Pleasure as part of a compilation called Gimme Dat Ding, released in December 1970. The Sweet had one side of the record; the Pipkins (whose sole hit, \\"Gimme Dat Ding\\", gave the LP its name) had the other. The Sweet side consisted of the A- and B-sides of the band's three Parlophone singles. Andy Scott appears in the album cover shot, even though he did not play on any of the recordings.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Were these well received?","completion":"The three bubblegum pop singles, \\"Lollipop Man\\" (September 1969), \\"All You'll Ever Get from Me\\" (January 1970), and a cover version of the Archies' \\"Get on the Line\\" (June 1970), were not well received, as they \\"failed to chart.\\""},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The concept was far more common in the early days of football, when pro teams used their best athletes as many ways as possible, and substitutions were far more restricted, meaning players had to stay on the field for offense, defense and \`\`special teams''. This was known as the one-platoon system. Available options: - no. - yes. Is this statement correct \\"can you play 2 positions in the nfl\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"can you play 2 positions in the NFL?\\" is correct. In the NFL and other levels of gridiron football, it is possible for players to play multiple positions. This is especially true for utility players, who have the skills and athletic ability to adapt to different roles on the field. Utility players are valuable assets to a team because of their versatility and ability to fill in at different positions when needed. The emergence of versatile players has continued to evolve since the early days of football when the one-platoon system was in place. During that period, players had to stay on the field for offense, defense, and special teams, forcing them to be proficient in more than one position. Although the NFL has largely moved away from the one-platoon system, there are still players in today's game who can be utilized in various positions. Some examples include: 1. Taysom Hill (New Orleans Saints) - Primarily a quarterback, Hill has also been utilized as a tight end, wide receiver, and special teams contributor. 2. Jabrill Peppers (New York Giants) - Drafted as a safety, Peppers has also played linebacker and served as a kick returner on special teams. 3. Ty Montgomery (New Orleans Saints) - Originally a wide receiver, Montgomery transitioned to running back and has also contributed on special teams as a kick returner. 4. Troy Brown (New England Patriots) - A wide receiver for most of his career, Brown stepped in as a defensive back during the Patriots' 2004 Super Bowl run and continued to play both positions throughout the remainder of his career. Some players may make position changes early in their careers and stick with their new roles permanently due to team needs or if their abilities are better suited to a different position. Others may switch between different roles on a game-by-game or even play-by-play basis, depending on game situations and coaching strategies. In summary, the statement \\"can you play 2 positions in the NFL?\\" is correct, as there are versatile utility players who have proven capable of playing multiple positions in the league. While less common than in the early days of football, athletes with the ability to fill various roles continue to greatly contribute to their teams' success by providing depth and flexibility."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Mike Pence emerges as Trump’s likely running mate CLEVELAND – Indiana Gov. Mike Pence emerged Thursday as Donald Trump’s likely running mate, with allies of Pence and Trump sending increasingly strong signals that Pence would join the GOP ticket and Republican leaders saying they have been told to stand by for an announcement. But less than 24 hours before Trump was set to reveal his vice-presidential choice at an event in New York, Trump had not made a formal offer, according Republicans familiar with the discussions who spoke mid-afternoon Thursday on the condition of anonymity because the ongoing talks were confidential. Indiana Governor Mike Pence (R) is on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's short list of potential vice presidential candidates. Here's what you need to know about him. (Peter Stevenson,Danielle Kunitz,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) The GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, traveling in California for a series of fundraisers, continued Thursday to solicit advice from his family and aides -- and held off, at least into the afternoon, on notifying Pence or any other potential pick of a decision, these Republicans said. In Indiana, meanwhile, Pence gave an economic speech and then waited with his family and advisers for word from Trump. Associates of Trump said he has been torn between his gut instincts to tap a fiery combatant or heeding the advice of his advisers to tap the relatively low-key and low-profile Pence, whose elevation to the ticket could help unify the divided Republican Party. Causing further hesitation was Trump's lack of a close personal bond with Pence, whom he has only gotten to know in recent months. Trump's adult children, as well as son-in-law Jared Kushner, have played an influential role guiding Trump's deliberations and gave him differing advice. Donald Trump Jr., the candidate's eldest son, and Kushner have advocated for former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.), even though Trump's political advisers prefer Pence, according to people close to the family. Trump’s advisers cautioned on Thursday afternoon that the selection process remained fluid, and Republicans familiar with the celebrity mogul candidate's deliberations said that he could spring a surprise. Trump campaign officials, who are working here in Cleveland ahead of next week’s Republican National Convention, said reports that Trump has selected Pence were premature. They did not dispute that Pence would join the ticket, but said that no decision has been formalized. By mid-afternoon, two senior campaign officials said Trump had not yet called Pence to offer him the job or reached out to any other vice-presidential hopeful. A third official, spokesman Jason Miller, tweeted, \\"A decision has not been made by Mr. Trump.\\" 1/2 A decision has not been made by Mr. Trump. He will be making a decision in the future… — Jason Miller (@JasonMillerinDC) July 14, 2016 Trump is scheduled to make his first joint appearance with his running mate on Friday at the Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan. Should he join forces with Trump, Pence, a deeply conservative former congressman and talk-radio host, could help him unite the disparate blocs within the Republican coalition — especially social conservatives and establishment leaders, who remain skeptical of if not outright hostile to Trump. A Republican official in touch with Pence's associates said Thursday morning that Pence told those associates he was convinced after his Wednesday meeting with Trump that he was going to be the pick. On Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers reacted to the reports by showering praise on Pence but cautioned that they, too, had received no word on the selection from Trump or his campaign. \\"I'm happy for him and happy for the ticket,\\" said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who advises Trump on foreign policy and other issues. Although Corker added, \\"I don't know for real that this is it. … I'm surprised. I would have thought they'd be waiting until tomorrow — usually people wait until the last minute to make a decision. So that's why I'm a little cautious.\\" Pence, whose gubernatorial tenure has been marked by controversy over a state law seen as discriminatory against gays, would be a seasoned politician and conservative ideologue at Trump's side. He has not always agreed with Trump's policy ideas, however. Last December, for instance, Pence criticized Trump's controversial proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional. — Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) December 8, 2015 On trade, Trump has campaigned as a strident protectionist, voicing opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership that was favored by most congressional Republicans and vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement as president. In September 2014, Pence tweeted in favor of the TPP: Trade means jobs, but trade also means security. The time has come for all of us to urge the swift adoption of the Trans Pacific Partnership — Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) September 8, 2014 And as a member of Congress, Pence voted for every free-trade agreement that he faced. Trump is known to value loyalty and those who have supported him from the beginning of his bid. Pence endorsed Trump's rival Ted Cruz shortly before the Indiana primary in May. While the endorsement was notably tepid and seemed designed not to offend Trump as little as possible, it was nonetheless time when they were clearly at odds with one another. With his comfortable victory in Indiana a few days later that endorsement, Trump effectively clinched the nomination -- knocking out his final two opponents: Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Trump has long said he wanted a running mate with governing experience who could help him enact his agenda in Washington. In addition to Pence, Gingrich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also were finalists. Both men spoke with Trump on Wednesday during the candidate’s stay in Indiana, following a Tuesday night rally with Pence. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), considered a long-shot candidate but one who has grown close to Trump, also visited with Trump in Indiana and traveled with him to California late Wednesday. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a registered Democrat, was another person considered by Trump in recent days. But all morning Thursday, there were signs that Pence had become Trump’s top choice. The governor convened an 8 a.m. meeting in Indianapolis with political allies to go over logistics should he join the ticket, Time magazine reported. Pence has until midday Friday to withdraw from his reelection campaign and remove himself from the Indiana ballot, something he would need to do if he were to run for vice president. [The Fix: 10 things you should know about Mike Pence] Also Thursday, Marc Lotter, Pence’s deputy campaign manager, was spotted by reporters on a flight from Indianapolis to New York, where Friday’s announcement will be made. The moves had Pence associates in Indiana abuzz about his likely selection. One of the governor’s top advisers and fundraisers said, “Most everybody in Indiana thinks it’s Pence.” #veepstakes mania watch 2 -- Marc Lotter, deputy campaign manager for @GovPenceIN on my flight from Indy to NYC. I'm sure just coincidence — Major Garrett (@MajorCBS) July 14, 2016 The selection of Pence would be a calculated overture to the party's wary right wing and to establishment leaders who have urged the candidate to tap a steady partner. The hope within Trump's orbit has been that he could win plaudits from powerful Republicans for going with someone they largely find acceptable — and that he could get a fresh look from general-election voters who have been eager for signs of seriousness from the combative businessman. Indeed, many GOP lawmakers praised Pence on Thursday. \\"Mike Pence has the legislative experience, having been in Congress and been a leader here,\\" said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.). \\"I think he'd be a good choice, but that doesn't mean the other guys aren't good choices, too.\\" Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.) said picking Pence would be a wise choice by Trump, though he said he had not heard directly from the governor that he had been selected. \\"He makes the ticket better from day one,\\" Messner said. \\"I think it will be an important step towards bringing the entire coalition behind the Trump ticket.\\" But some more moderate Republican lawmakers said they were concerned Pence is too rigidly conservative to help Trump broaden his appeal to the general electorate. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), a Trump critic, said the selection of Pence is \\"not good enough for me\\" to change his mind about endorsing Trump. And Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) said that despite Pence's good tone and temperament, he is too conservative on social issues. \\"If the objective is to broaden the appeal of the party beyond the base, I'm not sure this would be the wisest choice,\\" he said. In Pence, a 57-year-old evangelical Christian and father of three, Trump would have a vice-presidential nominee who is relatively little-known nationally but highly regarded by wealthy conservative donors such as the Koch brothers. Pence also provides a vivid contrast in style — with his full head of white hair, folksy demeanor and a smooth Midwestern voice that led him to be called \\"Rush Limbaugh on decaf\\" during his broadcasting years. Whereas Trump is known as a gregarious and fast-talking New Yorker, Pence speaks frequently about God and prayer and refers to his work as \\"servant leadership.\\" Pence often calls himself a \\"small-town kid who grew up with a cornfield in the back yard and dreaming of serving my country in public office.\\" Trump grew up the son of a businessman in New York who built a real-estate empire, attending military school and later the Ivy League. Sean Sullivan, Kelsey Snell, Karoun Demirjian, Amber Phillips and Jim Tankersley in Washington contributed to this story.

After researching online: Wild Boar silencer: - Heavy bass dug-dug sound - High-quality materials used - Provides better low-end torque Red Rooster silencer: - Increases the engine's overall performance - Decent dug-dug sound, but not as bass-heavy as Wild Boar - Compatible with various Royal Enfield models Comparing the performance and sound quality produced by the Wild Boar silencer and the Red Rooster silencer for the Royal Enfield Classic 350, it seems that the Wild Boar silencer produces a louder and heavier thump (dug-dug) sound. However, the Red Rooster silencer offers enhancements in engine performance. Regarding the given question: \\"Please tell me if those questions are the same.\\" Answer: (A). no.

More on this story and other news from London Nibbs, who has prostate cancer, claimed he had acted in self defence and that he thought Ms Nibbs was a \\"snake\\" - but jurors heard he had shown no sign of mental illness. The Recorder of London Nicholas Hilliard QC told him: \\"I'm sure you don't regret your wife's death save for its effect on your own comfort and well-being.\\" Defence lawyer Ian Henderson QC told the court that Nibbs acknowledged that his ill health meant he would die in jail. Nibbs attacked the mother of his two children after she had taunted him that she had had affairs. After knocking her unconscious with the iron bar, he then cut off her head before attacking it with a mallet. He then wrote a note to his son and called 999 to say two bodies would be found at the property. When police arrived, Nibbs was attempting to stab himself. Officers broke the door down before grappling with Nibbs who was armed with a shotgun and knife. Jurors heard that their relationship soured when he suspected Ms Nibbs of having affairs. Their son said that since his mother no longer had to care for his younger sister, Nibbs felt she had changed and was not the \\"housewife\\" she used to be. During a row Ms Nibbs admitted seeing other men, taunting her partner by saying: \\"I have had sex eight times.\\" The next day she inadvertently predicted her own killing as she left work with the words: \\"If I'm not in Friday, I might be dead.\\" Nibbs told the court that he had only meant to \\"slap her around a bit\\" and it was only after she was dead that he cut her head off in anger because she \\"betrayed\\" him.

This statement suggests an inability to participate or connect with something or someone, and often implies a sense of disappointment, frustration, or limitation. To further analyze the sentiment, let's dive into the individual elements of the sentence: 1. \\"can not\\" - This phrase indicates impossibility or that something cannot happen. It sets a limiting tone to the sentence, which generally isn't viewed as pleasant or uplifting. 2. \\"engage\\" - The verb 'engage' speaks to the act of participating, interacting, or connecting with someone or something. In this context, it can relate to engaging with people, discussions, social or work activities, or general experiences.

The recall came as a result of \\"an ongoing investigation into 24 illnesses in multiple states,\\" the USDA said. The initial recall of 41,280 pounds announced last Wednesday was voluntarily expanded Sunday to include an additional 380,000 pounds of products made by the JBS Swift Beef Company, of Greeley, Colorado, the USDA said. The recall came as a result of \\"an ongoing investigation into 24 illnesses in multiple states, of which at least 18 appear to be associated,\\" the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a written statement. USDA spokesman Brian Mabry said no fatalities had been reported. On its Web site, the company said the suspect beef was produced at its Greeley plant on April 21 and distributed nationally and internationally. \\"Each of our customers will be personally informed of this recall by phone,\\" the wholesaler said. A spokesman would not identify those customers to CNN. \\"That's ridiculous!\\" said Sarah Klein, a staff attorney for the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest. \\"JBS should be able to say who they sold meat to, and those companies should be able to say, 'These are the products we created from them.' \\" She expressed concern that nearly seven months into the Obama administration, a key undersecretary position at the USDA has not been filled, which may be slowing the government's ability to respond to such health threats. \\"That person in that position would have significant public health experience and understand how these processes work, how meat enters the chain of commerce,\\" Klein said. The recall underscores the need for \\"a comprehensive animal identification system\\" that would allow meat suppliers to trace their products to an individual ranch, she said. Klein urged supermarkets that use customer loyalty cards to track shoppers' purchases to determine those who have bought the recalled meat. Boxes of the recalled product bear the establishment number \\"EST. 969\\" inside the USDA mark of inspection, the identifying package date of \\"042109\\" and a time stamp ranging from \\"0618\\" to \\"1130,\\" the statement said. It added that some of the beef products might have undergone further processing and might not have the \\"EST. 969\\" marking on products for sale directly to consumers. The USDA urged any customers with concerns to contact the store where they bought the meat. JBS spokesman Chandler Keys said his company's products may have had nothing to do with the outbreak. \\"It is important for consumers to note that the recalled product from the date in question was sold by JBS as whole muscle cuts, not as ground beef,\\" Keys said on the company's Web site. \\"The ground beef that might have been associated with illness was produced by other companies who often do not use the antimicrobial intervention steps we employ in our facility to reduce the risk of the beef products.\\" He said JBS agreed to expand its recall \\"out of an abundance of caution for consumers.\\" Symptoms of infection with E. coli bacteria can include severe or bloody diarrhea, vomiting and severe abdominal cramping. The USDA urged consumers to cook all ground beef or ground beef patties to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit to kill any bacteria. CNN's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.

From the fog emerge two pedestrians: King Arthur (Graham Chapman), dressed in chain mail, a tunic and a crown; and Patsy (Terry Gilliam), who appears to be fulfilling the role of beast of burden, and is using two half-coconuts percussively.They approach a castle and Patsy perfectly mimics the sound of a galloping horse coming to a stop. Two guards become barely visible atop the castle wall. Arthur announces that he is looking for knights to join him at Camelot, and wishes to recruit the master of the castle. Unfortunately, the two guards are immediately distracted by Patsy's half-coconuts. Arthur tries to return the conversation to the quest, but the guards are unable to turn their attentions from the possible causes for coconuts appearing in Mercia (England), as Arthur claims that they found them there, or how a bird, or a set of birds, might have brought one up from the tropics.

A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age. Martin Doherty, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, led the team of scientists. In this experiment, Doherty and his team tested the perception of some people, using pictures of some orange circles. The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people. The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle. As a result, they're more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick. When asked to find the larger circle, _ . A) children at 6 got it wrong 79 % of the time with no gray ones around B) only adults over 18 got it right 95% of the time with gray ones around C) children at 4 got it right about 79 % of the time with gray ones around D) adults got it right most of the time with gray ones around Answer:","completion":"C) children at 4 got it right about 79 % of the time with gray ones around"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The infection cleared up after adding alcohol rather than cider, because in this case, the","completion":"alcohol was a more effective disinfectant and antiseptic agent, which facilitated the healing process and prevented the possibility of further complications. The alcohol, specifically ethanol or isopropanol, possesses antimicrobial properties that are ideal for eliminating a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Cider, although it does contain some alcohol content, is usually not potent enough to have a significant impact on disinfection. Additionally, cider contains sugars and other organic compounds that might support the growth of microbes, counteracting any potential benefits that its alcohol content might offer. This is why, in this case, alcohol was deemed a better choice compared to cider. The use of alcohol as an antiseptic can be traced back centuries to ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Its germ-killing properties have been widely accepted and documented in various cultures, especially for surface disinfection and wound cleansing. When applied to minor cuts, scrapes, or infections, alcohol destroys or inhibits the growth of microorganisms, thus reducing the risk of infection. It breaks down the outer cell membrane, causing vital proteins within the microbes to become denatured or lose their functional capacity—one of the primary reasons why alcohol is so effective. However, it is also essential to ensure that the alcohol concentration is suitable for disinfection. A concentration between 60% and 90% is considered most effective, as it permeates the cells of the microorganisms, causing irreversible damage. If the concentration is below this range, alcohol may not be effective enough, while exceeding the recommended range might cause the proteins to coagulate too rapidly, potentially forming a barrier that could protect the microbes from further damage. While alcohol proved to be efficient in clearing up the infection in this case, it is worth noting that it should be used with caution and only for certain types of infections and minor wounds. Alcohol has a drying effect on the skin and can cause considerable discomfort or irritation—especially for those with sensitive skin. Moreover, it is not recommended for deep wounds or punctures, where it could potentially delay the healing process. In conclusion, the infection cleared up after adding alcohol rather than cider because, in this case, the alcohol was more suitable for disinfection and preventing the growth of harmful pathogens. The antimicrobial properties of alcohol helped to speed up the healing process, resulting in a faster recovery and ultimately reducing the risk of complications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They had been having problems falling asleep: This reason seems to be the most plausible as the individual mentioned they \\"did n't sleep one wink\\" and have not slept well for two nights this week. Insomnia, which refers to the difficulty in falling or staying asleep, could be the primary issue in this case. Insomnia can be caused by various factors including stress, anxiety, poor sleep hygiene, or an underlying medical condition. Examining and addressing the causes of their insomnia might help the individual improve their sleep quality. II. They had to stay up all night for school: While it is possible that school-related responsibilities might be contributing to their sleeplessness, the information provided does not directly mention any connection with school. Therefore, this option might not be the most accurate reason for their lack of sleep. III. None of the above choices: This option implies that there could be other factors not mentioned in the available choices that are causing the individual to experience sleeplessness. It is important to consider this possibility as various external and internal influences might be affecting their sleep quality. For instance, environmental factors like noise or temperature, consumption of stimulants such caffeine or nicotine, or emotional stressors could be contributing to their sleep disturbances. IV. They had to stay up late for their job: Similar to option II, the information provided does not directly mention any correlation between their job and their sleeplessness. While work-related stress or late-night shifts can certainly interfere with an individual's sleep habits, we cannot definitively determine if this is the primary cause of their sleep issues without further information.

However, it is crucial to consider the possibility that there might be other influencing factors not covered in the given options (option III).

Which farm used fewer herbicide-resistant seeds? Two neighboring farms used different farming methods. Hill farm used GMO seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds. Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...

Information: - When Emperor Shmu ordered two official temples for each province (one for male Buddhist priests and one for nuns), two temples were founded in Aki Province. The provincial temple was founded in present-day Saij, Higashihiroshima. - The Mri clan ( \\"Mri-shi\\") was a family of \\"daimys\\", descended from e no Hiromoto and established themselves in Aki Province. Their name was derived from a shen in Mri, Aik District, Sagami Province. Hiromoto's descendants began to name themselves the Mri. - History. Sagami was one of the original provinces of Japan established in the Nara period under the Taih Code. The area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Although remnants from the Japanese Paleolithic and Yayoi periods are scarce, remains from the Jmon period are relatively plentiful. Kofun period remains are generally from the 1st 4th centuries AD. Whether or not Sagami was originally part of Musashi prior to the Nara period is still a topic of controversy. - Araki Murashige ( , 1535 -- June 20 , 1586 ) was a retainer of Oda Nobunaga , and daimy ( feudal lord ) of Itami Castle during the late Sengoku period of the 16th century in Japanese history , in what is now Itami city in Hygo Prefecture . He commanded part of Nobunaga 's army in the ten - year siege of the Ishiyama Honganji , but was accused in 1578 of sympathies to the Mri clan , one of Nobunaga 's enemies , by Akechi Mitsuhide . He retreated to Itami and held out there against a one - year siege by the forces of Oda before the castle fell in 1579 ; Araki escaped , and lived out the rest of his life as a chanoyu disciple of Sen no Rikyu . There is a semi-legendary tale told about Araki 's creative use of a tessen , or iron fan , in saving his own life .

Would \\"Normal resting heart rates range from 60-100 bpm.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"Your resting heart rate (RHR) is the number of times your heart beats per minute (bpm) while you are at complete rest. It is highly individual and can be affected by factors such as fitness level, age, and overall health. While the normal resting heart rate for adults, including 24-year-olds, generally falls within the range of 60-100 bpm, this is a wide range and might not accurately represent your specific resting heart rate. A more specific classification is that a well-trained athlete typically has a lower RHR, between 40 and 60 bpm, while a sedentary person might have an RHR toward the higher end of the normal range. It is essential to note that a \\"normal\\" resting heart rate is subjective and varies from person to person. To determine your personal resting heart rate, you can measure it manually by counting your pulse or using a heart rate monitor. Ideally, measure it in a relaxed state, such as first thing in the morning before getting out of bed. It is also suggested to measure it over a few days and calculate the average to get a more accurate representation. Remember that if you have concerns about your RHR or it drastically differs from the normal range, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for guidance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Q:- These plants die - The soil gains organic material - The soil becomes more fertile - Larger plants are able to be supported - Trees eventually grow. What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process is the establishment of pioneer species in the area, which can help gradually transform an uninhabited or disturbed environment into a thriving ecosystem. Pioneer species are hardy, adaptable organisms, typically fast-growing plants, lichens, or mosses, that can efficiently colonize an area with extreme conditions or poor soils. In the context of the process described, the pioneer species, often small plants or ground-covering vegetation, could establish itself on barren or disrupted land where other plants may struggle to survive. This could be due to factors such as soil erosion, lack of moisture, or even post-forest fires and other natural disasters. These plants are well-adapted to surviving in harsh conditions, and they often have efficient mechanisms for reproducing, dispersing seeds, and growing rapidly. These pioneer species play a critical role in initiating the process of ecological succession, which eventually leads to the formation of a stable, biodiverse ecosystem, including the growth of trees. As the pioneer plants grow, mature, and die, they contribute organic material to the soil through decomposition, enriching the nutrient content and ultimately improving the fertility of the soil. This accumulation of organic matter also aids in the retention of moisture, which helps support a diverse range of life forms in the area. With the soil becoming more fertile over time, larger and more complex plants can establish themselves and outcompete the pioneer species. These new and typically slower-growing species continue to contribute to the overall improvement of the soil, with their deeper root systems helping to stabilize and structure the soil particles. This progression of plant life also provides habitats and resources for various animal species, which in turn helps to create a more intricate and well-balanced ecosystem. As larger plants continue to grow, taller and more robust species such as shrubs and young trees begin to emerge. These trees eventually create a microclimate and protective canopy, which helps to further conserve soil moisture and shield the undergrowth, fostering the development of even more diverse plant and animal species. Over several decades to centuries of ecological succession, the area evolves into a stable, thriving, and self-sufficient forest ecosystem, supporting a vast array of species, both flora and fauna. In conclusion, the first step of the process described is the establishment of pioneer species in the area. These initial-stage organisms not only take advantage of otherwise inhospitable habitats but also lay the foundation for the ongoing development and maturation of an ecosystem through the contributions of organic material, improving soil fertility, and supporting the growth of larger, more complex plants and, eventually, trees."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the following context: The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi. They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs. Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture). In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \\"Art of Dying\\". It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy. As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones. answer the following question: What shows a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art?","completion":"The Catacombs of Rome serve as a vital source for understanding the emergence of Christian iconography, initially from Roman popular decorative art. The early Christian art found within the catacombs, primarily in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi, display a gradual development of distinct Christian symbolism and artistic representations. In the beginning, early Christians refrained from creating iconic images of religious figures, primarily due to their persecution and the need for discretion in their religious practices. Instead, they focused on decorating sarcophagi with diverse motifs, ornaments and Christian symbols. A significant example of this is the use of the Chi Rho monogram, which stands for the first two letters of the Greek word for 'Christ' and is one of the earliest forms of christogram. As time progressed and the Christian community evolved, their art began to borrow elements from official imperial and pagan motifs, integrating these influences to develop a unique and distinguishing Christian iconography. This shift is visible in the narrative religious scenes depicted in the frescoes and sarcophagi found within the catacombs, which showcased biblical stories and the lives of saints. Furthermore, the early Christians' practice of building churches, such as the famous St. Peter's in Rome, over the burial sites of martyrs contributed to the emergence of a distinct Christian funerary art style. This resulted in the creation of church monuments and tombs inside sacred spaces, differentiating them from other cultures such as Judaism, Hinduism, and classical paganism that considered the dead ritually impure and avoided the mixture of temples and cemeteries. In summary, the Catacombs of Rome are an essential testament to the emergence of Christian iconography from the initially Roman popular decorative art. The progression from simple symbolic decorations to the adoption of imperial and pagan elements, combined with the unique practices of honoring martyrs and incorporating religious art into sacred spaces, showcases the development of a rich and identifiable Christian artistic tradition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer this question: where was the first transatlantic phone call made?","completion":"The first transatlantic phone call was made on January 7, 1927, between New York City, USA, and London, United Kingdom. This groundbreaking call was a collaboration between American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) and the British General Post Office. The technology at the forefront of this historical event was the Bell System's development of long-range telephony. The first transmission of sound across the Atlantic Ocean was done through radio waves in 1915, and it set the stage for future innovations in communication. The first successful commercial transatlantic telephone service between the United States and the United Kingdom, however, relied on undersea telegraph cables, a significant upgrade from radio-based communication. In order to make this first transatlantic phone call possible, several critical components had to be put into place. The most crucial element was the development of the proper infrastructure to support long-range telecommunication. This involved laying approximately 2,225 miles of undersea telegraph cable from Bell System's station at Horta, in the Azores, to the General Post Office's station located at Ballantrae, Scotland. Additional cables continued from Scotland to Hayes in the outskirts of London. This complex network of cables enabled a stable connection across the Atlantic Ocean. The call itself was conducted in two stages. The first stage of the call involved an exchange of conversations between the AT&T's president, Walter S. Gifford, in New York and Sir Evelyn P. Murray, who was the secretary of the General Post Office in London. The conversation marked the beginning of the transatlantic telephone service, with Gifford expressing his excitement about the impact of the new technology. While the technology of their time produced a slight delay in call response, the quality of the connection was remarkable for its time. The second stage of the call involved renowned figures, with American inventor and industrialist Thomas A. Watson in San Francisco, speaking to Sir Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of the radio telegraph system, in Genoa, Italy. The success of the call was hailed as a significant milestone in breaking barriers for global communication. This first transatlantic phone call opened up new possibilities and expanded communication networks around the world. The event's success paved the way for future advancements in telecommunications, leading to the development of modern communication methods such as satellite telephony and fiber optic connections. Today, we can stay connected to people across vast distances with relative ease, thanks to the ambitious strides made by visionaries during those formative years in global telecommunication history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The size and mass of Dwingeloo 1 are comparable to those of Triangulum Galaxy. - Dwingeloo 2 is a small irregular galaxy discovered in 1996 and located about 10 million light - years away from the Earth . Its discovery was a result of Dwingeloo Obscured Galaxy Survey ( DOGS ) of the Zone of Avoidance . Dwingeloo 2 is a companion galaxy of Dwingeloo 1 . Dwingeloo 2 was first detected at radio wavelengths from the 21 cm emission line of neutral atomic hydrogen ( known to astronomers as HI ) in the course of follow - up observations after the discovery of Dwingeloo 1 . Dwingeloo 2 is thought to be a member of the IC 342/Maffei Group , a galaxy group adjacent to the Local Group . The galaxy recedes from the Milky Way at the speed of about 241 km / s. The visible radius of Dwingeloo 2 is approximately 2 , which at the distance of 3 Mpc corresponds to about 2 kpc . Dwingeloo 2 has a well defined rotating HI disk inclined at approximately 69 ° with respect to observer . The distribution of the neutral hydrogen in Dwingeloo 2 is quite irregular , and it is detected as far as 3.2 kpc from the center of the galaxy . The total mass of the galaxy within this radius is estimated at 2.3 billion Solar masses , while the mass of the neutral hydrogen is estimated at about 100 million Solar masses . The total mass of the galaxy is about five times less than that of Dwingeloo 1 . The irregular structure of Dwingeloo 2 is likely related to its interaction with the much larger nearby galaxy Dwingeloo 1 , which lies at a distance of only 24 kpc from Dwingeloo 2 . - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers.

The idea of an album in this context refers to a collection of audio recordings issued as a single item on CD, record, or another medium. Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at 33 1⁄3 rpm. In more details about this specific album, \\"Dee Gee Days: The Savoy Sessions\\" by Dizzy Gillespie includes performances recorded in 1951 and 1952, originally released under the musician's own label, Dee Gee. At that time, it was common for artists to release their own music on labels they owned themselves. Later, tracks from this album were released on other albums, including \\"School Days\\" (Regent) and \\"The Champ\\" (Savoy), which is common practice in the music industry. This practice allows audiences to access and purchase music in a variety of formats and groupings, depending on their taste, preferences, and needs. Importantly, the artist behind this album, Dizzy Gillespie, is a respected, renowned musician in the world of Jazz, known for his extensive contributions as a trumpeter, bandleader, composer, and singer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Loch Tay (Scottish Gaelic, \\"Loch Tatha\\") is a freshwater loch in the central highlands of Scotland, in the Perth and Kinross and Stirling council areas. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Northern Isles is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century. - In common law systems, land tenure is the legal regime in which land is owned by an individual, who is said to \\"hold\\" the land. The French verb \\"tenir\\" means \\"to hold\\" and \\"tenant\\" is the present participle of \\"tenir\\". The sovereign monarch, known as The Crown, held land in its own right. All private owners are either its tenants or sub-tenants. \\"Tenure\\" signifies the relationship between tenant and lord, not the relationship between tenant and land. - Crofting is a form of land tenure and small-scale food production particular to the Scottish Highlands, the islands of Scotland, and formerly on the Isle of Man. Within the 19th century townships, individual crofts are established on the better land, and a large area of poorer-quality hill ground is shared by all the crofters of the township for grazing of their livestock. - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times. - Perth and Kinross is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland and a Lieutenancy Area. It borders onto the Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Fife, Highland and Stirling council areas. Perth is the administrative centre. The council boundaries correspond broadly, but not exactly, with the former counties of Perthshire and Kinross-shire. - Fearnan ( Gaelic Feàrnan , ' Alders ' ) is a small crofting village on the north shore of Loch Tay in Perthshire , Scotland . The village lies at the junction of the road to Glen Lyon and the road between Kenmore and Killin that runs along the north side of the loch . The land around the village has at various times in history belonged to both the Robertsons of Struan and the Campbells . The village is now a mix of old crofts dating back up to 400 years and new builds mainly from the 1980s . There is also a whole hidden village of crofts with just their foundations left , just below the forestry of Drummond Hill . Visitors who wish to explore the area are encouraged to park at the village hall and walk up the field opposite , clamber over the wall and walk right , where there is a road covered in fern , then walk up the hill , and with a bit of searching they will find the remnants of the houses . The village 's only hotel , the Tigh - an - Loan , went out of business in 2008 and the building was demolished a year later . Up to the early 1970s , this loch - side hotel also ran a small garage / filling station plus the village post office . The latter moved to a new building just east of the junction for Fortingall but even that closed in 2001 and now the nearest shops are in Kenmore , 3.5 miles away . Along with several other village schools around Loch Tay , the one class village primary school ( where Kate Maynard was the last teacher ) closed in 1983 when a new comprehensive primary school opened in the grounds of Taymouth Castle in Kenmore . Secondary school pupils have always had to travel to Aberfeldy ( 10 miles from Fearnan ) and that situation continues today . Across the road from the former school building lies the remains of Fearnan Pier , one of five intermediate piers served until 1946 by the Caledonian ( later LMS ) Railway 's steamers plying from Killin to Kenmore and back . At the top of the road leading up from the lochside , 20 metres past Quarry Road ( a single lane road accessing the top... - Perthshire, officially the County of Perth, is a registration county in central Scotland. It extends from Strathmore in the east, to the Pass of Drumochter in the north, Rannoch Moor and Ben Lui in the west, and Aberfoyle in the south. It was a local government county from 1890 to 1930. - Ben Lui (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Laoigh) is a mountain in the southern Highlands of Scotland, at the head of Glen Fyne. It has five well-defined ridges radiating out from the summit. Four corries lie between the ridges; including Coire Gaothaich which lies on the northeast side of the mountain. - The Pass of Drumochter is the main mountain pass between the northern and southern central Scottish Highlands. The A9 road passes through here, as does the Highland Main Line, the railway between Inverness and the south of Scotland. The Sustrans National Cycle Route 7 between Glasgow and Inverness also runs through the pass. - Rannoch Moor (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Mòinteach Raineach/Raithneach\\") is an expanse of around 50 square miles (130 km²) of boggy moorland to the west of Loch Rannoch in Scotland, where it extends from and into westerly Perth and Kinross, northerly Lochaber (in Highland), and the area of Highland Scotland toward its south-west, northern Argyll and Bute. Rannoch Moor is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation. - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - The Highlands (\\"the place of the Gaels\\") are a historic region of Scotland. The region became culturally distinguishable from the Lowlands from the later Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands. The Scottish Gaelic name of \\"A' Ghàidhealtachd\\" literally means \\"the place of the Gaels\\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands. - Loch is the Irish and Scottish Gaelic word for a lake or for a sea inlet. It is cognate with the Manx lough, Cornish logh, and the Welsh word for lake, llyn. - Scottish Gaelic or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to as Gaelic (\\" ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - A registration county was, in Great Britain and Ireland, a statistical unit used for the registration of births, deaths and marriages and for the output of census information.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write highlights for this article: Books, movies, magazines and newspapers repeatedly refer to addiction, usually concerning drugs or alcohol. It is only recently, in the modern realm of celebrity addictions that the public discourse has added sex to the list of potential afflictions (see: Tiger Woods, David Duchovny) and the general public is still rather slow on acceptance. How can something as fun as sex be an addiction, you ask? The answer is, any addiction is potentially destructive, turning something enjoyable, like a pint of beer or an intimate evening into something entirely different. Feeling compelled can take the joy out of anything. \\"Shame,\\" the excellent and profoundly disturbing sophomore film (following 2008's highly-regarded \\"Hunger\\") from English director Steve McQueen, is basically a character study of two damaged souls and their relationships both with each other and the world around them. It's a penetrating and deeply unsettling look at addiction, obsession and self-destruction. Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is an upwardly-mobile, thirtysomething New Yorker who just happens to spend every waking moment that he's not otherwise occupied with work, engaged in some sort of sexual activity. Pornography, escorts, random encounters, group sex, masturbation ... all are fair game. He is an addict by any definition of the word and lest you consider sex addiction as a comparatively harmless addiction compared with, say, drugs or alcohol, think again. It's as if he's constantly in pain and sex is the only way to stop the agony, to shut his emotional life away in a box. It's routine self-numbing, and however charming or chatty Brandon may be in public, it's all just a means to an end -- the search for sexual release. Maintaining a tenuous balancing act between his work life and his life as an addict, Brandon is thrown off the rails by a visit from his equally but differently damaged younger sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan). The two have a past. Something has happened in their childhood that has shaped their lives and their relationship and each has dealt with it in a different way. While we might be able to read into their behavior somewhat, we are largely left to imagine what that past might contain. While Brandon has buried his emotions in sexual release, Sissy is the opposite and wears hers on her sleeve, along with scars from a past of cutting and perhaps, suicide attempts. She is all externalized emotions, a gadabout to Brandon's stoic. She's a nightclub performer and extrovert, the exact opposite of her brother's bottled-up persona, and her visit upsets his apple cart completely. In this oil-and-water sibling relationship, all he wants is for her to take life seriously and exhibit some responsibility, while she's trying to get him to loosen up and have some fun. It seems as though neither is capable of doing what the other wants and both are eminently self-destructive. He is used to his solo sex life: He has an extensive porn collection, uses escorts frequently and visits Internet sex sites, all of which are interrupted by Sissy's visit. She has no idea of his addiction and when she stumbles onto it, things go pear-shaped, but fast. Fassbender's performance is not entirely unlike the one he gives in David Cronenberg's \\"A Dangerous Method\\" in that much of his character's emotional life goes on beneath the surface. However, in \\"Shame\\" it's reversed. While his portrayal of Carl Jung in the Cronenberg film came alive when he was with Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), Brandon shuts down when he's in sexual situations and the only person who can coax an emotion out of him is Sissy -- and that emotion usually is anger. Sissy, on the other hand, is just looking for some love, caring and protection from her big brother. It's clear the two don't see each other very often, otherwise she'd know that Brandon is the last person to go to for those things and the last to understand what she needs. Carey Mulligan more than holds her own against yet another impressive 2011 performance from Fassbender, giving one of the best female performances in a year rife with them. A decent shot at a best supporting actress Oscar nomination, her Sissy is an open wound, raw and emotionally unguarded and working without a safety net. For his part, Fassbender inhabits Brandon like a less-homicidal version of Patrick Bateman (\\"American Psycho\\"). Cool, calm and collected, his emotions buried ... until they aren't and they leap out of him in a torrent. Like any addict, he's forever searching for something to soothe his pain. The third major character in \\"Shame\\" is New York City, and McQueen shows its cold, bleak and rather lonely side. If you've lived there for any length of time, you ought to understand: For such a large and vibrant city, it can make you feel like you're the last person on earth. McQueen uses the subways and dark, outer borough streets, bars and clubs to great effect, leaving most of the city (and most of its occupants) outside a tight frame and out of focus. No sweeping, glorious views of the skyline, but rather tight shots of Brandon on the subway or in a club. Even many of the sex scenes are shot as a collection of limbs and faces and breasts and other various body parts so you often aren't exactly sure where one person ends and another begins. As for said sex scenes, they are anything but sexy. By the time the most graphic of Brandon's encounters occurs, arousal doesn't even enter the mind. Much how \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" was unlikely to cause most people to reach for a vodka on the rocks, \\"Shame\\" is not going to be the cause for much late-night pillow talk. On the other hand, it may just make you reach for that drink. \\"Shame\\" is rated NC-17 (no one under 17 admitted). There's a lot of graphic sex, all sorts of nudity and the subject matter is pretty damn dark. Highlights:","completion":"1. \\"Shame\\" is a powerful film that explores the themes of addiction, obsession, and self-destruction through the story of two damaged siblings, Brandon and Sissy. 2. Directed by Steve McQueen, the film is a character study of Brandon, a sex addict whose life becomes increasingly complicated when his sister, Sissy, comes to visit. 3. Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Brandon is a complex performance that shows the character's emotional struggle, while Carey Mulligan gives an outstanding performance as the emotionally vulnerable Sissy. 4. The film is set in New York City, which is shown as a cold, bleak, and lonely environment that reflects the characters' emotional states. 5. Rated NC-17, the film contains graphic sex scenes and nudity; however, these scenes are not meant to be erotic, but rather a demonstration of the characters' dysfunctional relationships with sexuality and intimacy. 6. \\"Shame\\" is a deeply unsettling and thought-provoking look at the devastating consequences of addiction and the search for emotional connection in a disconnected world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kiraly had a long career on the professional beach circuit, and with 148 career wins is the 'winningest' player in the sport's history. He won at least one tournament in 24 of the 28 seasons he played in a career that spanned four decades. He claimed titles with 13 partners, and in domestic events he made it to the semifinals over 80% of the time. Kiraly competed into his mid-40s. Kiraly played in his first beach tournament at age 11 as his father's partner. Kiraly has said as an 11-year-old he was thrilled to discover in beach volleyball he could compete with grown men on even terms. He earned his A and AA rating on the beach at the age of 15 and his AAA rating at 17. Kiraly's first big beach breakthrough came at Hermosa Beach in 1978. As a 17-year-old who had just graduated from high school, he shocked Hermosa onlookers by gaining the finals before he and partner Marco Ortega lost to the day's dominant team on the beach, Jim Menges and Greg Lee. In the early 1980s, Kiraly made a successful beach team pairing with UCLA teammate Sinjin Smith. The partnership split up as Kiraly came to focus on the U.S National Team. In 1992 Kiraly left his indoor career behind, returning to the U.S. to play beach volleyball full-time on the AVP tour. Kiraly chose Kent Steffes as his doubles partner. Steffes was a talented younger player who had left UCLA early to start playing on the professional beach tour. Kiraly and Steffes soon became the dominant pairing on the tour, supplanting former teammate and doubles partner Smith and his partner Randy Stoklos as the beach's top team. In 1996 Kiraly returned to the Olympics, this time competing in beach volleyball with his partner, Steffes. Kiraly and Steffes won the gold medal, the first ever awarded for men's beach volleyball. Kiraly continued to win tournaments into his 40s, recording two AVP tournament victories with his partner Brent Doble in 2002 and 2003, and four more with Mike Lambert in 2004 and 2005. Kiraly's last victory came in August 2005, when he and Lambert won at Huntington Beach. In 2006, Kiraly partnered with Larry Witt, and in 2007 partnered with Kevin Wong. His teams continued to make high placings. Over his career on the beach, Kiraly won over 3 million in prize money, and earned considerably more in endorsements. Kiraly retired from the AVP tour after the 2007 season. Ultimately Kiraly won 148 professional beach volleyball titles, 74 of them with Steffes. The next closest player in total wins is Sinjin Smith at 139. Following Smith is his longtime partner, Randy Stoklos, at 122.

Answer:","completion":"The cell division process responsible for the formation of gametes is called meiosis. Gametes are the sex cells, specifically sperm and eggs, which are necessary for sexual reproduction. Meiosis is a specialized cell division process that occurs in sexually reproducing organisms, resulting in the production of gametes with half the number of chromosomes compared to the parent cell. This reduction in chromosome number is essential to maintain the correct number of chromosomes in the offspring after fertilization. Meiosis consists of two consecutive cell divisions, called Meiosis I and Meiosis II, each of which can be further divided into multiple stages: Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase. Meiosis I (The Reductional Division): 1. Prophase I: Chromosomes condense, and homologous chromosomes (chromosomes with the same genes, one from each parent) pair up, forming a structure called a bivalent or a tetrad. During this stage, a process called crossing over (or recombination) occurs, in which sections of DNA are exchanged between non-sister chromatids, increasing genetic diversity. The nuclear envelope also breaks down, and spindle fibers begin to form. 2. Metaphase I: The paired homologous chromosomes align at the middle of the cell (equatorial plate), with the spindle fibers attaching to the centromeres, which are specialized regions on the chromosomes. 3. Anaphase I: Spindle fibers pull the homologous chromosomes apart towards opposite poles of the cell. This is a crucial distinction from mitosis, where sister chromatids separate instead. 4. Telophase I: The chromosomes reach their respective poles, and a new nuclear envelope starts to form. The cell then undergoes cytokinesis, separating the cytoplasm, resulting in the formation of two daughter cells. Meiosis II (The Equational Division): 5. Prophase II: The nuclear envelope breaks down, and chromosomes condense again. Spindle fibers form anew in each of the two daughter cells from Meiosis I. 6. Metaphase II: The chromosomes align at the equatorial plate, with spindle fibers attaching to the chromatids' centromeres. 7. Anaphase II: Spindle fibers pull the sister chromatids apart and move them toward opposite poles of the cell. 8. Telophase II: The chromatids (now known as chromosomes) reach their respective poles, and the nuclear envelope reforms. Cytokinesis occurs, resulting in four haploid cells (cells with half the number of chromosomes). These cells will mature into gametes: sperm in males and eggs in females. It is essential to understand that meiosis is a crucial process in sexually reproducing organisms, as it helps maintain the correct chromosome number, increases genetic diversity through crossing over, and ultimately contributes to the survival and evolution of the species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Review 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' - Ben Stiller's Dream of Life I should almost disqualify myself from reviewing The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. The main character, played by Ben Stiller, works in midtown Manhattan’s Time + Life Building, my business home for 33 years. He is employed by a weekly Time Inc. news publication — Life, not TIME — which is about to be taken over and downsized; Time Inc. is to be spun off from its parent corporation, Time Warner, some time next year. Mitty’s job, now threatened, is to manage and care for the photographs of that great old publication; Mary Corliss ran the Museum of Modern Art Film Stills Archive for 34 years, and in 2002 she was abruptly let go, and that invaluable archive shuttered, after a four-and-a-half-month strike in which Mary played an important role. For my wife and me, watching this movie was like sitting through our surprise dual biography, so many of its images triggering memories of poignancy or pleasure. (READ: Mary and the Case of the Missing Film Stills) Mitty, directed by Stiller from Steve Conrad’s script, still could’ve stunk; and it has its occasional longueurs. But even people not named Corliss, people not involved in the endangered crafts of print journalism and photo curating, should be able to connect with the movie’s sweet and mournful tone. Anthony Lane, reviewing the film in The New Yorker, said it “keeps glancing backward, at the lost and the obsolete.” Exactly, and in a good way: Mitty pays tribute to people who cherish the past and, in the face of extinction, are devoted to preserving it. Beyond that, Mitty is a lovely romantic comedy — the portrait of a man, nearly swallowed by the gulf between the world his lives in and the world he dreams of, who manages to bridge the two and to find Ms. Right in the workplace he cherishes. The movie takes its title and little else from James Thurber‘s 2,079-word story published in The New Yorker 75 years ago next March. Thurber’s Mitty is a henpecked husband driving his wife to her weekly hair date in Waterbury, Conn. As his wife or a garage mechanic berates him, Mitty slips into five fantasy roles: a Navy Captain, a genius surgeon, a master criminal, a pilot on a suicide mission and, finally, a hero facing a firing squad. So meager and hopeless is Mitty’s life that his last daydream is of violent death. (READ: James Thurber’s story “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty”) The 1947 movie musical, starring Danny Kaye, took a half-step toward the new film. Mitty works as an editor of pulp-fiction magazines, whose lurid tales fuel his reveries; and a mysterious woman leads him into real-life exploits more extravagant than his wildest woolgatherings. Stiller’s Mitty also goes on adventures, though of his own choosing: to find the photograph that will be on the cover of Life’s final print edition. The expiring magazine is Walter’s secret Life. At the start, though, he is just a schlub with a furtive crush on his new Life colleague Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig). Logging on to eHarmony.com, he cannot even “wink” at Cheryl; the technology defeats him. Waiting for the train to take him downtown to work, Walter imagines a tenement building bursting into flames; like Superman, he vaults from the platform into the building to save Cheryl’s three-legged dog — and presents her with a furry prosthesis for the pet’s missing limb. At work, he materializes as a Spanish stud in a snow storm, wooing Cheryl with soothing words and a “poetry falcon”; and he sees himself as Benjamin Button, an infant with an old man’s face, cradled and nurtured by Cheryl. Unfortunately for Walter, he also fantasizes talking sass to Ted (Adam Scott), the slimy, bearded, three-piece-suited dude whose job is to turn Life from a magazine to a digital domain in the speediest, most contemptible way possible. Ted thinks Walter, petrified in his dreams, is an idiot who is withholding that last cover picture, taken by revered photographer Sean O’Connell (Sean Penn). In fact, the negative is missing, and locating it becomes Walter’s mission. He and the audience must follow three pictorial clues left by Sean; they lead Walter to Greenland, Iceland, the Himalayas and back home. (READ: a review of the 1947 The Secret Life of Walter Mitty by subscribing to TIME) The Stiller and Kaye films twisted Thurber’s thesis: that modern man seeks freedom in dreams from nagging reality but can never escape. Serious fiction, including serious humorous fiction, paints the cage that imprisons humanity. Movies, in the 1940s or today, unlock the cell door; the screen is a wall showing the rich life that society may deny us. Stiller’s Mitty lives in that dream world. Early in the film, Walter may have little hope; yet he and Cheryl are destined to come together, if only because they have eyes of a magical blue — movie-star eyes. And when he goes on his world tour, this little man in a sedentary job turns out to be an expert bicyclist, runner and skateboarder. The movie has a lot of Walter exercising. In development for nearly 20 years, the Mitty project was at one time or another to have starred Jim Carrey, Owen Wilson, Mike Myers or Sacha Baron Cohen, and to have been directed by Ron Howard, Chuck Russell, Steven Spielberg, Gore Verbinski or Mark Waters. The final script by Conrad, who had written The Weather Man for Verbinski, became Stiller’s fifth feature film as director, after Reality Bites, The Cable Guy, the great Zoolander and Tropic Thunder. (SEE: Derek Zoolander on one of the Top 10 fake TIME magazine covers) An auteur with an acute visual touch, Stiller fills the wide screen artfully and playfully. In one shot, our attention is directed to Walter in the rear of the frame: he’s a blur, even as his own undeveloped life is a picture that has not yet come into focus. The cue for Walter’s daydreams is often a subtle shift into a sharp, old-fashioned Kodachrome color. Later, on his intercontinental journey, he sees a flock of birds that assemble Cheryl’s face in the sky. As he treks the Himalayas, his words — “Now at 18,000 feet my mind drifts like the snow” — are scrawled across the screen like an entry in an adventurer’s diary. Stiller also extracts appealing performances from the supporting cast: Shirley MacLaine as Walter’s mother, Patton Oswalt as his eHarmony contact, Adrian Martinez as his dark-room assistant and especially Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as a drunken bear of a helicopter pilot. The most romantic notion held by this very dreamy film is the value of an important job done well. Roaming corridors filled with giant reproductions of old Life covers, Walter is haunted by Henry Luce’s mission statement in the first issue of Life, synopsized here as: “To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of Life.” And of Walter’s life, whether he is jumping from a helicopter into a turbulent sea infested with sharks or sitting in his photo archive trying to make a phantom picture come into focus. (READ: What would Henry Luce make of the digital age?) The Secret Life of Walter Mitty proclaims that the past is worth treasuring, every bit as much as the fantasy future. Like Walter — and two people named Corliss — this touching movie elegy believes not just in the wonder of what might be but in the glory of what was.","completion":"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a film directed by Ben Stiller, who also plays the main character. The movie, which takes inspiration from James Thurber's story published in The New Yorker 75 years ago and the 1947 movie musical, revolves around the character of Walter Mitty, a man who works in the Time + Life Building in midtown Manhattan. Mitty's job focuses on managing and caring for the photographs of the Life publication and his personal life comprises of a romantic journey in getting closer to his work colleague Cheryl Melhoff, played by Kristen Wiig. The movie presents a sweet and mournful tone as Mitty struggles to find the perfect photograph for the cover of Life's final print edition. Stiller delivers a visually captivating film that often uses daydreams as a powerful storytelling tool, exemplified by the subtle shift in color schemes, among other visual effects. The film combines elements of romance, humor, and adventure as Mitty travels to Greenland, Iceland, and the Himalayas in search of that elusive photograph. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty pays tribute to the past, highlighting the importance of preserving history and the value of a well-done job. It is a touching movie that reflects the wonder of the past, as well as the possibilities of what could be in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It just becomes unenforceable, that’s the problem the","completion":"BBC is facing. With the rise of digital streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, consumers are increasingly shifting away from traditional television and towards on-demand content. For the first time, the number of UK households equipped with a television has reported a decline. This behavioural shift is disrupting the established television industry, posing serious concerns for institutions such as the BBC that rely on television licensing fees for revenue. Traditionally, the BBC has obtained its primary funding from the licence fee paid by UK residents. This unique funding model enables the media organisation to produce diverse content, from radio programs to television dramas, news, and documentaries, being free from commercial pressure and political influence. Now, as more and more viewers switch to digital platforms to watch their favourite programmes on computers, tablets, smartphones, it makes the enforcement of the license fee much trickier. Moreover, a growing number of people question the need to pay a license fee for a service they perceive as less and less relevant. Members of Parliament have taken note of this shift, and are proposing that the funding model for the BBC be reevaluated given these changes. Many suggest that the new data “undermines the case for the licence fee”, as viewers now have access to their favourite programmes through online catch-up services such as BBC iPlayer, ITV Player and 4OD. Shows like Strictly Come Dancing, X Factor, and Gogglebox can be watched at leisure, free from schedule constraints, and often free of charge, making the traditional television model increasingly obsolete. A switch to a subscription-based model for BBC might be one solution. This would mean replacing the license fee with a monthly or yearly subscription fee akin to how services like Netflix or Amazon Prime operate. This would allow viewers to pay for the content they wish to watch. However, the impacts such a change could have on the BBC and wider broadcasting landscape would be considerable. The corporation may have to start producing more commercially viable content to draw and retain subscribers, possibly impacting the diversity and quality of the content. Some less popular but culturally important shows might be at risk of being axed if they fail to attract sufficient viewership. In short, the decline in the number of UK households possessing a television presents more than just a challenge to the traditional broadcast industry, it signifies a revolutionary shift in how media is consumed. It also raises urgent questions about how public broadcasting services like the BBC should be financed in a rapidly changing digital era. This will likely continue to be a topic of hot debate among law- and decision-makers, the broadcasting industry, and the viewing public, as we navigate this new digital landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The truth about girls and boys, toys and TV Uh-oh. Here comes more bad news for the “gender is a social construct” crowd. A new study by researchers at the City University of London found that babies as young as 9 months old prefer to play with toys specific to their own gender. The experimenters, whose results were published in the journal Infant and Child Development this month, put 101 girls and boys between the ages of 9 and 32 months in a nursery with a variety of toys and observed which ones the children seemed to play with more. The toys used in the study were a doll, a pink teddy bear, a cooking pot, a car, a blue teddy, a digger and a ball. Toys were placed a few feet from the children so they would have to make some effort to get to them, and then researchers observed not only which ones they chose, but also how they played with them and for how long. Among the youngest, they found, the boys tended to prefer the ball and the girls wanted the pot. While modern parents like to think that everything is in our control when it comes to socializing children, the researchers found the opposite to be true. They write: “Our findings of sex differences in toy choice in the 9 to 17 months age group add some weight to the suggestion that such preferences appear prior to extensive socialization and do not depend on gender category knowledge but are reflections of our biological heritage.” A recent photo series from a project called #ABoyCanToo has been going around on social media. It includes portraits of boys who pursue interests traditionally associated with girls. A Huffington Post article, “13 Empowering Photos Show There’s No ‘Right’ Way to Be a Boy,” says the pictures are “shining a light on kids who don’t let gender norms prevent them from following their dreams.” There’s a picture of a boy in a frilly lace dress and one dancing ballet and another with bows in his hair. But it’s not gender norms that are the biggest force at work here. Rather, it’s that boys are on average more inclined to play certain ways and girls are inclined to play other ways. Geula Zamist, the director of early childhood at a synagogue in New Jersey, recalls going to a museum gift shop with a friend many years ago. “I decided to buy all the children the same thing — a wooden recorder. By the time we got to the parking lot our 2-year-old boys were having a sword fight and our 4-year-old girls were giving a concert.” She says this is true in other instances as well. If you give boys and girls the same set of blocks, “boys will build tall towers and girls will build out flat.” So is our gender divide in toys entirely the product of nature? Obviously not. In fact, the researchers observed that babies and toddlers made almost no distinction between the blue and the pink teddy bears they were offered. Which suggests that certain things, like the color of a toy, only matter once kids are socialized to certain ideas — namely that pink is for girls and blue is for boys. But if you take a walk down any toy aisle, it quickly becomes apparent how significant that point is. The girls’ toy aisle looks like someone dumped a giant bottle of Pepto Bismol on it. Girls want not only princess dolls and pink cooking sets, they also start to want pink versions of games like Chutes and Ladders and Trouble. If you look into preschool classrooms, which usually have plain toys — wooden kitchens, dolls without clothing, simple blocks — you’ll see boys and girls moving more freely among different areas. There’ll generally be more boys in the blocks and more girls in the kitchen, but there is no flashing (pink) sign warning boys to keep away from the girl toys. But so much of toy companies’ success is actually tied to TV shows and movies that it’s making the divisions that are present naturally much more pronounced. Hasbro, which released its earnings last week, saw a 15 percent jump in what the company calls Partner Brand revenues — “Star Wars” for boys, Disney princesses for girls. If you want to “empower” your children, as the gender-norm warriors like to say, don’t take away your daughter’s dolls and give them trucks or demand your son stop using crayons as weapons. Instead, send kids to play outside more — girls and boys like to ride bicycles and play on swing sets — or buy them toys that aren’t tied to the latest movies or TV shows. However impossible it seems, it may mean doing more to separate our children from popular culture. Naomi Schaefer Riley is a senior fellow at the Independent Women’s Forum.

Add punctuation: Cauchy was the first to make a rigorous study of the conditions for convergence of infinite series in addition to his rigorous definition of an integral","completion":"Cauchy was the first to make a rigorous study of the conditions for convergence of infinite series. In addition to his rigorous definition of an integral, he also provided a foundation for the understanding of series convergence and laid the groundwork for future mathematicians to build upon. Cauchy's contribution to the field of mathematics is immense, and his work on infinite series and integrals is just one example. He explored a variety of mathematical concepts, including complex analysis, calculus, and algebra, with the same meticulous attention to detail and rigor that he brought to his study of infinite series. In his work on convergence, Cauchy looked at the conditions under which an infinite series would converge, meaning that the sum of its terms would approach a finite value. Before Cauchy, mathematicians had been working with infinite series without a clear understanding of the conditions necessary for convergence. As a result, erroneous conclusions were often drawn, leading to confusion and uncertainty. Cauchy's work not only established the rules for determining whether an infinite series converged, but it also clarified the importance of these rules. The Cauchy criterion for convergence played a critical role in the development of modern analysis, and it is still a cornerstone concept studied by mathematicians today. In addition to his work on convergence, Cauchy made significant contributions to the theory of integration. Before Cauchy, integration was often regarded as a somewhat magical process that, although it produced correct results, lacked a rigorous foundation. Cauchy changed this by introducing the concept of the definite integral, which provided a precise definition for the process of integration. Cauchy's definition of an integral relied on the concept of a limit, which he also defined rigorously. In doing so, Cauchy was able to demonstrate that integration was not just a convenient tool for solving problems, but a mathematically valid and well-defined process that could be rigorously understood and applied. In conclusion, Cauchy's work on the conditions for convergence of infinite series and his definition of an integral were foundational in establishing rigor and clarity in the field of mathematics. His concepts, from the Cauchy criterion to the definite integral, remain essential components of modern analysis, and Cauchy's contributions to the field continue to be recognized and respected by mathematicians worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: I was one of the best fingerprint examiners in the world. I could do things the FBI thought impossible. I could memorize fingerprints. The nearby agencies, including local offices of federal agencies that had their own labs, came to me for help. One day in a trial a new-hatched defence attorney tried to make me seem neglectful because I hadn't sent the prints from the crime scene to the FBI for verification. The FBI will not look at prints that have already been identified locally. I tried to get that across to him. Finally I said, “Sir, you don't understand. I don't ask the FBI for help. The FBI asks me for help.” The courtroom went dead silent. The lawyer choked a bit and looked frantically at the judge, who knew me quite well. The judge slowly nodded. The lawyer choked a few more times, said, “No further questions,” and returned to his seat. I was the only person in the five-state area in which the silver burglar was hitting who got him on fingerprint evidence. He never left fingerprint evidence . . . except when he did. Every other police agency quit looking, because his MO was unmistakable. We didn't. A detective got prints from a bamboo tree he had used to climb in a window, and I got several prints from items he had handled inside the house. After the trial he was being led back to the jail and I was walking down the hall. He stopped and said, “I want to talk to that lady.” The bailiff told him he couldn't talk to the witness, but I said I wanted to hear what he had to say. He said, “Lady, you're the smartest cop I ever saw, and I hope to God I never see you again.” I think that was the best compliment I ever got. I have other accomplishments.

Given the below context: On August 22, 2010 in rural Ohio, serial killer Edward Scarka is shot to death during a police raid of his farmhouse. At the time of Edward's death, married couple Sarah and John give birth to their son, Miles, in Pennsylvania. Miles shows extreme wisdom and intelligence from quite a young age, and begins speaking fluently before he is even a toddler. When Miles turns eight in 2018, Sarah and John begin noticing behavioral changes in him. One night he plays a prank on his babysitter Zoe, seriously injuring her, but claims no memory of the incident. Days later at school, he attacks a classmate with a wrench he obtains from the janitor's closet. Sarah brings Miles to psychologist Elaine Strasser, and also turns over a tape recording of Miles talking apparent gibberish in his sleep. Elaine gives the tape to a colleague, Arthur Jacobson, an expert on rebirth and reincarnation. Arthur reveals that the gibberish Miles spoke on the tape is in fact Hungarian, and that the words translate to \\"I'll cut your eyes out and watch you die, whore.\\" Unwilling to believe Arthur's assertion that an unsettled spirit is vying for control of Miles's body, Sarah dismisses him.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant. I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which P.D. took a more efficient approach in fighting crime? Answer:","completion":"To determine which police department (P.D.) took a more efficient approach in fighting crime based on the information provided, it's important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Greenville P.D. chose not to invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. This might have allowed them to allocate more resources to other types of law enforcement, potentially increasing their ability to deal with a larger number of criminals. However, the lack of technology and advanced forensic methods could limit their success in solving cases, particularly complex ones. On the other hand, Grayville P.D. invested heavily in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. These tools can greatly increase the department's ability to solve cases and apprehend criminals, particularly in cases where traditional methods of investigation might not be as effective. However, the high cost of these technologies may have resulted in less funds being available for other types of law enforcement, potentially increasing the number of criminals not being dealt with. To accurately answer the question, one would need more information on the actual crime rates, clearance rates, and other relevant performance metrics in both Greenville and Grayville. With such data, a comparison of the efficiency of each approach could be made. Without this additional information, it's impossible to definitively say which P.D. took a more efficient approach in fighting crime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person for whom Roy said her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat? from the following article ? Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess. Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Ferrier's association...","completion":"The last name of the person for whom Roy said her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat is Henderson.

Nach dem 8-stündigen Flug von Zentraleuropa nach Mombasa dauert der Bustransfer zum Diani Sea Lodge Hotel noch etwa eine Stunde.

Translate this to English?","completion":"After an eight-hour flight from Central Europe to Mombasa, the bus transfer to the Diani Sea Lodge Hotel takes about an hour. At the Diani Beach, there was quite a lot of wind, leading to considerable waves. The above passage describes a journey from Central Europe to a specific location in Kenya. Starting the journey with a long flight suggests that the location is quite a distance away from the starting point. The duration of the bus transfer indicates that the hotel could be located a significant distance from the Mombasa airport. Next, the setting changes from the journey to the destination where the hotel is situated, specifically at Diani Beach. We can infer from the description that Diani Beach could have a windy environment because the text describes a considerable presence of wind at that location. Additionally, the strong winds cause large waves along the shore of the beach. Going into more detail, the text could imply that this windy condition is either normal or abnormal for Dian Beach, however, no information is specified to support either implication. Regardless, the windy condition seems to influence the water's behavior, causing large or rough waves in the ocean adjacent to the beach. In conclusion, the excerpt is a brief account of a journey from Central Europe to Diani Sea Lodge Hotel, and the environmental condition at Diani Beach. Although brief, the text provides sufficient information to imagine the journey and the setting. The duration of the travel indicates the distance covered, while the wind and waves at the beach offer a glimpse into the natural environment and possible weather conditions of the destination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. We like to support locally owned businesses, but some local establishments make it so difficult for us to do so. My wife and I went for lunch and ordered a sandwich (Lucca: Herb roasted turkey) and a bruschetta plate (Burnt Mozzarella & Pesto: Wild Mushroom: & Caramelized Red Onion & Fig Tapenade). FYI, there is no table service so you have to order at the counter. I will say that the staff was friendly, so that's the positive, though there should have been more staff working the counter because it got backed up. The sandwich tasted OK, but the presentation was unimaginative, the bread not fresh (so dry it was falling apart) and the portions smaller than similarly priced fare fare from other establishments we frequent. Frankly, the best thing on our sandwich plate was the potato chips! The bruschetta was laughable! For 6.99 we received 3 SMALL slices of bread that were only partially covered with a visually unappetizing mix of toppings. The bread was not adequately toasted so each piece was somewhat soggy. In addition, none of the toppings were warm, even though the cheese on two pieces was melted and the third topped with what we would describe as a chunky mushroom paste (that was claimed as served hot)... which led us to believe these items are prepared in advance and not to order, hence the cool temp and soggy bread. Seriously! 6.99 for 3 small slices? Haven't the owners ever been to Postino to see what presentation, flavor and value are all about. Check the photo link in my profile and you'll find the one I posted of QCOM's sorry excuse for a bruschetta plate. And to all of you who will argue \\"but the Postino Bruschetta is 13.50\\"! Yes, it's nearly double the price, but at Postino you receive: A) 4 LARGE pieces of bruschetta, cut into thirds for 12 slices total, each slice about the size of one QCOM bruschetta; B) Easily triple the amount of toppings on each piece: C) something flavorful that you'll actually enjoy eating; D) A beautiful presentation; E) Table service from friendly, knowledgeable staff. Don't get me wrong. I think it's great that the Rea Family has brought a fine range of olive oils and related products to Arizona and we have used their oils in our home kitchen. Unfortunately, the del Piero eatery is operated more like a tourist destination where they figure it's a \\"one shot\\" opportunity to get maximum return for minimum investment from customers who probably won't be returning. Our suggestion, take the tour, buy some olive oil... then go somewhere else for lunch where they have taken the care to give you superior ingredients, prepared with skill, in sufficient quantity to justify the price and with friendly efficient service to boot. Oh yeah... as for the Gelato. Don't bother. Go to Frost at San Tan if you want a real, authentic, phenomenal Gelato experience This comment for the owners: While we were waiting for our lunch we went over to the wine tasting area. The young lady hosting the tasting was very pleasant and outgoing, but when we heard her say the Pinot Gris was made from white Pinot Noir grapes we, and the other couple tasting at the time, realized we wouldn't get an education with our tasting. To QCOM and all other establishments doing tastings... please, please, please don't have a wine novice doing the pouring.

And, in exchange, you could have a cheap vacation anywhere in the world. Just picture the scene: you're watching the sunset from the balcony of a Caribbean island house. It's large. And it's free as long as you don't mind the owners living in your home at the same time. All you need to be a home-swapper is the Internet and a rough idea of when and where you want to go on holiday. When you find someone whose dates match yours, and who wants to visit your area, you're all set to swap. The advantages are numerous: you can save a fortune in accommodation cost. You could get to use the owners' car, boat, bikes, pool or gym. You might even be able to come to an arrangement about looking after each other's pets! You also get to live like a local, and you might be invited around to neighbors' homes for tea, barbecues and tips on the area. People say that these cultural experiences are the memories that last. Plus, instead of one tiny hotel room, you have an entire house where you can make yourself at home. And it's not cold and impersonal like a hotel room. Of course, there are disadvantages. A lot of effort and communication are needed before the arrangements are finalized. Nobody wants a stranger living in their house, sleeping in their bed and using their bathroom, so you have to get to know each other well beforehand. Some people are concerned about theft or property damage, but in reality this is very rare. Most home-exchangers have the view that \\"If they can trust me with their house, I can trust them with mine.\\" The worse complaint people have is the difference in standards of cleanness.

Firstly, the reviewer states that the food quality was below average, indicating dissatisfaction with the meal. They specifically mention the adventure spicy being less than medium, implying that the dish was not as flavorful or spicy as they would have preferred. The mention of the Tom ka soup and beef pad Thai serves to provide specific examples of the dishes they found lacking in quality. Secondly, the reviewer explicitly states that they would not recommend the restaurant, which is a clear indicator of a negative review. The dissatisfaction with the food is enough to make them dissuade others from dining at the establishment. Lastly, the restaurant's atmosphere and employee behavior are called into question, with a description of employees being reprimanded for incorrect usage of the credit card machine. This indicates that the management was not effective in handling employee training or addressing issues privately. The fact that these issues were happening in the presence of customers adds to the negative impression of the establishment, as it shows a lack of professionalism and organization.

Movie plot title: The Dentist Movie plot: Dr. Alan Feinstone is a successful dentist. However, everything changes on the day of his wedding anniversary, when he discovers his wife Brooke is cheating on him with the poolman, Matt. After they finish, Alan retrieves his pistol and follows Matt in his car. He is led to Paula Roberts's house, a friend of Brooke's. Alan invents a story about a surprise party for Brooke and watches Paula invite Matt inside. Paula's dog attacks Alan, and he shoots it in self-defense. After returning to his car, he drives to work. At his dental practice, Alan's first appointment goes poorly when he hallucinates a child has rotten teeth and accidentally stabs him. As Detective Gibbs investigates the death of Paula's dog, Alan sees his second patient, April Reign, a beauty queen. Alan hallucinates she is his wife, and, while she is unconscious, takes off her pantyhose and fondles her before choking her. As she wakes, Alan snaps out of it and hides her pantyhose. Alan tells his manager, Steve Landers, she is still dizzy from nitrous oxide. When Steve realizes what really happened, he returns, punches Alan, and threatens a lawsuit. Alan ends the day early and sends his staff and patients home, including Sarah, a teenager who wants to have her braces removed. Later that night, Brooke meets Alan at a new opera-themed room at his practice. After sedating her under the premise of cleaning her teeth, he pulls out her teeth and cuts off her tongue. Detective Gibbs and his partner Detective Sunshine arrive at Alan's house the next morning to ask him questions. After the policemen leave, Matt discovers Brooke, who is still alive but sedated. Alan stabs Matt to death. Sarah and Paula are waiting for Alan at his practice. Alan sees Paula first, much to Sarah's disappointment. When Paula's conversation turns to how good a job Matt does for her, Alan overly-aggressively drills into her tooth, destroying it. His assistant, Jessica, questions what he is doing, and he snaps out of it. Alan asks Jessica to finish for him, but after he discovers...
