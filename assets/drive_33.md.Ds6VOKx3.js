You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: So this thing happened today. I am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads. BTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month. (Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did Diamond Masi live in the slums Options: - she was poor - not enough information - she was born there - her relatives were there Answer:","completion":"The correct answer to the question \\"Why did Diamond Masi live in the slums?\\" is: - she was poor From the information provided in the context, it is evident that Hira Masi (Diamond Masi) lived in the slums due to her financial situation. She is described as \\"extremely poor\\" and earns money by working as a sweeper for the society, where her salary is collected on a house-to-house basis. Additionally, the members of the society also help her with food, clothes, and occasional monetary bonuses due to her poverty. Though the context does not provide information regarding whether she was born there or if her relatives live there as well, it is clear that her poverty is the primary reason for her residence in the slums."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Image copyright Julia Quenzler Image caption Brady last appeared before a mental health tribunal in 2013 Moors Murderer Ian Brady has been refused permission to launch a High Court fight to have the lawyer of his choice represent him at a tribunal. Brady, who lost a bid to move from a secure hospital to a prison at a mental health review in 2013, wanted to challenge a ban on Robin Makin representing him at a future tribunal. Mr Makin's solicitors' firm, E Rex Makin & Co, is not a member of the Law Society's mental health panel. The case was dismissed as \\"unarguable\\". Sitting at London, Mr Justice Morris said Brady's challenge had \\"no realistic prospect of success\\". He added that nothing in the European Convention on Human Rights or in case law \\"supports the proposition that in civil proceedings... there is a right to publicly-funded representation for a lawyer of choice\\". Image caption Solicitor Robin Makin has represented Brady in the past At the 2013 mental health review tribunal in Manchester, 79-year-old Brady asked to be moved to a Scottish prison from Merseyside's Ashworth Hospital so he could not be force-fed and could be allowed to die if he wishes. The request was rejected after medical staff said Brady had chronic mental illness and needed continued care at the secure unit. Brady refused to take part in a further review in September 2016 on the grounds that Mr Makin could not be involved. Under legal aid rules, only members of the Law Society's mental health panel are entitled to a publicly-funded contract. ||||| Margaret Thatcher intervened to keep the Moors murderers in prison and dubbed their crimes “the most hideous and evil in modern times”, The Telegraph can reveal. A new archived document never before seen in public has been uncovered showing the Tory prime minister demanding the killers stayed incarcerated for “ever”. Mrs Thatcher also ordered extra security for Ian Brady when he was being transferred into a new prison “to make doubly sure that this maniac cannot escape”. ||||| Serial killer took action after his solicitor was denied legal aid contract to represent him in attempt to move to a Scottish prison Moors murderer Ian Brady has been refused permission to launch a high court battle to get a lawyer of his choice to represent him at a tribunal. Brady applied to launch what his lawyers described as a “totally unique” legal case after his solicitor of more than 25 years, Robin Makin, was denied a legal aid contract to represent him in his attempt to move to a Scottish prison. In 2013, the serial killer, 79, who now uses the name Ian Stewart-Brady, appeared before the mental health review tribunal asking to be moved to a prison in Scotland – where he was born and brought up – so he would not be force fed and could be allowed to die. Scottish prisons do not force feed inmates. His request to transfer was rejected after Ashworth hospital on Merseyside – where he is currently a patient – said he had chronic mental illness and needed continued care. A further review of the case was scheduled to take place in September last year, but Brady refused to take part unless his lawyer of choice could represent him. Brady and Myra Hindley were convicted of luring children and teenagers to their deaths. The couple’s victims were sexually tortured before being buried on Saddleworth Moor. Hindley died in hospital, still a prisoner, in November 2002 at 60. Makin is currently barred from acting as Brady’s publicly funded legal representative because his solicitors’ firm, E Rex Makin & Co, is not a member of the Law Society’s mental health panel. Under legal aid rules, only members are entitled to a publicly funded contract in the mental health law category. After a hearing held in London last week, Justice Morris on Monday dismissed Brady’s application for permission to seek judicial review, ruling that it had “no realistic prospect of success”. Morris said nothing in the European convention on human rights or in case law supported “the proposition that in civil proceedings, in particular proceedings related to detention on the grounds of mental health, there is a right to publicly funded representation for a lawyer of choice”. Brady’s legal team, who say the prisoner has been bedridden for the last couple of years, argued that the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, should use her powers to “make arrangements” in the case because it was so unique. However, Morris said it would not be a “lawful and proper use of her power” for her to intervene. Lawyers acting for Brady have described him as terminally ill. “He is in very poor physical health – he suffers from emphysema and has constant oxygen and a nebuliser four times a day,” they said. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A man named Ian Brady, who did some very bad things a long time ago, wanted a certain lawyer to represent him at a special meeting called a tribunal.

He loved to play outside in his garden, just like many other kids do. But on a sad Monday, something really bad happened that made a lot of people very sad. Billy was playing on a rope swing in his garden. A rope swing is a fun thing that hangs from a tree and lets you swing back and forth. But while Billy was playing, he got caught in the rope and couldn't get free. This was a very dangerous and scary situation. Some people who help keep us safe, called the police, heard about what happened to Billy. They came as fast as they could to help, but sadly, they couldn't save him. Billy passed away, which means his body stopped working, and he won't be able to play or do anything anymore. When someone we care about passes away, it makes us feel very sad and we miss them a lot. The police are now trying to find out what exactly happened to Billy. They want to know why this accident happened and how it could have been so dangerous. They are going to look at Billy's body and try to learn more about what went wrong. This is called a post-mortem examination.

Faryl Smith (born 23 July 1995) is a British soprano who rose to fame after appearing on the second series of the ITV television talent show Britain's Got Talent in 2008. She received praise throughout the competition, and although the favourite to win after the second round, she finished outside the top three in the live final on 31 May. During the competition, she was tutored by singing coach Yvie Burnett and received offers from various record labels. After the show, she, unlike other finalists, did not sign with Simon Cowell's Syco, although she did appear on fellow finalist Andrew Johnston's debut album, One Voice. In July 2009 it was announced that Smith was hoping to release her second album later in the year. In an interview, she expressed surprise and pleasure that the label wanted her to do another album so soon after the first. In September, further details about the album were released, including its name, Wonderland, and planned release date, 30 November. Smith claimed that Faryl \\"was an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording\\", while Cohen, producer of both Faryl and Wonderland, said Smith had \\"matured as an artist since the first album and I have no doubt that once again, people will be astonished and moved by her performances\\". The album, which was recorded at Sarm Studios in Notting Hill, London, was completed in early October, and is loosely based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Wonderland was released on 30 November. To publicise the album, Smith appeared on numerous radio shows, as well as television appearances including Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and Sky News Sunrise. Wonderland was well received by critics; Paul Callan, reviewing the album for the Daily Express, described it as \\"a joy\\". He compared it to other Christmas albums, saying that \\"[t]oo many are tired, much-repeated carol selections.\\" He described Smith's \\"control, tone and warmth\\" as \\"very moving\\". Andy Gill, reviewing Wonderland for The Independent, gave a less positive review. He said that the influence of Alice in Wonderland was often hard to perceive and that Cohen and Smith had \\"sweetened the classical elements\\". However, he praised the arrangements of \\"Adiemus\\", \\"Barcarolle\\", \\"Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence\\" and \\"Blow The Wind Southerly\\", but noted that on tracks including \\"Close To You\\", \\"the lack of emotional weight is telling.\\" Overall, Gill gave Wonderland 3 out of 5. However, the album failed to perform as well as Faryl; it entered the British album charts at number 56 for the week ending 12 December before dropping to number 92 the following week and then out of the top 100. After Wonderland, Smith's contract with Universal ended, and she subsequently received less attention from the press. Smith described the break with the label as mainly her decision, as she needed to focus on her A levels, which would allow her to get to university, explaining in an interview that \\"It wasn't like it ended horribly.\\" Smith performed at the 2009 Royal Variety Performance in front of Queen Elizabeth II, where she sang \\"God Save the Queen\\" with The Soldiers. She later said that the experience, including subsequently meeting the Queen, as the highlight of her year. Smith also performed elsewhere with The Soldiers, including at St Paul's Cathedral and Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital. What is the purpose of Wonderland?","completion":"Wonderland is an album created by Faryl Smith, a British singer who became famous after participating in a TV show called Britain's Got Talent. The purpose of this album is to share her beautiful singing voice and her musical talents with people who enjoy listening to it.

Researchers think it is a relative of the endangered South Asian river dolphin, offering clues to the evolutionary history of modern species. The findings have been published in the journal open access PeerJ. The fossil, a partial skull about 22cm (9ins) long, was discovered in southeastern Alaska by geologist Donald J Miller. It then spent decades in the collection of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington DC. The dolphin swam in sub-arctic marine waters about 25 million years ago, according to the new study's authors Alexandra Boersma and Nicholas Pyenson, who are based at the Smithsonian. The specimen represents a new genus and species, they say, which has been named Arktocara yakataga. Based on the age of nearby rocks, the scientists estimated that Arktocara came from the late Oligocene epoch, around the time that ancient whales diversified into two groups - the baleen whales, which include blue whales and humpbacks, and the toothed whales, which include sperm whales, porpoises and dolphins. By studying the skull and comparing it to those of other dolphins, both living and extinct, the team determined that A. yakataga is a relative of the South Asian river dolphin Platanista. This living dolphin is the last survivor of a once-widespread group. The skull confirms that Platanista belongs to one of the oldest lineages of toothed whales still alive today. \\"One of the most useful ways we can study Platanista is... by looking at fossils that are related to it to try to get a better sense of where it's coming from,\\" said Ms Boersma. \\"Exactly how that once diverse and globally widespread group dwindled down to a single species in Southeast Asia is still somewhat a mystery, but every little piece that we can slot into the story helps.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"A very old extinct animal, which is like a special kind of dolphin, was discovered by looking at a skull that had been in a museum since 1951.

The Department of Energy grabs 21 million from Fisker Automotive The Fisker Karma has the looks of a Ferrari or Lamborghini, a celebrity clientele that includes Leonardo DiCaprio and teen heart-throb Justin Bieber, and much of the green-minded eco credential of a Toyota Prius. Yet the fate of this seductive plug-in hybrid sedan could soon have more in common with the departed DeLorean Motor Company, considering the automaker’s mounting financial problems. Justin Bieber had his Fisker Karma chromed, and then pulled over by the Los Angeles police on at least two occasions. Yet financially troubled Silicon Valley-based Fisker Automotive needs much more than a celebrity-fueled jolt of publicity to get it out of its current predicament. Burning cash and in desperate search for some form of automotive alliance – or someone to simply buy the company outright – Fisker finds itself in the crosshairs of the U.S. Department of Energy, which forcibly recovered 21 million as partial repayment of roughly 200 million worth of outstanding U.S. government loans. PHOTOS: AMERICA'S GAS-FREE FUTURE Those loans were part of an eco-themed initiative intended to boost fledgling companies with a dedicated green initiative. As reported by Reuters, Fisker presently owes the U.S. government about 192 million of the 529 million loan it received from the DOE in 2009. That’s a big check to pay for any auto company, much less a boutique brand with one luxury-based model in its lineup. Granted, the high price of the Karma sedan narrows its overall sales pool but, much like the majority of A-list celebs, this plug-in hybrid doesn’t lack anything in the looks department. RELATED: STEVEN TYLER SHOWS OFF HIS 1.1 MILLION HENNESSEY VENOM GT SPYDER The Karma has the lines of a dedicated supercar, thanks to its wildly curvaceous fenders and ground-hugging stance – though some have suggested the front grille bears a striking resemblance to a waxed moustache. Under the curvaceous hood is a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, coupled to a pair of electric motors which are powered by a lithium-ion battery pack. The Karma is capable of running solely on electric power for approximately 30 miles and, once that point is reached, the gasoline-fed engine functions as an onboard generator for a total driving range of 230 miles. RELATED: SOCCER STAR CRISTIANO RONALDO'S DAMAGED FERRARI SET TO SELL ON EBAY Fisker prefers to quote the EPA’s combined gasoline and electric-only driving formula of 52 MPGe. Yet when functioning purely in gas-powered format, the Karma’s 20-mpg average is not even half of that impressive sounding figure. The company had hoped to introduce a smaller, cheaper model called the Atlantic, along with variations of the Karma that included a gorgeous convertible and sleek station-wagon. These plans, along with the fate of the entire company, are now on exceedingly shaky ground. ||||| Article Excerpt For a few months in 2012, Bruce Simon, the chief executive of gourmet food retailer Omaha Steaks International Inc., drove a 100,000 plug-in hybrid electric car known as the Fisker Karma. No longer. Mr. Simon says his car broke down four times over the span of a few months. Each time, Fisker Automotive Inc. picked it up and sent it by trailer from his home in Omaha, Neb., to a dealer in Minneapolis. The Karma was \\"so vulnerable to software errors, and the parts used were of such poor quality that eventually I insisted they take the car back and ... ||||| Newly released documents show that the Obama administration was warned as early as 2010 that electric car maker Fisker Automotive Inc. was not meeting milestones set up for a half-billion-dollar government loan, nearly a year before U.S. officials froze the loan after questions were raised about the company's statements. An Energy Department official said in a June 2010 email that Fisker's bid to draw on the federal loan might be jeopardized for failure to meet goals established by the Energy Department. Despite that warning, Fisker continued to receive money until June 2011, when the DOE halted further funding. The agency did so after Fisker presented new information that called into question whether key milestones _ including launch of the company's signature, 100,000 Karma hybrid _ had been achieved, according to a credit report prepared by the Energy Department. The December 2011 credit report said \\"DOE staff asked questions about the delays\\" in the launch of the Karma \\"and received varied and incomplete explanations,\\" leading to the suspension of the loan. Fisker had received a total of 192 million of the 529 million loan before it was suspended. In the June 2010 email, Sandra Claghorn, an official in DOE's loan program office, had written that Fisker \\"may be in limbo due to a lack of compliance with financial covenants\\" set up by the Energy Department to protect taxpayers in the event of default. Another document, from April 2010, listed milestones that Fisker had not yet met. Aoife McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said the June 2010 email was taken out of context. \\"The document shows that one person at a meeting discussed the possibility that Fisker might not meet a financial commitment\\" required by the Energy Department, McCarthy said in an email late Tuesday. DOE received the needed certification five days later and subsequently made the loan payment, she said. The Associated Press obtained the Fisker documents ahead of a House hearing scheduled for Wednesday on the federal loan to the troubled car maker, which has laid off three-fourths of its workers amid continuing financial and production problems. The potential loss of 171 million would be largest loss of federal loan money since the 2011 failure of solar panel maker Solyndra, which declared bankruptcy and laid off all its workers after receiving a 528 million loan from the Energy Department. The Energy Department seized 21 million from Fisker this month as it continued to seek repayment from the car maker for the 2009 loan. A payment from Fisker was due Monday, but was not made, a DOE official said. Henrik Fisker, the company's namesake and founder, was scheduled to testify at Wednesday's hearing. Fisker, who was forced out as CEO as the company's troubles mounted, said in prepared testimony that he remained proud of the company's \\"cutting edge technology,\\" which he said could \\"pave the way for a new generation of American car manufacturing.\\" Fisker has not built a vehicle since last summer and has failed to secure a buyer as its cash reserves have dwindled. ___ Follow Matthew Daly on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The Fisker Karma, a plug-in hybrid sedan with a celebrity clientele that includes Leonardo DiCaprio and Justin Bieber, has found itself in financial turmoil.

Washington's introduction to surveying began at an early age through school exercises that taught him the basics of the profession, followed by practical experience in the field. His first experiences at surveying occurred in the territory surrounding Mount Vernon. His first opportunity as a surveyor occurred in 1748 when he was invited to join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir. Fairfax organized a professional surveying party to lay out large tracts of land along the border of western Virginia, where Washington gained invaluable experience in the field. Washington began his professional career in 1749 at the age of 17, when he was appointed county surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia. He subsequently received a commission and surveyor's license from the College of William & Mary. He completed his first survey in less than two days, plotting a 400-acre parcel of land. He was subsequently able to purchase land in the Shenandoah Valley, the first of his many land acquisitions in western Virginia. For the next four years, Washington worked surveying land in Western Virginia for the Ohio Company, a land investment company funded by Virginia investors. He came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of Virginia Robert Dinwiddie, thanks to Lawrence's position as commander of the Virginia militia. In October 1750, Washington resigned his position as an official surveyor, though he continued to survey professionally for two more years before receiving a military appointment as adjutant for southern Virginia. By 1752, Washington completed close to 200 surveys on numerous properties totaling more than 60,000 acres. He continued to survey at different times throughout his life and as late as 1799.

Answer:","completion":"The second bridge to be built over the River Thames in central London was the Blackfriars Bridge, whose construction was officially completed in 1769. However, before diving into its details, it is important to note that the very first bridge, known as the London Bridge, was initially a wooden bridge built by the Romans in the first century AD. Over time, it went through several reconstructions and modifications, eventually becoming a stone bridge that stood as the sole pathway across the river for over a millennium. However, during the 18th century, due to growing population, urbanization and the expansion of businesses, there was a rising need for another bridge as the London Bridge became insufficient to handle the increased flow of people and goods. As a result, discussions and proposals for a new bridge at Blackfriars began. The name \\"Blackfriars\\" stems from the historic presence of the Dominican monastery, also called \\"Blackfriars,\\" which had been a focal point of the area in the medieval period. The attire of the Dominican order and their robes had a black mantle or cloak, hence the name \\"Black Friars.\\" The bridge was to be constructed as an access point between the expanding areas of Blackfriars and the City of London on the north side and the growing borough of Southwark on the south side. The Blackfriars Bridge was designed by architect Robert Mylne, who won a competition held to select the best possible design for the new bridge. Mylne's design was an elegant, somewhat elliptical structure with nine semi-elliptical arches of Portland stone, which was commissioned by the City Corporation. The construction process was relatively smooth, though the engineers faced technical challenges, such as constructing strong foundation bases on the shifting soil and clay around the riverbed. To overcome these challenges, they used innovative engineering techniques of that time, including the use of timber piles that were driven into the riverbed to provide sufficient support. The bridge officially opened to the public in 1769, and its formal name was the William Pitt Bridge, named after Britain's prime minister, though the name \\"Blackfriars Bridge\\" became more widely used and is what it is still known as today. The bridge not only significantly improved the connectivity within London, but it also served as a symbol of technological and engineering advancements of its time. It became an important transportation hub and fostered economic growth, commercial expansion, and increased accessibility for London residents and travelers. However, the original bridge faced issues due to its deteriorating condition and weakening structure as it aged. As a result, in 1860, a new iron bridge designed by engineer Joseph Cubitt was constructed to replace the original stone bridge. The new Blackfriars Bridge, completed in 1869, was sturdier and wider than its predecessor, with five cast-iron arches that spanned a total length of 923 feet. This new bridge is the one that stands today, and it remains a crucial transportation link in central London, with its nearest neighbors being the modern Millennium Bridge and the Southwark Bridge, all spanning across the mighty River Thames."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Tories making 'monumental mistake' with lopsided cuts, says Nick Clegg Nick Clegg has warned that George Osborne is in danger of making a \\"monumental mistake\\" after the chancellor said that about half of a further £25bn in spending cuts after the next general election would come from the welfare budget. In a sign of how coalition relations will remain fractious until the election in May 2015, the deputy prime minister said the chancellor's plans to target cuts on the working age poor were lopsided and unbalanced. Speaking at his monthly press conference in Whitehall, Clegg said: \\"You've got a Conservative party now who are driven, it seems to me, by two very clear ideological impulses. One is to remorselessly pare back the state – for ideological reasons just cut back the state. \\"Secondly – and I think they are making a monumental mistake in doing so – they say the only people in society, the only section in society, which will bear the burden of further fiscal consolidation are the working-age poor.\\" Signalling how he will waste no time in lambasting Tory plans over the next 16 months, Clegg later added: \\"I literally don't know of a serious economist who believes that you only do it from that lopsided, unbalanced approach. Almost all, serious economists say you have some kind of mix.\\" The deputy prime minister criticised his cabinet colleague after the chancellor warned of a further £25bn of cuts after the next electionthe chancellor warned of a further £25bn of cuts after the next election, targeting council housing for the better-off and housing benefit for under-25s. In a grim message to start the new year, Osborne said Britain was facing a year of hard truths in 2014 as there were more cuts to make and the economy still had big underlying problems. He said he expected the biggest chunk of the savings – around £12bn – to come from welfare in the two years after the election, as it would be an odd choice to leave this \\"enormous budget … untouched\\". Benefits for the young and people of working age would be considered before any cuts to pensioner benefits such as free bus passes and television licences, the chancellor said. The move forms part of Osborne's pledge to run a budget surplus by 2019 if the Conservatives are returned to power at the next election. The Treasury spends £1.9bn on housing benefit for 350,000 people under the age of 25, of whom about half have dependent children. In a speech in the Midlands on Monday morning, Osborne said there was still a long way to go before recovery as he set out a five-point plan to help the economy. \\"We've got to make more cuts – £17bn this coming year, £20bn next year, and over £25bn further across the two years after. That's more than £60bn in total.\\" Osborne built on previous warnings about the need to intensify austerity, on top of billions of pounds of existing cuts, even though the economy appears to be turning a corner. In the speech, he said the job of fixing the economy was \\"not even half done\\". \\"That's why 2014 is the year of hard truths,\\" he said. Clegg has agreed spending plans with Osborne for the first year after the general election and a target to eliminate the budget structural deficit by 2017-18. But in a taste of one of the main election battles – over the means by which the deficit should be cut – Clegg said it was wrong of the chancellor only to highlight the welfare bill for cuts, although Osborne did not say that the proposed £25bn savings would all come from welfare savings. Clegg also said the chancellor was wrong to play down the need for further tax rises. The deputy prime minister said: \\"Where the British people want a future British government to be is in the liberal centre ground where you say, yes of course, you need to finish the job of clearing the decks fiscally, of completing the job of filling the black hole – the so-called structural deficit – by the financial year 2017-18. To that extent the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives are co-authors of fiscal responsibility in setting out that timetable and that plan. \\"But – here is the big difference with the Conservatives – we believe the way in which you finish that job should be done fairly. \\"There are different ways in which you do that. There is Whitehall waste in spending which you continue to bear down on. There is of course further welfare reform, which will always be driven by the need to sharpen the incentives to work. And, yes, there is asking people with the broadest shoulders to make a contribution. That is why I remain perplexed that the Conservatives still refuse to countenance any change in the tax system to ask people occupying very high value properties to make a small, additional contribution to this effort.\\" Clegg's remarks show that the Liberal Democrat manifesto for the next election will include a \\"mansion tax\\" on properties worth more than £2m. But the Lib Dems will also include the \\"triple lock\\" on pensions – increasing them annually in line with inflation, average earnings or 2.5%, whichever is highest. David Cameron said on Sunday that the Tories would guarantee the triple lock, one of the main features of the Lib Dem manifesto in 2010, until 2020. The chancellor's negative outlook forms part of his argument that people should vote Conservative to let the party \\"finish the job\\", rather than handing control back to Labour. However, Labour said more cuts were needed after 2015 because Osborne's \\"failure on growth and living standards since 2010 has led to his failure to balance the books\\". Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said the social security bill was rising under Osborne, but the best way to get it down for the long-term is to get people into work and build more homes. \\"The Tories should back our compulsory jobs guarantee for young people and the long-term unemployed. And in tough times it cannot be a priority to continue paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest five per cent of pensioners,\\" he said. \\"What we need is Labour's plan to earn our way to higher living standards for all, tackle the cost-of-living crisis and get the deficit down in a fairer way.\\"","completion":"Nick Clegg, a big leader in the UK, said that another big leader, George Osborne, might make a really big mistake. Osborne wants to make more cuts to the country's spending, which means they will spend less money on certain things.

Osborne believes the UK still has big problems in its economy, even though things are getting a little better. But Clegg thinks there should be other ways to fix these problems without making things too hard for certain people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What was the name of the person who Chafe concluded their party had not reached the island? is inside the article: Bartlett decided to send a team back to establish the exact location of the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: \\"We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land.\\" The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp. Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor's scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe. It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it., can you guess it ?

Answer the following question: My daughter went to see The Wild One recently and she commented that Marlon Brando was wearing jeans so long ago. Of course he helped set the trend, so that got me thinking about the link between films and trends in fashion. Fashion and films have gone hand in hand for long. The Wild One is a good example: it appeared in 1954, starring Brando. Dressed in a black leather motorcycle jacket, leather cap and jeans, he created a look which is still considered \\"cool\\" today. Everyone from Madonna to middle-aged men is seen wearing the classic leather motorcycle jacket. Another strong influence on fashion trends was Breakfast at Tiffany's, starring Audrey Hepburn. She made famous the simple black dress that looks perfect at either a cocktail party or just standing around an expensive department store like Tiffany's with a pastry and coffee in your hand, as Audrey Hepburn does in the film. She looks so elegant, wearing simple but beautiful dresses, big dark glasses and a string of pearls around her neck. Audrey Hepburn still influences women's fashion with her \\"Tiffany's look\\". In more modern times, the film star Uma Thurman created a major fashion trend when she appeared in the film Pulp Fiction, made in 1994. Her style was very simple. Her black trousers, crisp white shirt and hair style was copied by women in the world. Influencing fashion trends can often be about timing. The movie Memoirs of a Geisha came just in time to start a trend in Japanese fashion. It started the Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, who wore beautiful silk kimonos , and it won an Oscar for Costume Design. Many travel companies picked up on the trend and ran \\"geisha trips\\" to Japan. The film has also led to a regained interest in kimonos. It is now quite common to see young Japanese women wearing kimonos not just on traditional occasions, but at various social events. The fashion is also beginning to spread to western countries. What does the film Memoirs of a Geisha lead to? A) The popularity of the Chinese actress. B) The worldwide reading of Geisha stories. C) The recovery of interest in kimonos. D) The \\"geisha trips\\" to social events. Answer:","completion":"C) The recovery of interest in kimonos."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Coming off a divisional win at home over the Bills, the Patriots traveled to Paul Brown Stadium for a matchup with the Bengals. On the game's opening drive, the Patriots drove 66&#160;yards on 11 plays, stalling at the Bengals' 13-yard line before Gostkowski hit a 31-yard field goal. The Bengals' next drive would span five plays but only one yard, ending in a punt. After an exchange of punts, the Patriots began a drive from their own 35-yard line, but quickly advanced into Bengals territory on a 49-yard Morris run. Three plays later, Brady hit Vrabel on a 1-yard touchdown pass to extend the Patriots lead to 10-0. After a Bengals punt on the first play of the second quarter, the Patriots had the ball but found themselves in a 3rd-and-23 situation, when Brady was intercepted by Leon Hall at the Bengals' 35-yard line. The Bengals capitalized on the turnover, with Carson Palmer ending a five-play drive on a 1-yard touchdown pass to T. J. Houshmandzadeh. The Patriots responded by going on a 12-yard, 62-yard drive, finishing it with a 7-yard Moss touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 17-7. The Bengals managed to reach the Patriots' 20-yard line on their next possession, but a Samuel interception at the 2-yard line kept the Bengals from scoring at the end of the first half. The Bengals reached midfield on the opening drive of the third quarter before punting. From their own 19-yard line, the Patriots moved deep in Bengals territory after a 15-yard penalty was tacked onto a 16-yard Moss catch. A few plays later, Morris ran for his second touchdown of the night; the 7-yard run opened the Patriots lead to 24-7. The Bengals, though, continued to threaten the Patriots offensively, moving to the Patriots' 22-yard line before linebacker Tedy Bruschi tipped a third-down pass to force a 40-yard Shayne Graham field goal. The Patriots next drive spanned into the fourth quarter but a Morris run on third down from the Bengals' 13-yard line was stopped for a loss, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. Yet again, the Bengals moved into Patriots territory on their ensuing drive, but the Patriots defense prevented another touchdown and forced a 48-yard field goal, making the score 27-13. On the Patriots' next drive, a 23-yard Stallworth catch put the Patriots in Bengals territory, setting up a 14-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Moss. Down 34-13, the Bengals continued to move the ball with a 17-yard Houshmandzadeh catch on the next play, but Palmer's next pass attempt was intercepted by Randall Gay at the Patriots' 47-yard line. The Patriots then ran out the clock to end the game and bring their record to 4-0.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. I am facing a new situation today: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.

The public services watchdog has issued a critical report regarding the incident, raising concerns about the importance of properly addressing mental health concerns through emergency helplines and support systems. Step 1: Background information on NHS 24 - Briefly explain what NHS 24 is and its objectives (to provide round-the-clock health and medical advice to the public in the United Kingdom) - Highlight the critical role it plays in supporting people during emergencies and the responsibility it holds to provide accurate, effective guidance and support Step 2: Overview of the incident - Present a brief summary of the tragic incident in question (a distressed woman contacted NHS 24 for assistance, but after the call, she took her own life) Step 3: Watchdog's criticism on NHS 24's handling of the call - Discuss the public services watchdog's findings, which condemn the actions taken by NHS 24 during the phone call - Detail the ways in which NHS 24's response was deemed inappropriate or inadequate in this situation (e.g., insufficient support or guidance provided to the distressed woman) Step 4: Impact of the criticism and incident on public trust - Examine the potential consequences of this incident (e.g., if it erodes public trust in NHS 24 and its ability to effectively address mental health issues) - Emphasize the importance of maintaining the public's faith in national healthcare services, especially during times of mental health crisis Step 5: Importance of addressing mental health concerns - Discuss the rising prevalence of mental health issues and their impact on society - Emphasize the need for effective mental health support systems and swift access to appropriate care Step 6: Recommendations for improvement - Offer recommendations on how NHS 24 and similar helpline services can better address mental health concerns (e.g., implementing more rigorous training for call handlers, streamlining protocols) - Encourage public health officials to continually review and update mental health care practices and policies Conclusion: The public services watchdog's criticism of NHS 24's handling of a distressed woman's call serves as a stark reminder of the crucial role emergency helplines play in our society. As mental health concerns continue to impact countless lives, it is essential that public health services are held accountable for their actions and strive to improve their support systems to ensure that those in need are effectively guided and assisted.

Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. and the situation: A team of geologists studied two islands. Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and Small island that presented almost no seismic activity. Answer the following question: Which island displayed fewer seismic waves? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background and situation, the island that displayed fewer seismic waves is Small island. This conclusion is drawn from the information that Small island presented almost no seismic activity, which indicates that fewer seismic waves were generated and observed in comparison to Large island. Seismic activity is directly related to the presence of seismic waves, as these waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake's focus. As Large island had a lot of seismic activity, it can be inferred that there was a higher number of seismic waves associated with the earthquakes occurring on and around the island. The study of seismic waves helps geologists to understand Earth's interior and the composition of different materials beneath the surface. On Large island, with more seismic activity, geologists would have access to more data through the analysis of numerous seismic waves, enabling them to better comprehend the island's geological composition and potentially gain insights into the reasons for its increased seismic activity. On the other hand, Small island's lack of noticeable seismic activity would result in fewer seismic waves for geologists to analyze. This could make it more challenging to study the island's interior structure and composition based on seismic wave data alone. However, the absence of considerable seismic activity might also suggest a more stable geological framework beneath Small island or different geological processes occurring in comparison to Large island. In summary, Small island displayed fewer seismic waves due to its minimal seismic activity, providing geologists with less information to study the inner structure of the island compared to Large island, which exhibited abundant seismic activity and consequently a higher number of seismic waves."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Available choices: *No. *Yes. Answer:","completion":"No. The suggested answer \\"Raster to vector, an image conversion process\\" is not an accurate or comprehensive response to the question about \\"what is raster wiki.\\" It seems to be addressing a specific process involved in converting raster images to vector images, rather than focusing on the concept of raster images or explaining what raster wiki is. A more detailed and accurate answer would be: A raster image, also known as a bitmap, is a digital image represented by a grid of individual pixels or points of color. The term \\"raster\\" is derived from the process of scanning cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, which scan horizontally across the display to create images by varying the intensity of the electron beam. In the context of digital images, raster refers to the manner in which image data is stored and displayed, with each pixel having its own color value. Raster images are widely used in digital photography, video games, and graphic design due to their ability to represent complex and detailed images. However, raster images are resolution-dependent, which means that their quality can deteriorate when scaled up or down. This is because the pixel grid has a fixed size, and resizing the image requires new pixels to be interpolated, or guessed, based on the surrounding pixels. Raster wiki might refer to the concept of raster graphics from a Wiki source such as Wikipedia or another collaborative, user-edited platform. In this case, you can find information on raster graphics, their characteristics, and their applications in digital imaging. Depending on the wiki platform, you might also learn about file formats associated with raster images, such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF, as well as software programs that enable users to work with raster images like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, the character is still in a transition period--he is not drawn as elongated as he later was and his voice isn't quite right. In addition, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a little unusual. Elmer is some poor sap who buys Bugs from a pet shop--there is no gun or desire on his part to blast the bunny to smithereens! However, despite this, this is still a very enjoyable film. The early Bugs was definitely more sassy and cruel than his later incarnations. In later films, he messed with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started it--they messed with the rabbit.

What is the best way to: placemat","completion":"The best way to create and use placemats, whether you're designing them for a special occasion or for everyday use, involves considering the various aspects of placemats and following certain guidelines to achieve the desired aesthetics and functionality. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you understand, design, and utilize placemats effectively: 1. Determine the purpose: First, establish the primary purpose of the placemats. Are they intended for a special event, a specific theme, or everyday use? This will help you choose appropriate colors, materials, and designs to either match or enhance your table setting. 2. Choose the right material: Placemats are made from a variety of different materials, such as linen, cotton, vinyl, bamboo, paper, silicone, or cork. Each material has its own pros and cons: - Linen and cotton: These natural fiber options are soft, absorbent, and eco-friendly. They may be more suitable for formal settings or special occasions, as they have a more luxurious feel. They are also machine-washable and reusable. - Vinyl, silicone, and other synthetic materials: These are ideal for casual and outdoor settings, as they're easy to clean, waterproof, and usually stain-resistant. However, they can become damaged when exposed to high temperatures. - Bamboo and cork: Both materials offer a unique, natural look and are environmentally friendly. Bamboo placemats tend to be easy to clean with a damp cloth, while cork placemats provide a non-slip surface and heat resistance. 3. Consider size and shape: The standard placemat size is about 12x18 inches for rectangular or oblong placemats. However, placemats also come in round, square, and oval shapes to suit various table sizes and settings. Measure your table and ensure that the chosen placemat dimensions fit comfortably, leaving enough space between each setting. 4. Design and aesthetics: Whether you opt for solid colors, patterns, or themed designs, ensure that your chosen placemats complement your table setting, tableware, and overall décor. Consider the color scheme, textures, and styles of your dining area, and select placemats that either harmonize or contrast effectively with these elements. 5. Durability and maintenance: Opt for durable materials that can withstand regular wear and tear, especially if using them daily. It's also necessary to choose placemats that are easy to clean and maintain, saving you time and effort in the long run. 6. Layering and coordination: If desired, consider layering your placemats with coordinating elements such as tablecloths, chargers, and table runners. Layering adds depth, dimension, and visual interest to the table setting. 7. Proper placement: Place the placemats at each seat, typically one inch away from the table's edge, ensuring each guest has enough space to eat comfortably. Besides reflecting your style preferences, proper placement helps protect the table surface from spills, scratches, and heat. 8. Matching accessories: For a more cohesive look, consider coordinating your placemats with matching or complementary napkins, napkin rings, and tableware. This helps to create harmony and balance within the table setting. In conclusion, the best way to create and use placemats involves determining their purpose, choosing the right materials and size, considering the design and aesthetics, focusing on durability and maintenance, layering and coordinating when desired, placing them correctly, and accessorizing to create a cohesive look. By following these guidelines, you can ensure a visually appealing and functional placemat experience for any occasion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On 10 November 1509, Pizarro sailed from Spain to the New World with Alonso de Ojeda on an expedition to Uraba. He sailed to Cartagena and joined the fleet of Martin Fernandez de Enciso and, in 1513, accompanied Balboa to the Pacific. In 1514, he found a supporter in Pedro Arias Davila, the Governor of Castilla de Oro and was rewarded for his role in the arrest of Balboa with the positions of mayor and magistrate in Panama City, serving from 1519 to 1523. Reports of Peru's riches and Cortes's success in Mexico tantalized Pizarro. He undertook two expeditions to conquer the Incan Empire in 1524 and in 1526. Both failed as a result of native hostilities, bad weather and lack of provisions. Pedro de los Rios, the Governor of Panama, made an effort to recall Pizarro, but the conquistador resisted and remained in the south. In April 1528, he reached northern Peru and found the natives rich with precious metals. This discovery gave Pizarro the motivation to plan a third expedition to conquer the area. He returned to Panama to make arrangements, but the Governor refused to grant permission for the project. Pizarro returned to Spain to appeal directly to King Charles I. His plea was successful and he received not only a license for the proposed expedition, but also authority over any lands conquered during the venture. He was joined by family and friends and the expedition left Panama in 1530. When hostile natives along the coast threatened the expedition, Pizarro moved inland and founded the first Spanish settlement in Peru, San Miguel de Piura. Atahualpa refused to tolerate a Spanish presence in his lands, but was captured by Pizarro during the Battle of Cajamarca on 16 November 1532. A ransom for the emperor's release was demanded and Atahualpa filled a room with gold, but Pizarro charged him with various crimes and executed him on 26 July 1533, overriding his associates who thought he was overstepping his authority. The same year, Pizarro entered the Inca capital of Cuzco and completed his conquest of Peru. In January 1535, Pizarro founded the city of Lima, a project he considered his greatest achievement. Quarrels between Pizarro and his longtime comrade-in-arms Diego Almagro culminated in the Battle of Las Salinas. Almagro was captured and executed and, on 26 June 1541, his embittered son, Diego de Almagro \\"el mozo\\", assassinated Pizarro in Lima. The conquistador of Peru was laid to rest in the Lima Cathedral.

Q:David Gauntlett makes a good point in his newest book (Making Media Studies: The Creativity Turn in Media and Communications Studies) and that is that traditional forms of media studies are no longer applicable. Gone are the days of massive institutions and production companies, gone are the traditional audiences and simplistic texts. In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW. While universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980’s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself? David Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold’s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it’s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making. To borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold: 1. It’s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media. 2. There is an intent to move FORWARD rather than looking BACKWARDS at how things are. 3. It’s aims are TRANSFORMATIONAL rather than DOCUMENTARY.

This article: Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\". Time magazine speculated that \\"the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 4.1 billion\\".

A Washington state grandmother could lose an eye after she bravely rescued her grandson who was being viciously attacked by an otter as he swam in a river on Thursday. Roxane Leilani Grove's grandmotherly instinct kicked in as soon as she heard the screams of her 8-year-old grandson, Bryce Moser, and then saw the horrible sight of an otter biting him aggressively in a swimming hole in the Pilchuck River - about 30 miles northeast of Seattle. 'I could see that it was biting into his head and it had its claws around him,' Grove told KOMO News. Scroll down for video. Attacked: Roxane Leilani Grove and her grandson Bryce Moser, left, with their injuries from an otter attack at Pilchuck River, Washington. 'I just. swam out there and I grabbed the claws to pull it off of him. 'I just remember trying to hold it as tight as I can and yelling \\"Get. him out of the water! Get him out of the water!\\"' Grove managed to get young Bryce out of the water but not before suffering her own injuries. 'It just started biting on me and biting on me and it felt like little knives just going in,' Grove told the TV station. The. pair were taken to a hospital where Grove reportedly received hundreds. of stitches to her face and head as well as the eye injury and Bryce. received nine staples in his head. State. and federal wildlife agents in Washington are trying to trap the otter. and it will likely be killed unless it is a female with pups, because it. has pounced on people, said Capt. Alan Myers of the Washington. Department of Fish and Wildlife. 'We're doing everything possible to capture than animal as soon as possible,' Myers said Friday. 'This is an extremely rare incident. Otters are not known to be aggressive toward people.' The boy's mother, Tabitha Moser, saw the four-foot otter attack her son and her mother saved him. A state worker was unable to find the otter, so expert trappers were called in from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services, Myers said. They'll try to trap it with a foot snare or tranquilize it. 'We're not sure if it's a hyper-aggressive male protecting territory or a female protecting its young,' Myers said. An eight-year-old boy and his grandmother were attacked by an otter in Washington's Pilchuck River. 'There's a lot of liability in trying to relocate an animal that's been hyper-aggressive, and it would likely be euthanized. If it's a female with pups, there's another possible outcome if we can find a good location.' But the otter would have to be killed in any case so its brain could be tested for rabies, if that's a concern for doctors treating the boy and his grandmother, he said. 'There are no known cases of otter rabies in Washington,; he said. 'That's an extremely remote possibility.' The grandmother was treated at Harborview. Medical Center in Seattle and the boy at Providence Medical Center in. Everett, the boy's mother, Tabitha Moser told KING. The attack took place in Washington's Pilchuck River - about 30 miles northeast of Seattle (pictured) 'All of a sudden I just heard him scream for his life. He was just bobbing up and down in the water and as he came up there was something all the way on top of his head,' she told KING. The otter continued to attack as they left the water. 'Even after it got into the river and out of our way it stood on its hind legs looking at us like, 'Don't do it again; don't come in here,'' she told KING. Myers said he has not heard of any other otter attacks in Washington but there have been some around the country. Lake Conner Park has been closed, and signs have been posted along the Pilchuck River warning people to beware of the otter, Myers said. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

This allows for heat to be lost through radiation. Next, sweat glands become active to produce sweat, which is released from the pores onto the skin's surface. The moisture, or sweat, then evaporates, which requires energy in the form of heat. As a result, the heat is transferred from the body to the environment, cooling the body down.

The fumble was recovered by Texans defensive end Mario Williams for a touchdown. The Chiefs finally scored, through a field goal, with thirty seconds remaining in the third quarter. For the first ten minutes of play in the fourth quarter, the Texans controlled the ball and kept the Chiefs' offense off the field.

Radio waves have the longest wavelengths. They also have the least amount of energy. Infrared light has wavelengths too long for humans to see, but we can feel them as heat. The atmosphere absorbs the infrared light. Ultraviolet (UV) light is in wavelengths too short for humans to see. The most energetic UV light is harmful to life.

Write some highlights for the following article: A teenager has been suspended from school after teachers mistook her non-alcoholic shandy for a bottle of lager. Nikita Morrison, 13, was in a French lesson when she put the bottle of Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy on her desk while unpacking her school books. But teachers immediately confiscated the 500ml drink and within minutes she was sent home after being excluded for three days. Controversy: Nikita Morrison, 13, who has been suspended from Gloucester Academy for bringing in the drink. She claims staff at Gloucester Academy considered the soft drink to be alcohol - despite the product’s website stating it is suitable for children. The alcohol content of the drink is less than 0.5 per cent - not enough to legally qualify as an intoxicating liquor and it is sold in the soft drinks aisle in shops. Ms Morrison, who has never been excluded before, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. ‘You see kids at school drinking it all the time, even the Year 7s, there is nothing wrong with it. ‘The teachers told me I wasn’t allowed to bring it into school because it is lager. I told them it was pop but they just wouldn’t listen.’ Anger: Nikita's mother, Amanda (right), has described her suspension as 'absurd' and complained that she is now behind with her lessons. Ben Shaw’s Bitter Shandy contains 12 per cent beer but is sold in the soft drink aisle in shops. No ID is needed to buy it and it is officially classed as a soft drink by the UK Food Standards Agency. Her mother Amanda, 38, said the incident on Wednesday was ‘absolutely ludicrous’. ‘It is absurd, the staff were saying it was alcohol. ‘She has missed quite a few lessons now, it is ridiculous. She is special needs so she is dropping behind even more. Safe: The shandy that Ms Morrison brought into school contains less than 0.5 per cent alcohol and is sold in the soft drinks sections of shops. ‘It find it absolutely ludicrous that she is missing out on education because of a bottle of pop. ‘Despite the fact we have explained, and proven, that it is not alcohol the school won’t listen at all.’ The stay-at-home mum-of-nine added: ‘There is nothing wrong with taking that drink into school at all. ‘I tried to explain that it was my mistake and I bought it from the supermarket but that was not good enough.’ Alan Armstrong, interim headteacher at Gloucester Academy, defended the exclusion. He said: ‘This school and all schools never exclude a student lightly or for trivial reasons. Schools have a duty of care to ensure all students are kept safe.’ A Ben Shaw’s spokesman said: ‘Shandies with less than 0.5 per cent alcohol by volume are defined as soft drinks and as such have no restriction on their sale or consumption. ‘All products we manufacture under the shandy name are less than 0.5 per cent and this is stated on labelling.’ Highlights:","completion":"1. 13-year-old Nikita Morrison was suspended from Gloucester Academy after teachers mistook her non-alcoholic shandy for a bottle of lager. 2.

The Macintosh took 45 percent of operating profits in the PC industry during Q4 2012, compared to 13 percent for Dell, seven percent for Hewlett Packard, six percent for Lenovo and Asus, and one percent for Acer. While sales of the Macintosh have largely held steady, in comparison to Apple's sales of the iPhone and iPad which increased significantly during the 2010s, Macintosh computers still enjoy high margins on a per unit basis, with the majority being their MacBooks that are focused on the ultraportable niche that is the most profitable and only growing segment of PCs.

Elizabeth Masterson, a young emergency medicine physician whose work is her whole life, is in a serious car accident while on her way to a blind date. Three months later, David Abbott, a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth begin to bond, as much as that is possible, and he takes her out of town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has been there before, and in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 23-hour shift in the hospital. Together, assisted by a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl, Elizabeth and David find out who she is, what happened to her, and why they are connected. She is not dead, but in a coma, her body being kept on life support at the hospital where she used to work. When David discovers that in accordance with her living will, she will soon be allowed to die, he tries to prevent this by telling Elizabeth's sister, Abby, that he can see her and what the situation involves.

Title: A Cry in the Dark Movie plot: Seventh-day Adventist Church pastor Michael Chamberlain, his wife Lindy, their two sons, and their nine-week-old daughter Azaria are on a camping holiday in the Outback. With the baby sleeping in their tent, the family is enjoying a barbecue with their fellow campers when a cry is heard. Lindy returns to the tent to check on Azaria and is certain she sees a dingo with something in its mouth running off as she approaches. When she discovers the infant is missing, everyone joins forces to search for her, without success. It is assumed what Lindy saw was the animal carrying off the child, and a subsequent inquest rules her account of events is true.The tide of public opinion soon turns against the Chamberlains. For many, Lindy seems too stoic, too cold-hearted, and too accepting of the disaster that has befallen her. Gossip about her begins to swell and soon is accepted as statements of fact. The couple's beliefs are not widely practised in the country, and when the media reports a rumour that the name Azaria means \\"sacrifice in the wilderness\\" (when in fact it means \\"blessed of God\\"), the public is quick to believe they decapitated their baby with a pair of scissors as part of a bizarre religious rite. Law-enforcement officials find new witnesses, forensics experts, and a lot of circumstantial evidenceincluding a small wooden coffin Michael uses as a receptacle for his parishioners' packs of un-smoked cigarettesand reopen the investigation, and eventually Lindy is charged with murder. Seven months pregnant, she ignores her attorneys' advice to play on the jury's sympathy and appears emotionless on the stand, convincing onlookers she is guilty of the crime of which she is accused. As the trial progresses, Michael's faith in his religion and his belief in his wife disintegrate, and he stumbles through his testimony, suggesting he is concealing the truth. In October 1982, Lindy is found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, while Michael is found guilty as an accessory and given an 18-month...

But if the Fruitvale, B.C., resident is asked by U.S. border agents if he's ever smoked marijuana, he knows what he's going to do. \\"I'm going to lie,\\" he said Tuesday. Larocque lives just north of B.C.'s border with Washington state, a boundary he crosses several times a year to reach his winter home in Arizona.​ But a report Monday — about Estevan, Sask., residents being refused entry into North Dakota after admitting to past cannabis use — has Larocque spooked about his next southbound trip next month. \\"I don't want to lie. And I'm going to lie. And that is unfortunate. Because I am a truthful person and I think most Canadians are,\\" he said. Larocque is worried about getting cut off from his second home. Still, he should rethink his plan, say lawyers consulted by CBC News. \\"Do not do that. Trust me,\\" said Henry Chang, a partner at the Toronto law firm Blaney McMurtry LLP who specializes in immigration law and practises in both Ontario and California. The repercussions of being caught lying to a U.S. border agent outweigh the potential gain of fibbing without detection, Chang said — namely, you could be permanently banned from entering the U.S. 'People don't understand' the rules: lawyer There are two other things that could get you banned from the U.S. in the post-Canadian legalization age, according to Chang. The first is a prior conviction for marijuana possession. The second is admitting to having used marijuana before its recreational use was legalized by the Canadian government on Oct. 17. Henry Chang, an immigration lawyer based in Toronto, says people can refuse to answer the question and seek American legal advice in the meantime. (Blaney McMurtry LLP) \\"If you say, 'Yeah, I smoked marijuana when I was 18, but it's not a problem, right?' — it is problem. You are barred for life, as if you had been convicted back then. People don't understand that,\\" said Chang. \\"Legalization doesn't cure prior problems,\\" he added. Medical marijuana users with a valid prescription who admit to using the drug won't be banned, Chang said, though they still can't import any marijuana into the U.S. What about recreational users who admit to doing marijuana after it was legalized? \\"It's not as black and white,\\" said Chang. If it was a one-time tryout by a curious newbie involving cannabis bought from a legal Canadian seller, \\"you should be OK,\\" he said. Medically examined for signs of addiction But a person who admits to using cannabis repeatedly could still be barred from entering the United States, said Chang. \\"If they conclude that you're a drug abuser [or addict], you're barred [on] that ground, separate and apart from whether it's legal or not.\\" That conclusion can't be reached, however, until a Canadian panel physician approved by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) examines someone following a detention. \\"You will be temporarily banned until you get the medical exam done,\\" said Chang, adding that the findings are shared directly with CBP, not with the patient. \\"If they tell you [at your next border trip] you're not getting in, you know what the medical exam said,\\" he said. People barred on this ground aren't necessarily banned for life, however, thanks to what Chang called a \\"remission provision.\\" The panel physician (either in Vancouver, Toronto or elsewhere) may re-examine someone and find they no longer meet the definition of addict or abuser. \\"But it can bar someone for several years until they have proven that they no longer use drugs, including legal cannabis,\\" said Chang. Andrew Mason, a Saskatoon defence lawyer, said people with past convictions for pot possession can obtain a waiver but it's a costly and 'cumbersome' process. (CBC) People with a prior pot possession conviction have an option too. They can apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for a waiver (form I-192) that would essentially see the U.S. government overlook a past offence. People have to provide a criminal record check and references, pay a 1,200 Cdn fee and periodically get their waiver renewed. \\"It's a cumbersome process,\\" said Andrew Mason, a Saskatoon-based defence lawyer. And it's not to be confused with a pardon from the Canadian government, which may not do any good anyway, Mason added. \\"It doesn't erase the fact that you had committed the offence in the past.\\" Their advice? Delay Given all these strict rules, what should marijuana users do when questioned by border agents? \\"That's a question I get a lot,\\" said Chang. \\"It's a no-win situation for anyone who gets asked the question. \\"If you admit to using controlled substances prior to legalization, you are barred,\\" he continued. \\"If you lie and say you've never smoked it and they find out, it's a permanent bar for material misrepresentation, which is also quite serious.\\" Chang and Mason agree it's better to take a take a third, if imperfect, approach. Delay. \\"Refuse to answer the question. Say it's irrelevant. Say you don't know why this question is being asked,\\" said Chang. It won't get people to their destinations — and they'll merely be confronted with the same question next time — but at least they can consult a lawyer, he said. That lawyer may even be able to resolve the situation directly with CBP \\"without you having to make an actual admission,\\" said Chang. \\"Because once you've admitted it, it's done. You're barred. Nothing anybody can do except apply for a waiver.\\" A diplomatic solution Mason is hopeful another solution can be worked out. \\"I expect the governments of Canada and the U.S will get together and make it so that most people who have smoked it in the past but who are not likely to break U.S. drug laws will not be disallowed in the United States. \\"But that's going to take a bit of negotiation and discussion.\\" ||||| The Mayor of Estevan, Sask. is concerned that people trying to cross the border are being turned away for saying they have smoked marijuana in the past. “In a lot of cases people are being asked if they have smoked pot at the border and part of the problem is the people that have admitted to smoking and in some cases are being turned away, said Estevan Mayor Roy Ludwig. The mayor said he knows of a few cases already where people have been turned back and refused entry to the United States.

But Admitting To Using It Can Get You Banned From U.S. Enlarge this image toggle caption Brittany Greeson/The Washington Post/Getty Images Brittany Greeson/The Washington Post/Getty Images It's now legal for adults to smoke pot in Canada. But some Canadians have found themselves barred – possibly permanently – if they admit at the U.S. border that they have used marijuana. Estevan, Saskatchewan, is just 10 miles north of the border with North Dakota. The town's mayor, Roy Ludwig, told the CBC that residents have been turned away at the border for admitting to marijuana use. \\"It is a fairly serious concern,\\" Ludwig said. \\"Even people that might have smoked it 20, 30 years ago, they're being asked, 'Have you ever smoked cannabis?' when they get to the U.S. border. We understand some people have said yes, that they have, and have been turned back.\\" And the concern is not only that they won't be able to enter the U.S. once – but that they can be banned permanently. That's what happened to Bill Powers, a 57-year-old Canadian who has a medical marijuana license, The Los Angeles Times reported. Border agents asked if Powers had ever smoked pot before getting the license. When he said he had, he was labeled \\"inadmissible\\" and barred from entering the U.S. \\"I thought they were kidding,\\" he told the newspaper. \\"They're treating people like terrorists when all we did was admit to smoking some pot.\\" Customs and Border Protection was decidedly not kidding. Act 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act lists some 60 reasons why a non-U.S. citizen can be deemed ineligible to enter the the country. Those reasons range from being a money launderer to being a Nazi. A few of the reasons concern drugs, and can potentially apply at the border to non-U.S. citizens who admit to having used marijuana, depending on the situation. One blocks entry to noncitizens who are determined \\"to be a drug abuser or addict.\\" Another bars those who have been convicted of crimes involving controlled substances. A third bars those whom officers have reason to believe \\"is or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance.\\" CBP spokesperson Stephanie Malin tells NPR that \\"on the U.S. side, nothing has changed.\\" Despite legalization in a number of U.S. states and the District of Columbia, marijuana remains a controlled substance under federal law. She says that every inspection is different, and not everyone will be asked about drug use. \\"However, if during the course of the inspection, there is reason for the officer to ask about it, they will. ... It comes down to the intent of the travel.\\" In October, CBP issued a statement regarding Canadians working in that country's legal cannabis industry. Canadians working in that industry in Canada may only travel legally to the U.S. if their travel does not involve the marijuana business. The Canadian government warns travelers that the U.S. \\"has a zero-tolerance policy and imposes severe penalties for the possession of even a small amount of an illegal drug.\\" The CBC reports that the Canadian government \\"will post signs at border crossings warning Canadians not to bring their legal marijuana into the U.S. — just as the Americans do for their citizens with signs informing them of Canada's strict firearms regime.\\" The CBP doesn't track how many Canadian citizens have been barred from entering the U.S. for marijuana-related reasons. But Malin says that the CBP has \\"not seen a noticeable spike\\" in Canadians turned away at the border this year. Canadians who are barred from entering for having used marijuana in the past may apply for a waiver. But they can be costly and cumbersome to attain, and must be renewed every five years. Henry Chang, a partner at Toronto law firm Blaney McMurtry who specializes in immigration law, advises pot-smoking Canadians to neither admit to marijuana use, nor lie about it. \\"Refuse to answer the question. Say it's irrelevant. Say you don't know why this question is being asked,\\" Chang told the CBC. They won't be able to enter the U.S. on that occasion, he says, but they will be able to go and consult with a lawyer who may be able to resolve the situation. Asked if the CBP's stance might be too severe, Malin says that her agency is simply enforcing U.S. immigration law. And while the law could change, she says, there is no indication that the agency will change how it enforces the current law. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a brief explanation of the main points or main ideas in a story, article, or text.

Given the question: Information: - Herodium (Latin), Herodeion, best known in Israel as Herodion and in Arabic as Jabal al-Fureidis (lit. \\"Paradise Hill\\") is a truncated cone-shaped hill, located south of Jerusalem and southeast of Bethlehem, in the Judaean Desert, West Bank. Herod the Great built a palace fortress and a small town at Herodium, between 23 and 15 BCE, and is believed to have been buried there. Herodium is 758 meters (2,487 ft) above sea level, the highest peak in the Judaean Desert. Today, the site is managed by the Israel National Parks Authority. - The Second Temple was an important Jewish Holy Temple (\\"Beit HaMikdash HaSheni\\") which stood on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem during the Second Temple period, between 516 BCE and 70 CE. According to Jewish (and subsequently, Christian) tradition, it replaced Solomon's Temple (the First Temple), which was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, when Jerusalem was conquered and a portion of the population of the Kingdom of Judah was taken into exile in Babylon. - Antipater II ( Greek : ; c. 46 -- 4 BC ) was Herod the Great 's first - born son , his only child by his first wife Doris . He was named after his paternal grandfather Antipater the Idumaean . He and his mother were exiled after Herod divorced her between 43 BC and 40 BC to marry Mariamne I. However , he was recalled following Mariamne 's fall in 29 BC and in 13 BC Herod made him his first heir in his will . He retained this position even when Alexandros and Aristobulos ( Herod 's sons by Mariamne ) rose in the royal succession in 12 BC , and even became exclusive successor to the throne after their execution in 7 BC ( with Herod Philip I in second place ) . However , in 5 BC Antipater was brought before Publius Quinctilius Varus , then Roman governor of Syria , charged with the intended murder of his father Herod . Antipater was found guilty by Varus ; however , due to Antipater 's high rank , it was necessary for Caesar Augustus to approve of the recommended sentence of death . After the guilty verdict , Antipater 's position as exclusive successor was removed and granted to Herod Antipas . Once the sentence had approval from Augustus in 4 BC , Antipater was then executed , and Archelaus ( from the marriage with Malthace ) was made heir in his father 's will as king over Herod 's entire kingdom ( with Antipas and Philip as Tetrarchs over certain territories ) . We know two of Antipater 's wives through the writings of Josephus . First was his niece Mariamne III , daughter of Aristobulus IV. The second was a high - ranking Hasmonean princess whose first name is lost to history . She was the daughter of Antigonus the Hasmonean , the last Hasmonean king who also served as high priest . This wife of Antipater was also a first cousin of Mariamne I , renowned royal wife of Herod the Great . Josephus records that she was at the palace with Doris , Antipater 's mother , in support of her husband during his trial before Varus in 5 BC. - Aristobulus II was the Jewish High Priest and King of Judea, 66 BC to 63 BC, from the Hasmonean Dynasty. - Antipater I the Idumaean (died 43 BC) was the founder of the Herodian Dynasty and father of Herod the Great. According to Josephus, he was the son of Antipas (I) and had formerly held that name. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Judea or Judæa (from , \\"Yhuda\\", \\"Yhûh\\", , , \\"Yahudia\\") is the ancient biblical, Roman, and modern name of the mountainous southern part of Palestine. The name originates from the Hebrew, Canaanite and later neo-Babylonian and Persian name \\"Yehudah\\" or \\"Yehud\\" for the biblical Israelite tribe of Judah (Yehudah) and associated Kingdom of Judah, which the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia dates from 934 until 586 BCE. The name of the region continued to be incorporated through the Babylonian conquest, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods as Yehud, Yehud Medinata, Hasmonean Judea, and consequently Herodian Judea and Roman Judea, respectively. - Mariamne I (died 29 BCE), also called Mariamne the Hasmonean, was a Hasmonean princess and the second wife of Herod the Great. She was known for her great beauty, as was her brother Aristobulus III. Herod's fear of his rivals, the Hasmoneans, led to him executing all of the prominent members of the family, including Mariamne. - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. - Titus Flavius Josephus (37 100), born Joseph ben Matityahu (Hebrew: , \\"Yosef ben Matityahu\\"; Greek: ), was a first-century Romano-Jewish scholar, historian and hagiographer, who was born in Jerusalemthen part of Roman Judeato a father of priestly descent and a mother who claimed royal ancestry. - The Herodian Dynasty was a Judean dynasty of Idumaean/Edomite descent. The Herodian dynasty began with Herod the Great, who assumed the throne of Judea, with Roman support, bringing down the century long Hasmonean Kingdom. His kingdom lasted until his death in 4 BCE, when it was divided between his sons as a Tetrarchy, which lasted for about 10 years. Most of those kingdoms, including Judea proper, were incorporated into Judaea Province in 6 CE, though limited Herodian kingship continued in Northern Levant until 92, when the last Herodian monarch, Agrippa II, died and Rome assumed full power over his domain. - Herod (\\"Hordos\\", Greek: , \\"Hrds\\"; 74/73 BCE 4 BCE), also known as Herod the Great and Herod I, was a Roman client king of Judea, referred to as the Herodian kingdom. The history of his legacy has polarized opinion, as he is known for his colossal building projects throughout Judea, including his expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem (Herod's Temple), the construction of the port at Caesarea Maritima, the fortress at Masada and Herodium. Vital details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century CE RomanJewish historian Josephus. Herod also appears in the Christian Gospel of Matthew as the ruler of Judea who orders the Massacre of the Innocents at the time of the birth of Jesus. Despite his successes, including singlehandedly forging a new aristocracy from practically nothing, he still garnered criticism from various historians.

Movie title: Xanadu Movie plot: Sonny Malone is a talented artist who dreams of fame beyond his job, which is the non-creative task of painting larger versions of album covers for record-store window advertisements. As the film opens, Sonny is broke and on the verge of giving up his dream. Having quit his day job to try to make a living as a freelance artist, but having failed to make any money at it, Sonny returns to his old job at AirFlo Records. After some humorous run-ins with his imperious boss and nemesis, Simpson, he resumes painting record covers. At work, Sonny is told to paint an album cover for a group called The Nine Sisters. The cover features a beautiful woman in front of an art deco auditorium (the Pan-Pacific Auditorium). Earlier that day, this same woman had collided with him, kissed him, then roller-skated away. Now, Malone becomes obsessed with finding her. He finds her at the same auditorium, now abandoned. She identifies herself as Kira, but she will not tell him anything else about herself. Unbeknownst to Sonny, Kira is one of nine mysterious and beautiful women who sprang to life from a local mural in town near the beach. Walking near the beach, Sonny befriends Daniel \\"Danny\\" McGuire, a has-been big band orchestra leader turned construction mogul. Danny lost his muse in the 1940s (who is seen in a flashback scene to bear a startling resemblance to Kira), and Sonny has not yet found his muse. Kira encourages the two men to form a partnership and open a nightclub at the old auditorium from the album cover. She falls in love with Sonny, and this presents a problem because she is actually an Olympian Muse (\\"Kira's\\" real name is Terpsichore, the Muse of Dance). The other eight women from the beginning of the film are her sisters and fellow goddesses, the Muses, and the mural is actually a portal of sorts and their point of entry to Earth. The Muses visit Earth often to help inspire others to pursue their dreams and desires, but in Kira's case, she has violated the rules by which Muses are supposed to conduct themselves, as... Answer:","completion":"Kira is a character in the movie Xanadu, played by Olivia Newton-John. She is one of the nine Muses from Greek mythology, specifically Terpsichore, the Muse of Dance. Throughout the film, Kira serves as a source of inspiration and plays a vital role in helping the main characters, Sonny Malone, a struggling artist, and Daniel \\"Danny\\" McGuire, a has-been big band orchestra leader, achieve their dreams. The plot of Xanadu revolves around Sonny's desire to achieve success in the creative world of art and Danny's redemption as a once-successful orchestra leader. After a series of encounters and revelations about Kira's true identity, Sonny and Danny decide to open a nightclub at an old abandoned auditorium featured on an album cover that Sonny was tasked to paint for a group called The Nine Sisters. This decision opens up a path to personal and professional growth for both characters, supported by Kira's mysterious presence and guidance. Kira's love affair with Sonny, however, goes beyond the boundaries set for Muses, as they are not supposed to engage in romantic relationships with the mortals they inspire. This adds a layer of tension and conflict to the story, as Kira must come to terms with the consequences of her actions and ultimately make decisions that could affect not just her future, but also that of the budding creative partnership between Sonny and Danny. In deciding whether to invest in the film proposal, it would be crucial to consider several factors that could affect the film's potential for success. These include but are not limited to: 1. The target audience: Is the movie intended for a specific demographic or a niche market, like fans of musicals, fantasy, or Greek mythology? Or does it aim to cater to a wider mainstream audience? 2. The cast and crew: Are the actors, directors, and producers involved in the film likely to deliver a compelling final product that captures audiences' attention and satisfies their entertainment needs? 3. The budget: Does the film proposal provide a reasonable and well-thought-out budget, in line with the production needs and potential revenues from the project? 4. The storytelling and visual elements: Does the screenplay have a strong and engaging narrative structure, with well-developed characters, dramatic tension, and emotional depth? Are the visual elements of the film, such as set design and special effects, in line with current industry standards and trends? 5. The current market: What is the demand for movies like Xanadu in today's entertainment industry? Are there similar films that have succeeded or failed in the market recently, and what could be learned from their experiences?

Write an article with the title: \\"Reality bites Obama in Iraq\\"","completion":"Title: Reality Bites Obama in Iraq Introduction: In a world where ambitions and principles collide, reality often serves as the great equalizer. For former US President Barack Obama, this statement rings true as his Middle East policy met unforeseen consequences in Iraq. The genuine desire for peace and stability in the region paradoxically led to chaos and disorder, further solidifying the harshness of realpolitik. This article will delve into Obama's administration's handling of Iraq, highlighting both its achievements and pitfalls. A Promising Start: When Obama ascended to the presidency in 2009, America was entangled in the Iraq War—an endeavor that had cost trillions of dollars and thousands of lives. The new president, voted into office on a platform of change, immediately sought to improve the situation. One of his first foreign policy decisions was the announcement of a timeline for troop withdrawal from Iraq, in line with his campaign promise to end the war. In 2011, when the last American combat troops left Iraq, Obama's supporters declared the mission accomplished, asserting that Iraq was on its path to democracy and peace. However, the optimism would soon turn out to be misguided. The Rise of ISIS: Swiftly following the US troop withdrawal, Iraq plunged into a chaotic state. The fragile political situation, worsened by sectarian rivalries and rampant corruption, created a power vacuum that birthed the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). ISIS was quick to capitalize on the fractures in Iraq's social fabric. The minority Sunni community felt marginalized and oppressed under the predominantly Shiite government, quickly becoming a fertile ground for extremist ideologies. As ISIS began seizing territory, establishing its so-called caliphate, thousands of Iraqis fled their homes in fear. Slow Pace of Intervention: In 2014, ISIS shocked the world by capturing Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, and declaring the establishment of its caliphate in the territories it controlled. The sheer speed and audacity of the group's advance put immense pressure on the Obama administration to act. However, the US response was seen as slow and insufficient by many. Restricted airstrikes and limited support to Iraqi and Kurdish forces were deemed insufficient to defeat the pervasive threat posed by ISIS. Critics argued that Obama's promise to keep American troops out of Iraq had clouded his judgment, preventing the deployment of the necessary force to defeat the terror group. Lessons Learned: The eventual collapse of ISIS' territorial control came as a result of the collective efforts of coalition partners, Iraqi forces, Kurdish militias, and the unwavering determination of the people who lived under the group's tyranny. Looking back at Obama's Middle East policy, several key takeaways emerge. 1. Unintended consequences: Obama's intent to resolve the Iraq issue peacefully was laudable, but the decision to withdraw troops from an unstable state contributed to a power vacuum that ISIS was quick to fill. Policy decisions should consider both the long-term effects and unintended outcomes. 2. Local stability and regional security: In an interconnected world, local instability can have broader implications. The impact of Iraq's descent into chaos rippled through the region, leading to destabilization in neighboring countries such as Syria. 3. Importance of inclusive governance: The neglect of the concerns of Iraq's Sunni population fostered an environment conducive to extremist ideologies. A stable society requires inclusive governance that addresses the needs and aspirations of every community. Conclusion: The path to peace is rarely straightforward. As the Obama administration discovered, untangling the intricate web of policies and legacies left by the prior administration would prove to be a Herculean task. That said, though the experience was fraught with difficulties, it provides critical insights into the complexities of international relations and the importance of long-term strategic planning—a lesson that all leaders would do well to remember."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Ibn Khaldun can be regarded as the earliest scientific systematic sociologist. The modern sociology, emerged in the early 19th century as the academic response to the modernization of the world. Among many early sociologists (e.g., Émile Durkheim), the aim of sociology was in structuralism, understanding the cohesion of social groups, and developing an \\"antidote\\" to social disintegration. Max Weber was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of rationalization, which he believed would trap individuals in an \\"iron cage\\" of rational thought. Some sociologists, including Georg Simmel and W. E. B. Du Bois, utilized more microsociological, qualitative analyses. This microlevel approach played an important role in American sociology, with the theories of George Herbert Mead and his student Herbert Blumer resulting in the creation of the symbolic interactionism approach to sociology.

Two key senators on Thursday announced that the bipartisan proposal they've crafted to fix Obamacare's cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments has a total of 24 original co-sponsors on both sides of the aisle. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee, reached an agreement with his ranking member, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, and it's backed by 12 Democrats and 12 Republicans. The short-term deal would extend CSR payments for the next two years and would eliminate the question about whether paying them is legal. The agreement would permanently amend Obamacare to give new flexibility for states to create insurance policies that have a larger variety and lower costs and it also would continue CSRs during 2018 and 2019. \\"This is a first step,\\" Alexander said on the Senate floor. \\"Improve it, and pass it sooner rather than later.\\" Here are the co-sponsors: Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska Sen. Richard Burr, R-North Carolina Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia Sen.

Al Franken, D-Minnesota Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-New Hampshire Alexander noted that the subsidies pay for co-pays and deductibles for low-income Americans and he noted that every Republican in the House who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare earlier this year voted for a provision in their measure that would continue CSR payments for the next two years. The GOP senator said that he and Murray are open to improving the language of their agreement and they both emphasized that they wrote it so that it requires states to make sure that the benefits of the payments go to the consumer and not insurance companies. Alexander said that the short-term deal resulted from negotiations with Murray, with whom he had already been working, when President Trump called him on Columbus Day weekend to inform him that he would cut off the CSR payments and to request that Congress put together a short-term deal to continue them. Publicly, Mr. Trump has repeatedly slammed the subsidies, claiming they enrich insurers.

Available choices: *no. *yes.","completion":"*no. While these two sentences might seem identical at first glance, they contain significant differences that disqualify them from being considered as paraphrases of one another. First and foremost, paraphrasing involves presenting the same information or message in a different wording or structure while maintaining the original intent and essential information. For paraphrasing to be accurate, it should not alter the meaning, facts, or details of the original statement. The first sentence \\"Itami-go was a part of Arioka Castle, which was ruled by Araki Murashige under Oda Nobunaga.\\" indicates that Araki Murashige was the ruler of Arioka Castle (which includes Itami-go) under the overarching rule or authority of Oda Nobunaga. On the other hand, the second sentence \\"Itami-go was a part of the castle of Arioka, which ruled Oda Nobunaga under Araki Murashige.\\" suggests that the castle of Arioka (and therefore, Itami-go) had authority or rule over Oda Nobunaga, under the direction or power of Araki Murashige. Given these described situations are different, these sentences cannot be considered as paraphrases. The change of positions between Araki Murashige and Oda Nobunaga in the structures of these two sentences drastically alters the suggested power dynamics and relationships between the characters and places discussed.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: By Vincent DowdArts correspondent, BBC News He was a hugely celebrated painter but before they met in 1935 she was already known in France for her photographic work. The Tate Modern exhibition sheds light on Maar's life and on her sometimes neglected work. In 1935 Maar (born Henriette Théodora Markovitch) was unit stills photographer on a film being shot at the Billancourt Studios on the outskirts of Paris. She was introduced to Picasso, 26 years her senior and already a world-famous artist. Maar became his lover and - some have thought - the most influential of his muses. For the next eight years they were part of one another's lives - although Picasso continued his existing relationship with Marie-Thérèse Walter. Those few basic facts are often all that even art-lovers know about Maar, who died in 1997. Over the years there were many women in Picasso's life and she was undoubtedly one of those who mattered most to him. But Maar's reputation has been growing. A version of the Tate Modern show has already been seen at the Pompidou Centre in Paris and next year the exhibition will travel to Los Angeles. As a photographer and a painter in her own right does she deserve now to step out of his shadow? Or could what she achieved now be overstated, to compensate for decades of neglect? Professor Mary Ann Caws wrote a book about Maar 20 years ago, before her reputation had revived, and considers Maar to have been a \\"remarkable talent\\". \\"Much of her early work in France was fashion photography but it's unlike anyone else's fashion photography.... the best of her pictures are very dramatic. \\"The juxtapositions are often peculiar and so is the way she used light and dark. As soon as you know even a sample of what Dora Maar did you will always recognise her work - the pictures will speak to you. The proportions of her photographs can be peculiar but the work's always telling and has an impact. \\"Some of her photos can be shadowy and have a feeling of doom yet others can be remarkably funny. But the fashion images were only one part of Dora Maar. She went to Barcelona and took pictures of starving people in desperate circumstances. A lot of that work has been ignored because people see her in the context of knowing Picasso later.\\" Emma Lewis is co-curator of the Tate Modern show, which contains more than 250 photographic images. She says she's come to admire the \\"dark glamour\\" of Maar's work but adds \\"there's a playful element too - real subversive wit\\". Maar also photographed some of the 30,000 inhabitants of \\"la zone\\" - the circular strip of undeveloped land which became a wretched linear shantytown around Paris. The Tate Modern exhibition has striking examples of all these elements of her early career. Lewis says the 1930s were the heyday of illustrated weekly and monthly magazines. \\"It provided Dora with a means of making a living and we show how talented she was in what she did. \\"It allowed her to play with avant garde and experimental imagery. She was involved with Surrealism - but I think it was very hard for a woman to be part of that group of artists. \\"Dora Maar's commercial work appeared in big French magazines of the day such as Rester Jeune. It also circulated in various arts journals and erotic reviews. \\"By and large the documentary photography was seen in exhibitions and not in print. But her politics were left-wing and in the Depression her documentary work on the plight of the poor was important to her - she had links to the radical Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists.\\" The exhibition could hardly ignore the Picasso connection. But it puts that part of Maar's life in context. As a photographer she recorded him working on probably his best known painting - Guernica (1937). Visitors to the Tate can see some of the Picasso works influenced by Maar in their years together, including the well-known Weeping Woman (also of 1937) which the Tate already owns. Some describe this as a portrait of Maar but she always insisted she had never modelled for Picasso for any picture. But she acknowledged he used elements of her appearance. Professor Caws says Maar was the most intellectual of Picasso muses. \\"She spoke Spanish which meant they could have real conversations about the convulsive events of the 1930s. She was beautiful but I think Picasso was attracted by the dramatic spark she had.\\" The passionate relationship faded from around 1942 and Maar headed south to live in Menérbes in Provence. So had Maar accepted that no woman would ever possess Picasso? \\"I don't think she was a woman meekly to accept anything,\\" says Professor Caws. \\"When it all ended she was screaming and passionate and furious. But when she settled in the south she developed her own skills as a painter, something which used to be ignored when people wrote about her. Those paintings can be pretty remarkable but the best of the photography is incredible. \\"So we don't need to try to cut Pablo Picasso out of her life. She still has things to say to us with him or without him.\\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously.

It is very easy to chip a nail without necessarily breaking a finger. The Choices: A). Finger is very strong. B). Nail is very strong.","completion":"It is very easy to chip a nail without necessarily breaking a finger. The reason for this can be attributed to two main factors: A). The finger is very strong. 1. Bone structure: The phalanges, or finger bones, are specially designed to withstand a lot of pressure and force due to their structure. The bones are interconnected by joints that provide support and stability, making it harder for fingers to break under normal circumstances. 2. Muscles and tendons: The fingers are also equipped with muscles and tendons that surround the bones, providing additional strength and support. These work together to enable our fingers to carry out a wide range of motions and tasks, while also aiding in the absorption of impact, lessening the likelihood of a break. However, in contrast to the strength of the finger, a nail is much more susceptible to damage. B). The nail is less strong. 1. Nail structure: Nails are made up of a protein called keratin, which is also found in hair and skin. This protein makes the nail more prone to chipping and breaking, as it is more malleable and less dense when compared to bone. 2. Exposure: Nails are exposed to external elements far more than the finger bones, increasing their vulnerability to damage. Activities like typing, scratching, or accidentally knocking the nail against a hard surface may cause it to chip or crack, even if the finger remains unharmed. In conclusion, it is important to note that while fingers are quite strong and resistant to damage due to their complex bone structure, muscles, and tendons, nails are less strong and more prone to chipping as they are made of a less dense protein and are constantly in contact with external forces. So, it is common to chip a nail without breaking a finger. To maintain nail health, it is advisable to take care of your nails through regular trimming, filing, and moisturizing, as well as avoiding harsh chemicals and activities that may weaken them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

Send a message regarding the item. Constantly bring it up.","completion":"Title: The Art of Reclaiming Your Borrowed Possessions Introduction Lending personal belongings such as books, clothes, or electronic gadgets to friends and family is a common practice. It's a sign of trust and goodwill, and can even strengthen bonds. However, it's not unusual for these borrowed items to take an extended vacation and be forgotten in the borrower's home. No one wants to come across as rude or petty, so reclaiming your possessions can sometimes be a daunting task. In this article, we will discuss a few effective ways to be forward about asking for your belongings back without damaging relationships. 1. Be Forward about Asking for Your Belongings The first and most critical step in recovering your loaned items is to be direct and honest. Express your need for the specific item and explain its importance to you. For instance, if a friend borrowed your favorite book, you can say, \\"Hey, since I want to read that book again, could I please have it back by next week?\\" Being upfront may feel uncomfortable initially, but it shows maturity and integrity and helps to avoid misunderstandings. 2. Ask a Question about the Item When asking for your possessions back, doing so in the form of a question can be a more subtle approach. If you've lent your favorite jacket to a friend, instead of bluntly saying you want it returned, ask how they like using it or if they've had a chance to wear it. For example, \\"Hey, how did that jacket work out for you on your hiking trip?\\" Such a question prompts the borrower to think about the item and remember that it belongs to you. It is a gentle reminder that you might need it back sooner than later. 3. Send a Message Regarding the Item Sometimes, talking face-to-face can be awkward or not feasible. In those cases, sending a text message or email can be a diplomatic alternative for asking for your belongings back. A carefully composed message can convey your feelings without sounding confrontational. For example, \\"Hey, I hope you're enjoying the camera I lent you last month. But I was wondering if you were finished with it since I have a family event coming up that I'd like to use it for?\\" This not only reminds the borrower but also indicates that you have a genuine need for it, encouraging them to return it promptly. 4. Constantly Bring It Up If your previous attempts at reclaiming your borrowed possessions have been unsuccessful, you may need to be more persistent. You can bring up the topic casually during conversations or when spending time with the borrower in person. However, be careful not to seem overly aggressive or pushy. An example of this method could be mentioning an upcoming event where you will need the borrowed item, or even suggesting a get-together to exchange items you've both borrowed from one another. 5. Seek Assistance from Mutual Friends If it's getting increasingly difficult to receive your borrowed belongings, enlisting help from mutual friends could be beneficial. These friends can remind your friend on your behalf or even offer to pick up the item for you in a casual manner. It's essential to choose a close and reliable friend for this role, as you want to avoid any further complications or misunderstandings. Conclusion In conclusion, asking for your loaned items back can be a delicate situation. However, by following the above tips, you can confidently establish open communication and regain your belongings without causing a rift in your relationships. Remember to be sincere and considerate while being proactive, and always ensure the borrower understands how much you value your possessions. Maintaining healthy boundaries and honest conversations about your belongings will ultimately lead to stronger and more trustworthy connections with your friends and family."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In a defensive struggle most of the game, Steve McNair was intercepted three times and Jamal Lewis was held to 43 yards rushing. The Ravens got on the board first when Matt Stover kicked a 24-yard field goal, following a fumble by Broncos RB Tatum Bell. The Broncos responded with a 43-yard field goal of their own by Jason Elam. The Ravens drove deep into Broncos territory late at the end of the first half, but that drive was thwarted as Steve McNair was intercepted by Champ Bailey in the end zone on a pass intended for Clarence Moore. The third quarter saw no points scored by either team as the defensive struggle continued. The Broncos controlled the clock in the second half with the running game led by Tatum Bell, who atoned for his fumble in the first quarter, by bouncing back with 92 yards rushing. Ravens QB McNair was intercepted again by Darrent Williams, which led to a Jake Plummer to Rod Smith touchdown pass. McNair was intercepted a third time, ending the Ravens' final drive, this time by Domonique Foxworth. With their first loss, the Ravens dropped to 4-1.

Short movie review: a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the given short movie review, it appears that the critic has a somewhat positive opinion of the movie. The phrases \\"a pleasant distraction\\" and \\"a Friday night diversion\\" suggest that the movie might not be a cinematic masterpiece or a thought-provoking film, but rather an enjoyable way to spend time and have some entertainment. The use of the word \\"pleasant\\" implies that the movie has a feel-good element, is easy to watch, and generally provides a good experience for the viewer. In the context of a Friday night, when people typically look forward to winding down and having some amusement after a long week, the term \\"diversion\\" indicates that the movie serves to offer a temporary escape from daily stresses or concerns. However, it is important to note that this review does not necessarily imply that the movie is outstanding or exceptional. The critic may view the film as average or satisfactory at best, serving its purpose as a light form of amusement. Consequently, the review suggests that the movie falls into the category of an acceptable and passable form of entertainment, rather than being considered a must-watch or highly acclaimed production. In summary, the critic has a slightly positive opinion of the movie due to its enjoyable, entertaining, and relaxing nature. It provides a pleasant way to unwind on a Friday night, despite not being exceptional or groundbreaking in any significant way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A more appropriate answer should address the date of invention. The tide-predicting machine was invented by Sir William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) in 1872. This groundbreaking device was designed to help anticipate tidal patterns, which was essential for navigation purposes. By utilizing a system of gears, pulleys, and wires, the machine was able to make predictions about tide levels at specific locations and time intervals with high accuracy. Sir William Thomson was a Scottish physicist and mathematician who made significant contributions to various scientific fields, including thermodynamics, electricity, and magnetism. His invention of the tide-predicting machine was just one of his many accomplishments, which also include the development of the absolute temperature scale, now known as the Kelvin scale. In the late 19th century, the tide-predicting machine played a critical role in maritime navigation, shipping, and the construction of coastal infrastructure. By providing advance knowledge of tide levels, it enabled ships to avoid hazards like shallow waters and contributed to more efficient maritime operations. Over the years, the design and mechanism of the tide-predicting machine were improved upon by various engineers and inventors.

The film is based on a real-life story and directed by Steven Soderbergh. In the movie, Roberts portrayed Erin Brockovich, a determined and feisty legal assistant who brought attention and justice to the victims of a massive environmental contamination case in Hinkley, California. Erin Brockovich's work led to the revelation that the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) had been contaminating the town's water with hexavalent chromium, which is a harmful and carcinogenic chemical. As a result, the company faced a lawsuit and ultimately settled by paying out a significant sum of 333 million to the affected residents of Hinkley, making it one of the largest settlements in a direct-action lawsuit in the history of the United States. Julia Roberts' portrayal of the fearless and tenacious Erin Brockovich garnered widespread critical acclaim for her unwavering dedication to the role and her ability to embody the real-life character's spirit. Not only did Roberts' performance earn her the coveted Oscar, but she also received a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama for her role.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Some trees can survive a long time without water. Think of trees that grow in the desert. But other trees may need more moisture than they can get from rainfall or from the air . Trees and other plants can look thirsty. Leaves can become weak and hang downward. They can also turn yellow. Yellowing can be a sign of too much water. But it can also be a warning sign of too little water. With a newly planted tree, the roots have not yet spread out from the root ball. The root ball can become dry faster than the dirt around it. So put water on the area of the root ball and the surrounding soil until the roots become established. Once a tree is well established, water deeply instead of watering often. The amount of water needed depends on the tree and the soil. Clay soils hold water for longer periods while sandy soil holds less water. During the hottest season, a deep watering may satisfy a tree for anywhere from ten days to four weeks. Ted Swiecki is a plant scientist . He says people should not water established trees at the base of the trunk . This can harm the tree. Too much water in the soil at the base of a tree can lead to the growth of fungi . If the area is too wet, harmful organisms have a better chance to invade the tree and cause disease. Mr. Swiecki says this is true especially in Mediterranean and semi-dry climates. Many trees in these climates have adapted to having a dry area near their base during the hottest season. He said, \\"Water displaces (,)air in the soil. And roots are aerobic ; they require oxygen for the soil to function properly. So if you keep the soil completely wet and there's no air there, then the roots are starving for oxygen.\\" Question: Which of the following situations requires the most watering?

York-born William Etty (1787–1849) had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses (\\"Odysseus\\" in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, \\"My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS\\". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, \\"Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around / Lie human bones that whiten all the ground. / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore.\\" A:","completion":"The last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens is Etty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fourteen hours later, four perfectly dressed Japanese gentlemen greeted her at Narita Airport. Smiling and bowing low, they handed her their business cards. With her bag in one hand, Geri took their cards with the other. She thanked them, glanced briefly at the cards, and put them into her jeans pocket quickly. When the five of them arrived at the hotel, they invited Geri to tea in the lobby . While sipping tea, the gentlemen presented her with a small gift which she eagerly opened. She was thrilled with the gift and shouted excitedly, \\"Oh, it's beautiful!\\" At this point, the four Japanese gentlemen stood up and, bowing only very slightly, said \\"Sayonara\\" and left immediately.

Today we are going to talk about a big adventure: finding a house that you can afford. Just like when you save your pocket money to buy a toy, grown-ups have to save money to buy a house. Let's learn how they do it! 1. Knowing How Much to Spend First, grown-ups need to find out how much money they can spend on a house. They do this by looking at how much money they make and what other things they need to pay for, like food, clothes, and fun activities. This helps them know how much they can save for a house. 2. Make a Savings Plan Next, they make a plan to save money. Just like you put coins in your piggy bank, grown-ups put money in a special place called a savings account. They decide how much to save each month, and they keep track of it. With a good plan, they can save enough money to buy the house they want. 3. Find a House in Your Budget Now comes the fun part! Grown-ups look for a house that is just right for their budget. This means they can pay for it without running out of money. They visit different houses and pick the one that meets their needs and is not too expensive. 4. Don't Forget Extra Costs When you buy a toy, there might be extras like batteries not included. It's the same for houses! Grown-ups also have to think about extra costs like taxes, insurance, and fixing things that might be broken. They need to make sure they can pay for these costs too. 5. Get Help from Friends Finding a house you can afford can be difficult. Grown-ups get help from friends called \\"real estate agents\\" who know a lot about houses and can help them find the right one. These friends make sure the grown-ups find a house that is safe, cozy, and fits in their budget. So little ones, that's how grown-ups find a house they can afford. Just like you, they need to be patient, save their money, and make smart choices.

However a large portion of those walls remain.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The walls referred to in the context are the medieval walls surrounding the city. There are still walls remaining for several reasons: 1. Historical significance: The medieval walls are part of the city's rich history, and preserving them serves as a way to remember and honor the city's past. These walls are an integral part of the architectural landscape and contribute to the city's identity. 2. Incomplete demolition: The partial demolition of the walls in 1932 and 1938 may have left some sections intact due to various factors, such as resource constraints, changing priorities, or opposition from citizens who valued the walls' historical and cultural significance. 3. Protection and preservation efforts: Over time, people began to fully appreciate the historical and cultural importance of the remaining walls. This led to increased efforts to protect and preserve them. Government bodies, heritage organizations, and local communities have worked together to ensure the surviving walls are restored and maintained for future generations. 4. Architectural resilience: The walls may have survived due in part to their construction, which was designed to withstand attacks and resist natural disasters. The resilience of these structures allowed them to endure over centuries, even as the world around them changed dramatically. In conclusion, the remaining walls can be attributed to various factors, such as historical significance, incomplete demolition, protection and preservation efforts, and the walls' architectural resilience. These walls now serve as a reminder of the city's past while providing a unique backdrop for modern urban development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Then, last Friday, the son's car was discovered in Nantes, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) from where the daughter's possessions were found. Though Sennes told French media following the discovery that the case was progressing rapidly, he said, \\"it is still very premature to imagine any scenario with certainty.\\" However, authorities also said they suspect the son, Sebastien, of murdering his family. The last time anyone saw or heard from the family was on February 16, the same day the mother and daughter notified police that someone had used Charlotte's bank card to pay for online video games. Neighbors said Sebastien suffered from mental illness, and he once got in trouble with the law for making death threats online.

News article: As college students across the country stream onto campuses this week, Duke University’s The Chronicle reports that “some” members of the Class of 2019 were refusing to read a book assigned to them this summer as part of the elite school’s Common Experience Summer Reading program. Many colleges have similar programs. In preparation for my first year of college in 1989, I myself read Jonathan Kozol’s Rachel and Her Children: Homeless Families in America and Nadine Gordimer’s Something Out There. I can still remember my new classmates’ passionate arguments about South Africa’s apartheid regime and chronic homelessness in New York. This summer the first-years at the college where I now teach are reading Piper Kerman’s Orange is the New Black. At least they better be. We can disagree with the authors of the books we read, but we have to read them first. It’s unclear how many of Duke’s 1,750 incoming students skipped Alison Bechdel’s highly-acclaimed 2006 graphic-novel style memoir Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic. That anyone admitted to a top university would purposely ignore their first assignment is, first and foremost, sad. These students have denied themselves a great read. The book, beautifully written and illustrated, won numerous literary awards and inspired a Broadway musical that swept the Tonys this spring. It’s a bittersweet story detailing Bechdel’s life growing up with a closeted gay father “who killed himself a few months after I came out to my parents as a lesbian.” Heavy stuff, for sure, but higher education is about examining the heavy stuff. Through her unique lens, Bechdel explores the themes of family, growing up and self-acceptance; themes we all can relate to. What’s really disappointing, however, are the reasons students have given for refusing to read the book. According to The Chronicle, they think it’s pornographic. When I heard that, I grabbed my copy off the shelf to find the porn I apparently missed the first time around. I’m not sure how one labels a book pornographic without actually reading it, of course. Maybe it’s a new twist on the Stewart test: I know it when I don’t see it? Either way, it represents the antithesis of education, which requires both the opening of books and the opening of minds. It’s true that a few panels of grey-scale drawings in the 232-page book do depict partial adult nudity and consensual sexuality. Certainly no one is exploited or objectified, making these examples far less offensive than your average love scene—both in popular culture and in classic literature. Which leads me to the conclusion that it’s not really the illustrations that have caused this most recent controversy, but rather the queer-identitifed people depicted in them. Do these students think that four panels depicting partial nudity or sex between women will make them gay or skew their sense of self? Do these students think that four panels depicting partial nudity or sex between women will make them gay? Do they think that exposure to such drawings will skew their sense of self? Or deep down do they fear that their homophobia will become hard to justify once they’ve been confronted with it in such an honest and empathetic setting. College students are adults and should be able read about sex and sexuality. They should be able to read about the lives of all kinds of people, because the reality is people identify across a wide spectrum of sexual identities. All of our stories matter. Education—especially higher education—obliges us to read, hear, and see things that we might not otherwise encounter. Anyone committed to learning must therefore engage with people, perspectives, ideas, and experiences that may at first seem strange, confusing, or problematic. Learning means we attempt to understand—it doesn’t mean we have to like everything we’re exposed to. We can disagree with the authors of the books we read, but we have to read them first. Worthwhile ideas and values can withstand exposure to other ideas and values. But those seeking a university education should be prepared to have the worldview and perspectives they developed at 18 challenged and expanded. If not, why go to college? Or read? Or think? If we aren’t being challenged, we aren’t learning. If we don’t do the work, we fail. The Duke students who refused to read Fun Home have already failed. Willfully. Perhaps Duke should dismiss them, as they’re unwilling to take on college-level study. Let them reapply when they are ready to face the danger presented by a comic book. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com. ||||| Duke Chapel on the campus of Duke University in Durham, N.C. (Jim R. Bounds/Bloomberg) As a Christian, I knew that my beliefs and identity would be challenged at a progressive university like Duke. My first challenge came well before I arrived on campus, when I learned that all first years were assigned “Fun Home,” a graphic novel by Alison Bechdel. The book includes cartoon drawings of a woman masturbating and multiple women engaging in oral sex. After researching the book’s content and reading a portion of it, I chose to opt out of the assignment. My choice had nothing to do with the ideas presented. I’m not opposed to reading memoirs written by LGBTQ individuals or stories containing suicide. I’m not even opposed to reading Freud, Marx or Darwin. I know that I’ll have to grapple with ideas I don’t agree with, even ideas that I find immoral. But in the Bible, Jesus forbids his followers from exposing themselves to anything pornographic. “But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart,” he says in Matthew 5:28-29. “If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away.” This theme is reiterated by Paul who warns, “flee from sexual immorality.” I think there is an important distinction between images and written words. If the book explored the same themes without sexual images or erotic language, I would have read it. But viewing pictures of sexual acts, regardless of the genders of the people involved, conflict with the inherent sacredness of sex. My beliefs extend to pop culture and even Renaissance art depicting sex. I’m well aware that my ethics make me an anomaly on campus, in contemporary culture and even among many professing Christians. However, my principles come primarily from my understanding of the Bible, which I have read multiple times, studied weekly in community for the last seven years, and consider to be the Word of God. I don’t believe my position will limit my exposure to essential lessons in history, philosophy or literature. I assume that having to view graphic images of sex for a class will be rare. If it does happen, I will avoid any titillating content and encourage like-minded students to do the same. And I believe professors should warn me about such material, not because I might consider them offensive or discomforting, but because I consider it immoral. Still, if my academic experience at Duke is full of thought-provoking stimuli other than pictures of sexual acts, it’s hard for me to believe that it will be incomplete. I decided to post about my decision on the Duke Class of 2019 Facebook page to comfort those with similar beliefs. I knew that my decision wouldn’t be well-received. How could it in a country where, according to one study, more than three-quarters of American men between 18 and 24 years old have viewed pornography within the past month. But though many students denounced my decision publicly, almost 20 people privately messaged me, thanking me for my post. I received many messages from Christians, but a message from a Muslim man stood out. The man, currently a sophomore at Duke, wrote, “I’ve seen a lot of people who just throw away their identity in college in the name of secularism, open-mindedness, or liberalism.” Is this really what Duke wants? Cultural pluralism will lose its value if students aren’t allowed to follow their beliefs, even if they are conservative. Without genuine diversity, intellectual dialogue and growth are stifled. I recognize, of course, that Christians on campus and throughout the country have an important responsibility, too. We need to learn how to dialogue across differences. Over the past couple of days, I have received many encouraging messages from a new friend, who considers herself bisexual and a Buddhist. She and I became friends after she saw my Facebook post. Instead of criticizing me, she asked me to explain my beliefs. I, in turn, asked her to explain the Buddhist perspective on sexuality. This is how diversity is supposed to work. We each shared our perspective, and walked away from the conversation with a deeper understanding and compassion for each other. That is what college is really about. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Many college students are assigned books to read as part of a summer reading program, and it is not uncommon for incoming students to have opinions and disagreements about the content. At Duke University, some members of the Class of 2019 refused to read Alison Bechdel's graphic-novel memoir \\"Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic\\" for their Common Experience Summer Reading program. While it is unclear how many students did not read the book, the reasons given for their refusal included the belief that the book is pornographic. These claims are based on a few panels depicting partial adult nudity and consensual sexuality in the book. However, the real issue for these students may not be the illustrations themselves, but the fact that they depict queer-identified people. College should be a place where students engage with new ideas and perspectives, even if they may not agree with them. By refusing to read the book, these students have chosen not to engage in college-level study and learn from different experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \\"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \\"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \\"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\\" Question: \\"Legal assistance is now a little easier for battered women to find in what county?\\" Answer: \\"Porter county\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, the answer is not correct.

Make a loop about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the free end of the yarn. The free end should hang behind your loop. Insert your crochet hook through the loop and hook the free end before pulling it back through the loop and onto the hook. Remember not to count your first stitch towards the 60 chains. To make one chain stitch, you'll want to hold the hook in you right hand and loop the working yarn over your left index finger. Hold the end of the slipknot between the thumb and middle finger of your left hand. Then, bring the yarn from back to front around the shaft of the hook, drawing it through the loop on the hook. Repeat this to make the first row, or foundation chain. Add 3 chains onto the 60 that you already have. This will maintain the height when you start crocheting the following rows. This will effectively count as turning your work, so just continue crocheting the row. To double chain, insert your hook into the fourth chain. Yarn over and pull the yarn through the chain. At this point, you should have three loops on your hook. Yarn over again and pull through two loops on your hook. You should now have one loop on your hook. Make sure to insert your hook into the chain and not the gap closer to your hook. To double crochet into your chain, insert your hook and yarn over. Pull up a loop, yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two. Continue doing this across the length of the chain. Check to make sure you have 60 stitches once you complete the row. Turning your work simply means rotating it so that the last stitch you worked becomes the beginning of the next row. skip one stitch and double crochet 6 times into the next stitch. Repeat this all the way across. To double crochet, yarn over insert your hook under both of your loops, yarn over, and pull up. You should now have three loops on your hook. Yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two. skip one stitch and single crochet into the next stitch. Repeat this all the way across. To single crochet, insert your hook from front to back in the center of the second chain from the hook. At this point, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over, or twist the yarn from front to back around the hook, and pull the yarn through the chain. Again, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over again and draw through the 2 loops. You'll now have single crochet stitches. Cut the working yarn, then wrap the tail around your hook and pull it completely through your loop. Wrap and roll your scalloped piece so the scalloped edges face out like petals. Make sure to keep the straight edges lined up as you roll since you'll need to secure them later. Wrapping the scalloped piece tightly will create a smaller ruffled rose, as compared to one that's looser and larger. Play with wrapping until you create a shape you like. Thread a darning or embroidery needle using the tail from your scalloped piece. Insert your needle into the next row over. Pull through to tighten the end of your scalloped piece. Using your threaded needle, continue working back and forth through the bottom or base of the row. Make sure to pass through all of the rose's layers. Keep working the thread back and forth until the rose feels secure. Trim the remaining thread and use your rose. Summary:","completion":"1.

A startup is usually a company designed to effectively develop and validate a scalable business model. Can we draw the following conclusion? A start-up validates a scalable business model.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that a start-up validates a scalable business model. However, it is essential to further analyze various aspects of a start-up to fully comprehend this statement. Start-ups are typically created to bring innovation and transformation to different industries and markets. Innovations can be in the form of new products, services, processes, or platforms. To determine the sustainability and success of these innovative ideas and concepts, start-ups must validate their business models. A scalable business model is one that has the potential to deliver increased revenue and growth as the company invests time, resources, and money. It allows the start-up to cater to an ever-growing customer base without compromising on its performance or quality. For a start-up to be considered successful and have the potential to become a strong market competitor, the business model must be scalable. In the process of validating the scalability of their business model, start-ups often go through the following steps: 1. Market research: Start-ups conduct extensive market research to understand the existing market situation, customer needs, and opportunities for growth. Market research helps start-ups discover the potential and desirability for their innovative product, service, process, or platform. 2. Idea validation: The start-up must test its innovative concepts and product feasibility to ensure that the idea resonates with potential customers and satisfies their needs effectively. 3. Business plan development: A comprehensive business plan is developed, which outlines the start-up's mission, objectives, target market, strategies, and financial projections. The business plan helps streamline the company's efforts and serves as a blueprint for its growth and development. 4. Financial model validation: Start-ups need to create a scalable financial model that demonstrates the potential growth of the company. This includes assessing investment needs, revenue streams, and potential profit margins. 5. Prototype, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and testing: To validate the business model, start-ups often develop a prototype or MVP. This is a basic version of the product or service that can be tested and iterated with real users to receive feedback, refine the offering, and improve its value proposition. 6. Iteration and improvement: Start-ups continuously iterate their products, services, or platform to incorporate user feedback and improve its attractiveness to consumers. 7. Scaling the business: Once the business model has been validated and the start-up demonstrates its scalability, the company will focus on marketing and sales strategies to increase its market share and generate larger revenues. In conclusion, validating a scalable business model is crucial to the success of a start-up. This process helps start-ups identify and optimize the factors that will ultimately lead to their sustainable growth and increased profits.

Booststhemetabolism(throughnumerouscertainprocedures) Please segment the words.","completion":"Boosts the metabolism (through numerous certain procedures) Metabolism is a crucial process that occurs within the body to maintain life. It involves various chemical reactions that break down substances to produce energy and build up other essential molecules. Several procedures can influence metabolism rates, which can help improve overall health, promote weight loss, and increase energy levels. Here is a detailed explanation of several approaches to boost metabolism: 1. Regular Exercise: Physical activity stimulates the metabolism by increasing the body's demand for energy. Engaging in both aerobic and resistance exercises, such as walking, jogging, swimming, and weight lifting, can enhance metabolic rates even when at rest. 2. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): This form of exercise involves alternating between short periods of intense physical activity and periods of recovery. HIIT has been shown to boost metabolism significantly and lead to greater calorie burning. 3. Eating Protein-rich Foods: Consuming foods high in protein can help boost metabolism since the body uses more energy to digest proteins compared to carbohydrates or fats. Incorporating lean meats, fish, eggs, nuts, and legumes into your diet can stimulate the metabolic process. 4. Drinking Green Tea: Green tea contains epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant that can increase metabolism by promoting a process called thermogenesis – the production of heat in the body. 5. Consuming Caffeine: Caffeine, found in coffee and some teas, can stimulate the central nervous system and boost metabolism in the short term. However, excessive consumption may lead to adverse effects on health. 6. Drinking Cold Water: Drinking cold water has been shown to increase metabolism temporarily since the body needs to expend energy to warm the water to body temperature. 7. Adequate Sleep: Insufficient sleep can negatively affect metabolism, making it essential to get a good night's rest to maintain a healthy metabolic rate. 8. Eating Smaller, Frequent Meals: Consuming smaller meals throughout the day can help regulate blood sugar levels and prevent overeating, both of which can contribute to a stable metabolism. 9. Spices in the Diet: Some spices, such as cayenne pepper, contain compounds that can stimulate metabolism by increasing thermogenesis. 10. Building Muscle Mass: Because muscle tissue requires more energy to maintain than fat, increasing muscle mass through strength training can lead to a higher metabolic rate. 11. Managing Stress: Stress can lead to the release of hormones like cortisol, which can negatively impact metabolism. Using stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and spending time in nature can help reduce stress and maintain a healthy metabolism. In conclusion, boosting metabolism can be achieved through various procedures involving exercise, diet adjustments, maintaining proper hydration, ensuring adequate sleep, stress management, and building muscle mass. Implementing a combination of these strategies can help improve overall health, weight management, and energy levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there. He could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near. Patch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : TLDR at the bottom So on the spring of 2016 I found out that my college girlfriend got pregnant. She wanted to have an abortion but as a christian I felt that this was against my beliefs (btw I’m not pro-life, I feel like the option to abort should be there for people that don’t believe what I do but this is what I thought was right for my child). I was graduating that year and already had a pretty well-paying job lined up so I felt that I could provide for my kid. In the end me and my girlfriend came to the agreement that the baby be born but that I would be a single parent since she did not want to have a baby this young. That fall the baby was born and after that she moved back to her home state (she went out of state for college) and I got my son. At the time me and my girlfriend were 21. Fast forward two years and I just feel so tired and secluded from the world. My only friend is my son, between work and him I have no free time. All I do on my free time is go to the park with him, watch kids shows etc. My mom live kinda far away but she visits every few months and lets me have some alone time but it’s not enough. Also I basically have the same job I had when I graduated college with a slight salary increase, I have not been able to take any initiatives at work to qualify me for a promotion due to my parent responsibilities and a lot of people that started after me outrank me now. And I can’t date, like who wants a 23 year old guy with a kid. I just feel unfulfilled and alone and it has started to take it’s form in a little bit of animosity against my son and I never want that to happen. I want to be a great dad that loves his kid but I don’t think I can be that, I’ve tried for two years. You always hear about this undying love you’ll have for your kid but I just never had that. So WIBTA for putting my son up for adoption? I would have to make sure he actually get’s adopted into a stable family like I grew up in and not into a foster home (don’t know how I would go about that though). The thing that makes me think that I am an asshole is that he has started to form an attachment to me and that it would be unfair on him to leave him and unfair on his grandmother that also has a good connection with him. But what makes me think I’m not an asshole is that I think that his childhood would just get worse the more lonely and unfulfilled I feel and that he’s better off with a more stable family. Please give me your perspective. TLDR: I am a single dad that feels like he’s personal life is interfering with his ability to be a father, WIBTA to put up my two year old for adoption?

CHAPTER VIII AN INFORMAL COURT One morning, soon after Fuller and his daughter had gone home, Dick stood at a table in the testing house behind the mixing sheds. The small, galvanized iron building shook with the throb of engines and rattle of machinery, and now and then a shower of cinders pattered upon the roof; for the big mill that ground up the concrete was working across the road. The lattice shutters were closed, for the sake of privacy, and kept out the glare, though they could not keep out the heat, which soaked through the thin, iron walls, and Dick's face was wet with perspiration as he arranged a number of small concrete blocks. Some of these were broken, and some partly crushed. Delicate scales and glass measures occupied a neighboring shelf, and a big steel apparatus that looked rather like a lever weighing machine stood in the shadow. Where the draught that came through the lattices flowed across the room, Bethune lounged in a canvas chair, and another man, with a quiet, sunburned face, sat behind him. This was Stuyvesant, whose authority was only second to Fuller's. \\"Brandon seems to have taken a good deal of trouble, but this kind of investigation needs the strictest accuracy, and we haven't the best of testing apparatus,\\" Bethune remarked. \\"I expect he'll allow that the results he has got may be to some extent misleading, and I doubt if it's worth while to go on with the matter.

The film begins 4 years after the events of the first one, with George Banks telling the audience he is ready for the empty nest he'll shortly receive with all of his children grown up. Shortly thereafter, Annie tells the family that she's pregnant, and George begins to mildly panic, insisting he is too young to be a grandfather. He has his assistant make a list of people who are older than him, dyes his hair brown, and decides he and Nina should sell the home their children have grown up in if one more thing goes wrong with it. Termites strike the house two weeks later. George puts the house on the market without telling Nina, and sells it to the Habibs. At dinner, after a discussion on whether the baby's last name will be hyphenated or not, George reveals the house has been sold. Nina is livid, as she and George have to be out in 10 days and have no place to go. Having no place to go, the Banks stay at the mansion owned by Bryan's parents. As the MacKenzies are on a cruise in the Caribbean, the Banks have to deal with their vicious Dobermans, much to the chagrin of George, who is still obviously paranoid from a previous mishap with them. Nina begins experiencing symptoms that bring up the concern of menopause. After visiting the doctor the following day, they are given the opposite news: Nina is pregnant, too.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Elizabeth Warren's Birther Moment If you are 1/32 Cherokee and your grandfather has high cheekbones, does that make you Native American? It depends. Last Friday, Republicans in Massachusetts questioned the racial ancestry of Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic Senate candidate. Her opponent, Senator Scott Brown, has accused her of using minority status as an American Indian to advance her career as a law professor at Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Texas. The Brown campaign calls her ties to the Cherokee and Delaware nations a “hypocritical sham.” In a press conference on Wednesday, Warren defended herself, saying, “Native American has been a part of my story, I guess since the day I was born, I don’t know any other way to describe it.” Despite her personal belief in her origins, her opponents have seized this moment in an unnecessary fire drill that guarantees media attention and forestalls real debate. This tactic is straight from the Republican cookbook of fake controversy. First, you need a rarefied elected office typically occupied by a certain breed of privileged men. Both the Presidency and the Senate fit this bill. Second, add a bit of interracial intrigue. It could be Kenyan economists eloping with Midwestern anthropologists, or white frontiersmen pairing with indigenous women. Third, throw in some suspicion about their qualifications and ambitions. Last but not least, demand documentation of ancestry and be dissatisfied upon its receipt. Voila! You have a genuine birther movement. The Republican approach to race is to feign that it is irrelevant — until it becomes politically advantageous to bring it up. Birthers question Obama’s state of origin (and implicitly his multiracial heritage) in efforts to disqualify him from the presidency. They characterize him as “other.” For Warren, Massachusetts Republicans place doubts on her racial claims to portray her as an opportunistic academic seeking special treatment. In both birther camps, opponents look to ancestral origins as the smoking gun, and ride the ambiguity for the duration. Proving Native American ancestry is a complex, bureaucratic process. It’s more than showing up at the tribal enrollment office with a family bible and some black and white pictures. Many people are rejected, even when family lore tells them otherwise. Tribal citizenship depends on descent from an enrolled ancestor, and every tribe has its own requirements. In the Cherokee Nation, there is no minimum blood requirement, which would allow someone with as little as 1/128 Cherokee blood to enroll (that would be a great-great-great-great-great grandparent). Finding that remote relative is not conclusive, however. The ancestor may not have enrolled himself. Or he could have favored assimilation and counted himself as white. Or her application was rejected or she became ineligible for citizenship. Like Elizabeth Warren, I am a law professor who was born in Oklahoma. I am enrolled as a member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, which, along with the Cherokee Nation, has recently experienced great strife in defining what it means to be Native. In the past year, the arguments have escalated nationwide. Some members say that tribes should be composed only of members with high degrees of Indian blood. Others say it should be geographically based. And some others say citizenship should be based on history and culture, regardless of blood or residence. In my personal opinion, it’s whether you have a fry bread chef-lady as a relative. (In my family, I’m that “lady.”) Even within Indian Country, the meaning of race and citizenship is contested. And now the Brown campaign wants to dictate Warren’s own belief in her identity. According to the Brown campaign, Warren could not be Indian because she is blonde, rich and most of all, a Harvard law professor. Her 1/32 Cherokee ancestry, sufficient for tribal citizenship, is not enough for the Republican party. To most people, she appears as white as, well, Betty White, but to the Scott Brown campaign, she is just Dancing With Wolves. The Brown campaign asserts that Warren knowingly classified herself as Native American in the 1990s when Harvard weathered sharp criticism for its lack of faculty diversity. During this time, they argue, Warren relied upon this classification to enhance her employment opportunities and to improve Harvard’s numbers. Her faculty mentors at Harvard deny this and assert that the law school hired Warren without any knowledge of her ancestry. Admittedly, news of Elizabeth Warren’s Cherokee and Delaware ancestry comes as a surprise. There simply are not enough places in legal academia for Native American professors to hide. The community is tight and small. It’s like “Peyton Place,” but with academic arguments over subject matter jurisdiction. According to the Association of American Law Schools, Native law professors are only .5% of all law faculty — about fifty people out of 11,000. Native faculty are familiar with “box checkers”: those students and faculty who become Native for the temporary moment of admissions or employment. As soon as the application is mailed or the interview completed, the candidate returns to life as usual. The Cherokee Princess Grandmother served her purpose, and her memory is revived at convenient times. This merits a reexamination of the difficult question of what it means to be Native. Does that make the Chickasaw kid from Buckhead in Atlanta any less Native than the Navajo faculty candidate from Windy Gap? What does a Native even look like? It’s more than long black hair, feathers and beads. At the same time, it is more than checking a box. Someone’s subjective opinion about her heritage may conflict with tribal requirements for membership. The standards are not constant, and they may change with new tribal governments. This happened in my tribe in 2002, when the new chief decided that some members were not “Indian enough.” Even at home, the tribal government falls into stereotypes. For the Cherokee Nation, Warren is “Indian enough”; she has the same blood quantum as Cherokee Nation Chief Bill John Baker. For non-Natives, this may be surprising. They expect to see “high cheekbones,” as Warren described her grandfather as having, or tan skin. They want to know of pow wows, dusty reservations, sweat lodges, peyote and cheap cigarettes. When outsiders look at these ostensibly white people as members of Native America, they don’t see minorities. As a result, Warren feels she must satisfy these new birthers and justify her existence. Looked at from the inside, however, the Warren controversy is all new. When the Brown campaign accused Elizabeth Warren of touting herself as American Indian to advance her career, this was news to Native law professors. We have a good eye for welcoming faculty to the community and identifying promising scholars. We know where people teach, what they have published and we honor them when they die. Harvard Law School named its first Native American tenured professor? Really? In our small indigenous faculty town, we would have heard about it already. Kevin Noble Maillard is a law professor at Syracuse University and a member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. He is the co-editor of “Loving v. Virginia in a Post Racial World: Rethinking Race, Sex, and Marriage,” which will be published later this month. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses a controversy about Elizabeth Warren, an American politician, who claims to have Native American ancestry.

Some people think you must have a certain amount of Native American 'blood', while others believe it’s about being related to certain families or living in certain places. So, generally speaking, this article is about the tricky subject of how we define who is a member of a particular race or group, who gets to decide, and what happens when there’s a disagreement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What coffin did the group first find? Title: Buried Movie plot: On October 23, 2006, Paul Conroy, an American civilian truck driver working in Iraq, wakes up and finds himself buried alive in a wooden coffin, bound and gagged, with only a Zippo lighter and a BlackBerry phone at hand. Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of 5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die. Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him. His kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay 5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to 1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy. Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company.

Since -12 is multiplied by \\"s\\", we need to do the opposite. The opposite of multiplying is dividing.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C.

Article: Beijing's broadened ban on smoking in public places took effect Thursday, adding force to the effort to hold a smoke-free Olympics. The new rules extend existing anti-smoking regulations to more places, including fitness centers, cultural relic sites, offices, meeting rooms, dining halls, toilets and lifts. Restaurants, Internet cafes, parks, and waiting halls at airports, railway stations and coach stations are required to set up smoking areas. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \\"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers. He also said customers and restaurant owners would be asked for their thoughts on the new rule. Local authorities dispatched about 100,000 inspectors to make sure the ban was being enforced Thursday. Everyone has the right to dissuade people from smoking in public places, Liu Zejun, who works for the Beijing committee, said. \\"Citizens are encouraged to expose those who refuse to obey the rule by calling the free telephone line 12320,\\" Liu said. People caught smoking in forbidden areas will be fined 10 yuan (1.40), while enterprises and institutions that violate the ban will face fines of between 1,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. Smoking was forbidden in hospitals, kindergartens, schools, museums, sports venues and other places before the new regulations took effect. From Oct 1 last year, the city also banned smoking in its 66,000 cabs, and imposed fines of 100 yuan to 200 yuan on drivers caught smoking in taxis.

One of them asserts that out of all the different realms of the world, America has no mythological character that grants wishes. Their conversation is interrupted by a man (Wayne Robson) who claims that they are wrong, and that such a character does exist. The man goes on to explain that this character is a man named O.W. Grant, the son of a Leprechaun and a Cheyenne Indian. The man explains that O.W. is more so apt to play tricks on people, but that every so often, he takes a shine to some of them. When the two men ask this stranger just what O.W. Grant looks like, the fellow replies that he wears a red bow tie, and smokes a pipe carved in the shape of a monkey-head. As the man leaves the two, he mentions that O.W. can be found along Interstate 60. The two men go to a nearby map, and after looking over the roadways, think the guy they were talking to must have been pulling there leg, as there is no Interstate 60.The scene then cuts to real-as-life O.W. Grant (Gary Oldman), wearing a red bow tie, and smoking a pipe carved in the shape of monkey-head (just as the guy described). Going down a street, a guy in a parked car to his right opens the driver's side door, not realizing O.W. is about to pass alongside. O.W. falls from his bike, breaking the jaw on his monkey-head pipe. As the man apologizes and attempts to help him up, a truck comes along, running over Grant's bike, and destroying the man's cellular phone. The destruction of the cellphone causes the man to break into a fury, cursing how he wishes the incident had never happened. Grant asks if the man means the wish, and when the angered fellow replies positively, Grant places his pipe in his mouth, and green smoke envelopes the two of them.The scene begins again, with Grant riding along the same path (though his monkey-head pipe is now broken). Just before Grant reaches the car, he stops. The man on the phone inside, gets out of the car... and steps right...

Q:Information: - Acanthostega (meaning \\"spiny roof\\") is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapod, among the first vertebrate animals to have recognizable limbs. It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land. - The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \\"Carboniferous\\" means \\"coal-bearing\\" and derives from the Latin words \\"carb\\" (\\"coal\\") and \\"fer\\" (\\"I bear, I carry\\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian. - Eogyrinus attheyi ( from Greek eos , meaning \`\` dawn '' , and gyrinos , meaning \`\` tadpole '' ) was one of the largest Carboniferous tetrapods , and perhaps one of the largest of its family , Eogyrinidae , at 4.6 metres ( 15 ft ) in length . Eogyrinus appears to have been a powerful swimmer that moved quickly through the water by swishing its long tail from side to side . It may have been a predator , lying in wait for prey in much the same way as a modern crocodile . It was a lightly built animal , weighing around 560 kilograms ( 1,230 lb ) . Although probably better at hunting in the water , Eogyrinus could probably have also made a grab for prey passing close by on land . Fossils of Eogyrinus are known from northern England . Recent studies by Jennifer A. Clack suggest that the amphibian Pholiderpeton described by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 is the same animal as Eogyrinus . If this is so , then Pholiderpeton 's name takes priority . - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - Eogyrinidae is an extinct family of large, long-bodied tetrapods that lived in the rivers of the Late Carboniferous period.

Draw your line.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Magical World of Drawing Lines with the y=mx+b Formula Hey there, little explorers! Today, we're going on an adventure into the land of shapes, colors, and lines. Our magical tool for the day is the y=mx+b formula. Now you may be wondering, \\"What on earth is the y=mx+b formula?\\" Well, it's a magical way to help us draw straight lines. Remember when you played with your crayons and tried to draw a straight line? Sometimes it was tricky, right? But, with the help of the y=mx+b formula, we can draw beautiful straight lines every time. Let's learn how to use this amazing tool. Step 1: Understand what the formula means. The y=mx+b formula looks like a funny little code, doesn't it? But don't worry, it's not that hard. Let's break it down into smaller pieces. - y and x are like two friends who help us to find a cool spot on the paper to draw the line. - m is like a slide that tells us how steep the line we're going to draw should be. - b is our special buddy who shows us where to start drawing our line on the paper. Step 2: Find your line's y-intercept (b). The y-intercept (b) is where your line will cross the vertical line on your graph paper called the y-axis. It's your starting point for drawing the line. So we first need to find that spot (the y-intercept). Your teacher or parent might give you the number for 'b', or you'll find it in a math problem. Step 3: Find the slope (m). Next, we'll need to know the slope (m). This number tells us how steep the line is going to be, like how steep a slide is at the playground. If the slope is a big number, the line will be super steep, and if it's a small number, it will be more like a gentle hill. Your teacher or parent might give you this number too, or you'll find it in your math problem. Step 4: Draw your graph. Now, it's time for the fun part - drawing! Grab your graph paper, some colored pencils, or crayons. Start by drawing two perpendicular lines called the x-axis (horizontal line) and the y-axis (vertical line). These lines are like roads that help us find the perfect spot to draw our line. Step 5: Draw your line. Here comes the exciting part! First, find the y-intercept (b) on the y-axis – this is where our line will begin. Then, use the slope (m) to guide you as you draw the line. You'll need to go up or down the y-axis as directed by the slope, and then move to the left or right on the x-axis. It's like a fun dance move! And ta-da! You've now drawn a beautiful straight line using the y=mx+b formula. You're like an artist and a math wizard all at once! Now that you know how to use the magical y=mx+b formula, you can draw straight lines with ease, impress your friends, and make your drawings and graphs look amazing!"},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

A Better Way to Keep Patients Safe Not long ago, a few colleagues and I were discussing the challenges of improving health care quality and patient safety. We debated the merits of clinical benchmarks that payers and regulatory groups now require, crude proxies of quality care like giving antibiotics at certain times, ordering specific tests at set intervals or permitting our results to be reported publicly. One colleague, a devoted and highly respected clinician in his department, admitted that he found this growing list of directives from others exasperating. “I’m all for taking great care of patients,” he said, the muscles along his jaw tightening. “But how can some insurance bureaucrat or policy wonk who’s not in the clinical trenches know more about taking good care of real patients than someone like me?” Since 1999, when a national panel of experts released a landmark report on the high number of medical errors, insurers, policy makers and regulatory groups have been piling onto the quality-improvement wagon with ever increasing gusto. As a result of their enthusiastic efforts, hospital accreditation procedures and standards have become more rigorous, physician duty hours have been trimmed, hand-sanitizing gel dispensers in hospitals have multiplied and physician reimbursement has been linked increasingly with quality goals and less with the number of CT scans ordered. But few of these quality enthusiasts are actually caring for patients. And when a study in The New England Journal of Medicine last fall reported that despite all the efforts and new financial incentives, there was no significant decrease in patient injuries, these same enthusiasts were quick to point to the inertia and intractable attitudes of the medical “culture.” They noted that less than 2 percent of hospitals had installed comprehensive electronic medical records systems, doctors and nurses were routinely working in excess of limits on duty hours and few were paying attention to even simple hand-washing recommendations. It would take nothing short of an all-out legislative, financial and regulatory assault to change the system, many of them concluded. But what these “experts” failed to take into account was the same thing that has led to the downfall of countless other groups’ efforts to create sustainable change: They ignored the contributions of the people within the system. There have been a handful of grassroots endeavors, but most have focused on specific clinical dilemmas. Now that may be changing. Last week, nearly 1,000 surgeons, nurses and hospital administrators from across the country convened in Boston to discuss what is quickly becoming one of the most far-reaching of such efforts, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from the American College of Surgeons, the largest professional organization of surgeons. With the average American undergoing nine operations in his or her lifetime, the implications of a program that can improve how patients do after surgery are enormous. Based on an initiative in the 1990s that sharply decreased surgical complication rates in the Veterans Health Administration, the program was offered to all hospitals beginning in 2004 and is now used by surgeons at more than 400 institutions. Unlike most other quality programs, which gather data from insurance claims and coding data, it relies on information from patients’ hospital charts and follows patients for 30 days. A detailed analysis, along with statistics comparing results with those of all other participating hospitals, is then sent back to participating hospitals. “When you feed back data that clinicians can believe and tell them that there is room to improve, most will work to get better,” said Dr. Clifford Y. Ko, who has directed the program for the last five years. Surgeons and hospitals that discover, for example, that their rate of wound infections after surgery is higher than other participating hospitals have convened forums to discuss the issue, established electronic checklists to remind staff to administer timely prophylactic antibiotics and instituted mandatory training courses to improve how doctors and nurses care for patients’ incision sites before, during and after an operation. The efforts pay off. Within two years of adopting the program, almost 70 percent of hospitals decrease their mortality rates, and over 80 percent decrease their complication rates. Costs also decrease. Surgeons at Baptist Hospital in Miami, for example, reduced their rate of surgical incision infections to less than 2 percent from 4.5 percent and saved 4 million each year. Surgeons at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit ended up saving their institution 2 million annually by decreasing their patients’ average hospital stays by almost two days. “If a surgeon is doing several hundred operations a year and the department is doing several thousand, it’s difficult to keep track of all the urinary tract infections that patients might be having,” said Dr. Fabrizio Michelassi, surgeon in chief at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, which has been a part of the surgical improvement program for several years. “NSQIP has the power to let us examine complications and outcomes on a large scale, drill down and make systemwide changes, then see their effects.” The program has also slowly transformed the traditional hierarchy of surgery. Nurses are crucial members of the surgical quality improvement team at each site, and employees from administration, pharmacy and central processing and sterilization are sometimes included on review teams. “There isn’t anyone who isn’t a part of this process,” said Jennifer Ritz, a nurse who has helped to run NSQIP at Henry Ford Hospital since 2006. But not all hospitals have adopted the program. Many are already overwhelmed with the administrative demands of existing quality improvement programs, and the cost — a yearly fee of 10,000 to 24,000, plus the training and support of at least one full-time nurse — can be prohibitive. There’s also no immediate return on investment. “If you buy some high-tech surgical robot, more patients and surgeons are going to come to your hospital,” said Dr. Dennis Begos, chairman of surgery at Winchester Hospital, a 250-bed community hospital north of Boston that participates in the program. The American College of Surgeons hopes eventually to collaborate with regulatory and federal agencies so that more hospitals, and patients, might be able to benefit. And it’s working with participating hospitals to further refine the program. “We all know that it’s hard to move the quality improvement dial,” Dr. Ko said. “But NSQIP has shown us that it is really possible to change care and give our patients better outcomes. “And that quality improvement is local.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the challenges of improving health care quality and patient safety and focuses on the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) as a potential solution.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a \\"negative\\" movie review (OPT: -- negative; -- positive;).","completion":"Title: A Catastrophic Cinematic Disaster - \\"Blundering Beyond\\" Movie Rating: 1/5 Stars There are moments in the world of cinema when a film comes along that is so egregiously dreadful that one wonders if it's an elaborate joke, an intentional mockery of movie-making. Such is the case with the stunningly awful \\"Blundering Beyond.\\" This film is nothing less than a wonder in its capacity to repulse, an ode to poor craftsmanship. As a consummate professional, I try to maintain an open mind and approach every film, hoping to find at least one redeeming quality. Yet, for \\"Blundering Beyond,\\" I am disappointed to say that my search was futile. From the onset, the film's plot is so hastily sewn together that it barely makes any sense. It meanders through a maze of underdeveloped subplots, never quite settling long enough to allow the audience to grow interested in any of them. Honestly, it seems as though the scriptwriter penned the gobbledygook whilst battling a persistent case of amnesia, continually forgetting where they were in the story, and haphazardly cramming in contrived twists and turns to piece arcane fragments together. The dialogue blindly stumbles through clichés and tired, overused tropes, with a plethora of cringe-worthy attempts to mimic pop culture references ironically dating the film rather than making it relevant. This dismal script does no favors for an already hopeless cast as they try to breathe life into their one-dimensional characters. The acting, if one can call it that, is woefully inadequate, reminiscent of a poorly rehearsed high school theater production. Each performance is either ludicrously over-the-top or lifeless, with actors seemingly unable to escape the gravitational pull of mediocrity. It's evident that the director failed to communicate their artistic vision, allowing the lead actors to clash in style, resulting in a cacophony of painful performances devoid of any semblance of chemistry. The soundtrack is a confusing, disjointed mess that only adds to the perplexity of the film. The mixing is nothing short of amateurish, with unsuitable choices of songs that not only overshadow the on-screen action but also induce auditory whiplash. It's as if the music supervisor took three random CDs from a dusty bargain bin and used the selections indiscriminately, without a whisper of thought for tone or ambiance. As for the cinematography, it is mind-boggling how it alternates between nausea-inducing shaky cam and seemingly random pans and zooms. Scenes feel like they have been plucked from dubious YouTube video tutorials on how to wield a camera. Adding insult to injury, the editing is choppy and jarring, rendering entire sequences incomprehensible as the viewer can do little more than squint in a futile attempt to make some sense of the chaos unfolding before their eyes. Visual effects, for the most part, are virtually non-existent. However, the few times they are employed, they scream of budget deficits and an uncreative reliance on outdated technology. It's genuinely astounding how the visual effects here manage to be both minimalistic and garish, leaving the eyes assaulted and begging for respite. In conclusion, \\"Blundering Beyond\\" is a testament to film-making gone horribly awry. It's a painful and mind-numbing experience, leaving the viewer with a dizzying sense of disconnectedness from reality. Avoiding this film is not only a recommendation but an appeal for the preservation of one's sanity and any remaining faith in the sacred art of cinema."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Answer the following question: Information: - The IBM Personal Computer, commonly known as the IBM PC, is the original version and progenitor of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform. It is IBM model number 5150, and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton, Florida. - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS. - The expansion card (also expansion board, adapter card or accessory card) in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot on a computer motherboard, backplane or riser card to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. - Columbia Data Products (CDP) is a company that produced some of the first IBM PC clones. It faltered in that market after only a few years, and later reinvented itself as a software development company. - Clean room design (also known as the Chinese wall technique) is the method of copying a design by reverse engineering and then recreating it without infringing any of the copyrights associated with the original design. Clean room design is useful as a defense against copyright infringement because it relies on independent invention. However, because independent invention is not a defense against patents, clean room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions. - The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 19952001 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a boom and bust cycle, the Internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web, as exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s. - The BIOS (an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is a type of firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup) on IBM PC compatible computers, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware is built into personal computers (PCs), and it is the first software they run when powered on. The name itself originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. Originally proprietary to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems and the interface of that original system serves as a \\"de facto\\" standard. - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. - The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - Compaq Computer Corporation was a company founded in 1982 that developed , sold , and supported computers and related products and services . Compaq produced some of the first IBM PC compatible computers , being the first company to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer . It rose to become the largest supplier of PC systems during the 1990s before being overtaken by HP in 2001 . Struggling in the aftermath of the dot - com bubble bust , Compaq was acquired for US 25 billion by HP in 2002 . The Compaq brand remained in use by HP for lower - end systems until 2013 when , without warning , the Compaq name was quietly discontinued . The company was formed by Rod Canion , Jim Harris and Bill Murto -- former Texas Instruments senior managers . Murto ( SVP of Sales ) departed Compaq in 1987 , while Canion ( President and CEO ) and Harris ( SVP of Engineering ) left under a shakeup in 1991 , which saw Eckhard Pfeiffer appointed President and CEO . Pfeiffer served through the 1990s . Ben Rosen provided the venture capital financing for the fledgling company and served as chairman of the board for 18 years from 1983 until September 28 , 2000 , when he retired and was succeeded by Michael Capellas , who served as the last Chairman and CEO until its merger with HP. Prior to its takeover the company was headquartered in a facility in northwest unincorporated Harris County , Texas , that now continues as HP 's largest United States facility .

Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Epidemiologic studies suggest that ovarian hormones contribute to the development of breast cancer at all stages. Early menopause and premenopausal obesity reduces the risk while postmenopausal obesity and menopausal estrogen replacement therapy increases the risk. Combined oral contraceptives and Depo-Provera do not reduce the risk. It appears that estrogens and progestogens act through and with proto-oncogenes and growth factors to affect breast cell proliferation and breast cancer etiology. Animal studies suggest that estrogen causes interlobular ductal cell division and progesterone causes increased terminal duct lobular unit cell division in the luteal phase. Most breast carcinomas originate from terminal duct lobular unit cells. During pregnancy, these cells fully multiply. Their reproduction is also increased during the luteal phase. Yet, there is considerable interpersonal variation. No studies examining breast cell division have compared cell division rates with serum hormone concentrations, however. The peak of mitosis occurs about 3 days before breast cell death in the late luteal and very early follicular phases. Other research suggests that breast stem cell proliferation is linked to breast cancer development. Endocrine therapy reduces mitotic activity, indicating the estrogen and progesterone receptor content of breast cancers. Hormone-dependent breast cancer cell lines are all estrogen-dependent. Progesterone can block the estrogen-dependent cell lines which act like endometrial cells. The results of the various breast cell proliferation studies in relation to breast cancer are unclear and research identifying a molecular explanation would help in understanding the different findings.

It was an aircraft that in fact had not been hijacked at all. After the second World Trade Center crash, Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport. Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland.

In keeping with its eco-development, the machine uses the same amount of electricity as three lights. Inventor Jonathan Ritchey said, \\"The demand for water is off the chart. So people are looking for freedom from water distribution systems that are shaky and unreliable.\\" The machine, which is about 3 feet wide, is likely to cost PS800 when it goes on sale here in the spring.

Actress - and judge - Maxine Peake described it as \\"compelling\\". \\"This is so much more than a book about the monster that is Savile. It's about grotesque social attitudes towards the famous and money,\\" she said. The winner was picked from a selected shortlist by a judging panel comprising of Peake, authors Roddy Doyle and Doug Johnstone, artist Gavin Turk and journalist Suzanne Moore. 'Clear-eyed examination' Davies' book details Savile's secretive life and the author's own developing relationship with the TV presenter over the course of multiple interviews, as well as examining the many inquiries which have followed the discovery that Savile was one of the UK's most prolific sexual predators. Originally turned down by a slew of publishers prior to Savile's death, because it was deemed too controversial, it was published to critical acclaim last year.

Question: Is Alex'l child a boy or a girl? Movie title: The Witches of Eastwick Movie plot: Alexandra Medford (Cher), Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon), and Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) are three dissatisfied women living in the picturesque town of Eastwick, Rhode Island. Alex is a sculptor and single mother of one daughter; Jane is a newly divorced music teacher unable to have children; while Sukie has six daughters and works as a columnist for the Eastwick Word, the local newspaper. The three friends all have lost their husbands (Alex's died, Jane's divorced her, and Sukie's abandoned her). Unaware that they are witches, the women unwittingly form a coven where they have weekly get-togethers and share their fantasies about ideal men. A mysterious man (Jack Nicholson) arrives in town and stirs up trouble by buying the town's landmark property: the Lennox Mansion. The arrival of this enigmatic stranger fascinates the townsfolk, all except for Felicia Alden (Veronica Cartwright), the devoutly religious wife of newspaper editor Clyde Alden (Richard Jenkins), Sukie's boss. Felicia senses that this man (whose name is easily forgotten) is up to no good. One night, at one of Jane's music recitals, the strange man appears and makes a spectacle of himself, which leads to more gossip. After the recital, Jane receives a bouquet of flowers with the initial D written on it. This sparks Sukie's memory, finally revealing the man's name as Daryl Van Horne. However, as chaos over the name spreads through the crowd, Sukie's bead necklace inexplicably breaks and falls to the floor, causing Felicia (who had mocked Daryl's name) to trip down a large staircase and break her leg. The following day, Daryl sets out to seduce Alex. As he converses with her, he says insensitive, disgusting, and rude things every time he speaks. Appalled, she tells him off, refuses his amorous advances, and begins to walk out. Before she opens the door, he speaks to her, manipulating her emotions until she eventually agrees.

Given the question: Q: What debated therapy offers a potential method for replacing neurons lost to injury or disease? Choices: - cell production therapy - stem cell reduction - cell duplication - stem cell therapy A: The answer is:","completion":"Stem cell therapy. Stem cell therapy is a debated therapy that offers a potential method for replacing neurons lost to injury or disease. This approach involves using stem cells, which are unique cells that can develop into multiple types of specialized cells. In the case of neuronal damage, the goal is to introduce stem cells that can then differentiate into the needed neural cells, allowing for the replacement of damaged or lost neurons. The debate surrounding stem cell therapy is due to ethical concerns, particularly in the case of embryonic stem cells (which are derived from human embryos). Some people argue that the use of these cells is morally unacceptable, whereas others believe that the potential benefits in terms of treating neurological disorders and injuries outweigh the ethical concerns. Alternative sources of stem cells – such as adult stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (which are adult cells reprogrammed to resemble embryonic stem cells) – have been identified and may help to address some of these ethical issues. Nevertheless, stem cell therapy has shown promise in preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials for treating various neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries. Ongoing research is being conducted to optimize the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies for these and other diseases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Estonia Perhaps the most famous raid by Oeselian pirates occurred in 1187, with the attack on the Swedish town of Sigtuna by Finnic raiders from Couronia and Oesel. Among the casualties of this raid was the Swedish archbishop Johannes. The city remained occupied for some time, contributing to its decline as a center of commerce in the 13th century and the rise of Uppsala, Visby, Kalmar and Stockholm. The Livonian Chronicle describes the Oeselians as using two kinds of ships, the piratica and the liburna. The former was a warship, the latter mainly a merchant ship. A piratica could carry approximately 30 men and had a high prow shaped like a dragon or a snakehead and a rectangular sail. Viking-age treasures from Estonia mostly contain silver coins and bars. Saaremaa has the richest finds of Viking treasures after Gotland in Sweden. This strongly suggests that Estonia was an important transit country during the Viking era.

Taking a side in one of the most hotly contested cases of the upcoming term, the administration urged the court to scale back Colorado’s equal-access law so that baker Jack Phillips isn’t forced to \\"create expression\\" against his will and his religious beliefs. The brief argues that his free-speech rights outweigh the state’s interest in preventing discrimination in commercial transactions. The court is set to hear arguments, probably in late November or early December. ||||| House and Senate Republicans are throwing their support behind the owner of a Colorado cake shop who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding in a case headed to the Supreme Court. GOP lawmakers announced plans Thursday to send an amicus brief on behalf of Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop. Phillips is challenging whether the state can force him to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding under its public accommodations law, arguing that his constitutional rights to freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion are violated if he is required to make a wedding cake for Charlie Craig and David Mullins's marriage. The amicus brief, which has 86 signatures so far, will be filed with the court in the coming days.

The government cannot force you to speak where you would choose to remain silent. It cannot make a statement with which you firmly fundamentally disagree. These are foundational pillars of the American legal system and our Constitution.” Phillips, who will appear before the Supreme Court later this term, said he has lost 40 percent of his business and most of his staff for standing up for what he believes. His attorney, Kristen Waggoner, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, said Phillips should be able to retain his right to disagree and live consistent with his convictions. “We know tolerance is a two-way street and dignity cuts both ways,” she said. “We need to protect the right of all Americans to live and work consistent with their religious beliefs and not force creative professions to create visual art that violates who they are.” The Colorado Civil Rights Division, which is named in the suit along with the couple that was denied the cake, said in briefs there was no discussion between Phillips and the couple about what the cake should actually look like. “Petitioners acted not based on the design of the requested cake or the message it might have conveyed, but based on a blanket policy of refusing to sell a wedding cake of any kind to any same-sex couple,” it said. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In this news article, it talks about a man named Jack Phillips who has a cake shop.

At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine.

During the new year, the Nixon administration took what it called a \\"strategic counter-measure\\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The NME's review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a \\"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\\". In the US, \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show. Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word \\"nigger\\". Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility.

No school I have ever taught in has ever ignored spelling or considered it unimportant as a basic skill. There are, however, different ideas about how to teach it, or how much priority it must be given over general language development and writing ability. The problem is how to encourage a child to express himself freely and confidently in writing without holding him back with the complexities of spelling. If spelling becomes the only focal point of his teacher's interest, clearly a bright child will be likely to \\"play safe\\". He will tend to write only words within his spelling range, choosing to avoid adventurous language. That's why teachers often encourage the early use of dictionaries and pay attention to content rather than technical ability. I was once shocked to read on the bottom of a sensitive piece of writing about a personal experience: \\"This work is terrible! There are far too many spelling errors and your writing is terrible.\\" It may have been a sharp criticism of the pupil's technical abilities in writing, but it was also a sad reflection on the teacher who had omitted to read the essay, which contained some beautiful expressions of the child's deep feelings. The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to the errors, but if his priorities had centered on the child's ideas, an expression of his disappointment with the presentation would have given the pupil more motivation to seek improvement.

In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface.

Here's what it will look like: 354*r - 331*r = 667 Now, look at the left side, and you'll notice that we have two numbers multiplying with 'r'. We'll now combine those, like this: (354 - 331)*r = 667 That simplifies to: 23*r = 667 We're almost there! To get \\"r\\" all by itself, we just need to divide both sides by 23, like this: r = 667 / 23 When we do this division, we get: r = 29 And there you have it! The value of \\"r\\" is 29!

Computer Chess: Hollywood needs a new gambit when it comes to chess Throw a rock at the sports genre and you'll hit a film about baseball or football, or hockey, or racing. Odds are, you won't strike a film about chess. Chess isn't generally considered a stadium filler (although it can be). It's perceived as a game for eccentric intellectuals and elderly historians. It doesn't have the glamour or sex appeal of more sedentary sports, such as pool, as demonstrated by Paul Newman in The Hustler. Chess won't even fit snugly in to other genre films, where the banality of cards, for example, naturally lends itself to a seedy, gambling gangster underworld (Rounders), the exotic highlife of a casino (Casino Royale), or even more piquant, a combo of the two (Ocean's Eleven). But chess? It's just too uncool, and Computer Chess only serves to compound that. In cinemas this week, Computer Chess is the latest feature from mumblecore pioneer, director Andrew Bujalski, his first since Beeswax, in 2009. It's a fly on the wall, almost mockumentary-style dry comedy, following a computer chess tournament as it unfolds over a weekend. It could have been a proud starring role for the game, a film for the Magnus Carlsen era (the young prodigy and new World Champion described as the Harry Potter of the sport). Alas, neither the game nor the players are shown in a particularly endearing light. Sadly, this seems to be the fate of chess throughout the course of cinema. Reading on mobile?

On the seldom occasions it makes an appearance, it is usually merely a prop to emphasise intellect or cunning, or as a material analogy to illustrate a scheming mind. Take the classic example of Blade Runner, in which a battle of wits between Roy Batty and Dr Eldon Tyrell plays out by remote across a chessboard. It's a pivotal scene, and the moment Tyrell succumbs to defeat by unintentionally welcoming Batty in to his private quarters. But how does it translate to film? \\"Queen to bishop six, check,\\" is the initial attack. \\"Knight takes queen,\\" the retort. The final blow: \\"Bishop to king seven. Checkmate.\\" As Tyrell himself articulates: \\"Nonsense.\\" And sadly, to the vast majority of viewers, it most likely is. Chess enthusiasts might correctly identify this sequence from the Immortal Game, played by Anderssen v Kieseritzky in London in 1851. Similarly, Guy Ritchie weaves a nail-biting game of chess into the climax of Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, an on-the-nose metaphor for the action taking place, although Moriarty does offer some exposition for any audience members still confused by the moves: \\"May I remind you this is blitz chess – a single miscalculation will cost you the game.\\" Reading on mobile? Click here to view video Sometimes, however, it is courtship, not a battle. In The Thomas Crown Affair an extended chess encounter between the two protagonists is thick with sexual tension. To the uninitiated, an early castling by Crown probably looks foolish, but the chess is merely a backdrop for the sultry Vicki Anderson to flash a little side cleavage and raise the temperature. Indeed, Thomas Crown is shown to be distinctly hot under the collar, and ultimately the game ends off the board, with checkmate between the sheets … (Incidentally, this scene is hilariously parodied in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me) One of the difficulties for directors is to convey on film the momentous significance of movements on the board. Even for amateurs, but especially for the layman, easily visualising a chessboard is a rare ability, and a failure to visualise – let alone comprehend and interpret the positional strengths of the pieces – means any subtle shift in the power play is lost. In most other sports, a simple cutaway to the scoreboard telegraphs the balance of the game; and the actions of the players (netting goals, batting sixes or whatever) demonstrates the strength of one team or player over the other. The inability to portray chess in the same tangible fashion is doubtless one reason it's so often shirked by film-makers. Perhaps this is why one of the most successful integrations of chess within film is actually in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, where JK Rowling placed the characters on a giant board, and where a wrong move results in destruction and sacrifice. It is concrete, visceral and accessible – not to mention wonderfully realised by director Chris Columbus. Reading on mobile? Click here to view video None of this is to say that films using chess as their primary focus haven't been attempted. European cinema has produced many engaging pictures. Back in 1925, the silent Soviet Union short comedy Chess Fever starred the chess world champion José Raúl Capablanca, among cameos from other famed players, and in 1957, Bergman's The Seventh Seal saw the ultimate chess game as a man plays the grim reaper. Switzerland has comedy Ivory Tower (2010), France has The Chess Player (1927) and Dangerous Moves (1984). The Netherlands produced Long Live the Queen (1995), a beautifully poignant fairy tale, while Germany crafted Three Moves to Freedom (1960). In English language cinema, however, chess films are few and far between and, for the most part, woefully underwhelming. Probably the most successful and certainly the most straightforward sports drama, Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), is excellent, touching and well acted, charting the development of chess whizz Josh Waitzkin from anonymity to acclaim. It's an anomaly in film – a triumphant display, easily rivaling other sport biopics, where chess really is the centrepiece. A year later and a few rungs down the ladder hangs Fresh, in which a drug runner and prodigy chess player apply the game's tactics to find an edge in the real world. It's an enthralling movie, and the inclusion of chess is certainly more than perfunctory, but it nonetheless takes a backseat to drug dealing. And would a real chess film make the grievous error of messing up the gameplay? Escaping a check with another check is an invalid move! In addition to Searching and Fresh, the 90s saw a spate of substandard crime thrillers, each seeking to portray a sinister side to chess. Knight Moves (not to be confused with the decent 1975 Gene Hackman crime thriller, Night Moves) arrived in 1992, and was an overly sincere attempt to entwine the game with a serial killer noir. Unsurprisingly, sauciness and chess isn't confined to The Thomas Crown Affair. Indeed, sex and chess seems to be a persistent theme, the former being the one reliable antidote to all things deemed too dull for audience viewing. Between passionate bouts of intercourse, Knight Moves explores the egos behind chess, suggesting high intelligence and mentally deranged psychopaths are par for the course. In doing so, it strips aside the significance of the game's setting, and ultimately draws on the same box of tricks as every other psycho-killer thriller. Perhaps taking cues from the latter, director Jim McBride unleashed Uncovered, a film that makes every effort to prove that chess goes hand in hand with crime and intrigue, where the chess pieces are the clues to murder and are taken entirely literally, knight for knight, castle for castle. Release in 1994, it's unbelievably bad, but speaks volumes of the attempts to sex up chess for public consumption. An utterly bizarre sexual undercurrent throughout, way beyond ordinary 90s smut, includes one memorable scene in which lead actress Kate Beckinsale, 19 at the time, is reflected fully naked in the chessboard, her breasts literally overlaid upon the pieces. It doesn't get any more obvious than that: chess can be sexy! It's vexing because it could have been good, but Knight Moves is stylistically closer to an X-rated episode of Miss Marple than Se7en. Then there was The Luzhin Defence, in 2000, a chess romance and adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's The Defense, a novel loosely based on German chess master Curt von Bardeleben. The film is less to do with chess than with social distinctions and improprieties, with John Turturro's character, Aleksandr Luzhin, socially dysfunctional, scruffy and stammering. He's practically damaged by his genius, deliberately painted as an oddity. By association, chess is tarred with the same brush, as the domain of weirdos. More than a decade on and despite tackling a different genre, Computer Chess, unfortunately, isn't really any different, mumblecore or nay. The comic basis for the film is the social awkwardness and idiosyncracies of chess and programming enthusiasts. I'm not convinced that the mockery of these nerdy individuals is affectionate, or if it further reinforces the misplaced perception that chess is just the horseplay of freaks and geeks. In fact, that unfamiliar, oddball environment appears to be precisely the attraction for the director: \\"Given the nature of the story in Computer Chess and what we were trying to do, there was no imperative at all to be tasteful,\\" Bujalski told the New Statesman. \\"We could be as absurd as we liked and call as much attention to ourselves as we liked.\\" Oh, and it also features full frontal nudity (albeit in a uniquely surreal fashion). Films like Computer Chess don't do the game any favours, appealing to a niche within a niche and further estranging those who were already skeptical or disinterested. If chess is ever to reach a wider audience and greater popularity, it'll need something considerably more compelling to stack the board in its favour. Maybe it's true that board games really aren't spectator sports, but I can't help but think that we can do better than this. There's a better endgame out there. • Peter Bradshaw's review of Computer Chess• Computer Chess: watch the trailer Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Chess has struggled to find a strong presence in film, often relegated to a prop to emphasize intellect or cunning, or as an analogy for a scheming mind.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who is committed to the mental hospital?, using the article: On a beautiful morning in 1923, Clarissa Dalloway sets out from her large house in Westminster to choose the flowers for a party she is holding that evening. Her teenage daughter Elizabeth is unsympathetic, preferring the company of the evangelical Miss Kilman. A passionate old suitor, Peter Walsh, turns up and does not disguise the mess he has made of his career and his love life. For Clarissa this confirms her choice in preferring the unexciting but affectionate and dependable Richard Dalloway.

Question: What features do some flightless birds have that make them similar to birds that can fly? Context: Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone. A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change. At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

Possible A: fast food restaurant, plate, bowl, freezer, oven Why is \\"fast food restaurant\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Fast food restaurant\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the context and nature of KFC as an establishment. KFC, which stands for Kentucky Fried Chicken, is a well-known international fast food chain that primarily serves chicken dishes. By understanding this background information about KFC, it becomes clear why \\"fast food restaurant\\" is the most appropriate and common-sense answer among the given options. Let's analyze the other possible answers to further understand why \\"fast food restaurant\\" prevails as an answer that aligns with human common sense: 1. Plate: While a plate is indeed a dish or surface used for serving and eating food, this answer is too narrow and specific to provide a comprehensive understanding of KFC's overall purpose. It does not convey the concept that KFC is an establishment where chicken dishes are prepared and served. 2. Bowl: Similar to the \\"plate\\" answer, the term \\"bowl\\" refers to a container in which one can serve or eat food. However, it does not encompass the broad nature of KFC as a fast-food chain that serves a variety of chicken-based meals, not just those served in a bowl. 3. Freezer: A freezer is an appliance used to store food at low temperatures to preserve its freshness. Although KFC may use freezers to store ingredients and pre-prepared meals, the term does not convey KFC's overall function as a restaurant. Therefore, it is not an answer aligned with human common sense in this context. 4. Oven: An oven is a crucial appliance for cooking various types of food, and it is most likely used in KFC's cooking process, especially when it comes to preparing their signature fried chicken. Nevertheless, the term \\"oven\\" does not fully capture the essence of KFC as a fast-food restaurant, making this option less aligned with human common sense in comparison to \\"fast food restaurant.\\" In conclusion, \\"fast food restaurant\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it accurately depicts the primary function and nature of KFC. Other options, such as plate, bowl, freezer, and oven, may be related to the food industry but do not appropriately represent KFC's role as a fast-food chain serving chicken dishes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For example, you may choose to start by no longer cussing while driving, or in front of your nephew. Just pick one situation, and spend the first week avoiding cussing in that one. When you (or your helpers) do catch a cussing in this situation. Apologize and rephrase the sentence without any bad words. This may seem awkward, but practicing talking without cuss words is the only way you will get better. Consider creating a swear jar. With a swear jar, every time you swear you put a dollar in. Now, to make the swear jar really work, you need to really hate losing that money. And losing a dollar here or there just isn't painful enough emotionally to be a real deterrent. Especially if you give that money to a friend or a favorite charity. Instead slate the swear jar money for something you really hate, like a rival political party. If you are Republican, make a commitment to donate all swear jar proceeds to the Democratic party. If you are Pro-Choice, make a commitment to donate all swear jar proceeds to a Pro-Life group. Now that will really make you clean up your language. When you meet your goal for that week - for example, no swearing in front of nephew - reward yourself with something: a night out, a movie, a good book, a massage.","completion":"The article is about learning to change bad habits by starting small, like choosing not to say bad words in a certain situation, and using fun tactics, like a swear jar, where if you break the rule, you have to put money in which then goes to something you don't like, to help motivate you. When you do good, you get a prize!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Do Americans have morals ? That's a good question. Many people insist that ideas about right and wrong are merely personal opinions. Some voices, though, are calling Americans back to traditional moral values. William J. Bennett, former U.S. Secretary of Education, edited the Book of Virtues in 1993 to do just that. Bennett suggests that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett ' s book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values. But what are they? One of the most basic moral values for Americans is honesty. The well-known legend about George Washington and the cherry tree tells this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favorite cherry tree while trying out his new axe. When his father asked him about it, George said honestly, \\"I can not tell a lie. I did it with my axe.\\" Instead of punishment, George received his father's praise for telling the truth. Sometimes American honesty-being open and direct-can offend people. But Americans still believe that \\"honesty is the best policy.\\" Another virtue Americans respect is perseverance. Remember Aesop's fable( )about the rabbit and the turtle that had a race? The rabbit thought he could win easily, so he took a nap. But the turtle finally won because he didn't give up. Sympathy may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \\"The Good Samaritan\\" from the Bible describes a man who showed sympathy. On his way to a certain city, a Samaritan man found a poor traveler lying on the road. The traveler had been beaten and robbed. The kind Samaritan, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need. In no way can these brief descriptions cover all the moral values honored by Americans. Responsibility, loyalty, courage, gratitude and many others could be discussed. In fact, Bennett's bestseller-over 800 pages-highlights just 10 virtues. Even Bennett admits that he has only covered the surface. But no matter how long or short the list is, moral values are invaluable, they are the... Question: The story about a Samaritan suggests that - an American should show sympathy to others. - American ancestors are Samaritans. - travelers are so poor as to be helped. - help is the foundation of American culture.

(June 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Introduction: The title card is shown as a billboard behind which Wile E. Coyote is hiding, ready to chase the Road Runner. He starts the chase, until he runs into a large truck. Wile E. runs the other way, and the truck shows the credit. The chase ends in a win for the truck, and the Coyote emerges battered. A box with director Chuck Jones' credit then squashes him. The Coyote throws the box away, and the shot freezes: COYOTE - Eatius Birdius. He resumes the chase, which freezes to show the Road Runner: Delicius-Delicius. The chase continues down the road until the Road Runner makes a U-turn. The Coyote turns around, then stops. The Road Runner completes the circuit around, meanwhile, and beeps as the Coyote turns around, causing him to leap back. The Road Runner starts off down the road and loosens it from its hinge briefly. Wile E. points worriedly and displays an \\"EGAD\\" sign, then an \\"!!\\" sign. He drops them and thinks of his new plan. 1. Wile E. hides in a manhole, and as the Road Runner passes over him, he pops out and fires a rifle. The bullet and the Road Runner are shown in slow time, with the bullet closing to within a half-body length of the bird. Then the Road Runner turns to notice the threat, lets out a beep and gears into super speed. The bullet then brakes in puzzlement and falls to the ground. Wile E. picks it up, and then it detonates. Behind another rock face (in completely different desert scenery), Wile E. paces until he comes up with a new plan. 2. Wile E. leaps out into the road with \\"1 sheet ACME Triple Strength BATTLESHIP STEEL ARMOR PLATE\\" in front of him; even this cannot stop the Road Runner from barreling through it. The Coyote stares in puzzlement at the resulting hole, which shows only the scenery behind him where parts of his body should logically be, then walks...

Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects.

În ceea ce priveşte situaţia din Malaysia, doresc în primul rând să spun că suntem foarte îngrijoraţi în legătură cu atacurile asupra bisericilor dintr-o ţară cunoscută ca fiind tolerantă şi moderată. Translate to English English:","completion":"Regarding the situation in Malaysia, I would like to say first and foremost that we are very concerned about the attacks on churches in a country known for being tolerant and moderate. In relation to the situation in Malaysia, our primary concern is the ongoing attacks on churches that have been occurring. Malaysia, as a country, has historically been considered a place of tolerance and moderation. These recent incidents have led to growing unease regarding the safety and security of religious establishments, fostering an overall atmosphere of apprehension. It is crucial to examine the underlying causes that have contributed to this concerning phenomenon. Several factors might have contributed to these attacks, including religious intolerance, political issues, and a general rise in global extremism. It is essential to address these possible concerns in order to find a solution and prevent further conflict. In Malaysia, one issue that may have caused tension is the country's multireligious and multicultural nature. While most of the population is Muslim, significant minority populations of Christians, Buddhists, and Hindus also coexist. This diversity has historically been a source of strength for Malaysia, but it can also lead to conflicts or misunderstandings between different religious or ethnic groups. Political issues might have also contributed to the rise in attacks on churches. In some cases, politicians in Malaysia have used religion as a tool to gain support from particular religious groups, which could exacerbate religious tensions. Additionally, external influences, such as extremist ideologies from other countries, might have seeped into Malaysia and contributed to the radicalization of certain individuals or groups. To address these issues and help mitigate further conflict, there are several steps that must be taken. First, there must be a greater emphasis on promoting tolerance and interfaith dialogue between different religious communities. This can involve organizing events that bring together members of different faiths to discuss common values and promote understanding and mutual respect. Secondly, it is crucial that there is a focus on effective law enforcement and protection of religious establishments. Ensuring that perpetrators of religious violence are brought to justice will not only help protect places of worship but also send a strong message that such criminal acts will not be tolerated. Finally, there must be an emphasis on education and awareness about the importance of religious freedom and tolerance. Schools, religious institutions, and community organizations should work together to create and promote educational programs that celebrate Malaysia's religious diversity and promote understanding among all citizens. In conclusion, the situation in Malaysia regarding the attacks on churches is a cause for concern, but it is crucial to examine the potential underlying issues that have led to these events in order to effectively address them. By fostering a sense of tolerance and understanding and ensuring the protection of religious establishments, we can work towards a safer and more harmonious society in Malaysia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Russia was able to mobilize a larger army but could not put all of it into action simultaneously. The Russian mobilization system was ineffective and the expanding nation needed to be defended in many locations. A grand mobilization covering Russia's vast territories would have been unrealistic.

This negatively impacts their overall experience and satisfaction. 2. Unprofessional Management: The reviewer refers to management as \\"the most unprofessional\\" they have ever seen, which indicates a lack of proper conduct and ineffective handling of customer concerns. This further contributes to an unfavorable review. 3. Reputation: The reviewer is determined to spread the word about their experience to friends and those in the media, which could result in the restaurant losing potential customers. They even mention that their opinion is seemingly aligned with the concierge group at the Encore, further emphasizing the negative review. Although the service was described as \\"ok,\\" it is clear that the overall experience at Lavo was unsatisfactory for the reviewer, and this is a negative review pointing out multiple areas of concern."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This week could turn out to be pivotal for the Trump White House as both major parties get ready for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings. Question: Where is Elijah Cummings a Congressman from? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"Elijah Cummings was a Congressman from Maryland. He represented Maryland's 7th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served from April 1996 until his death in October 2019. He played a crucial role in standing up against the policy of separating families at the U.S. southern border and was vocal about keeping kids out of child internment camps.

Answer: In the states of Kentucky and Tennessee , the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to legislated dates in 1998 (Kentucky: March 31, 1998; Tennessee: December 31, 1998) and who chose electrocution. Question: what states has the electric chair Answer:","completion":"The electric chair has been used as a method of execution in several states across the United States since its inception in 1890. However, its usage has declined over the years, with many states opting for lethal injection as the predominant method of execution. As of now, a few states still maintain electrocution as a secondary option under specific circumstances. Here is a list of states that have had or currently have the electric chair as a method of execution: 1. Alabama: The state allows inmates to choose between electrocution and lethal injection. 2. Arkansas: The primary method is lethal injection, but inmates sentenced before July 4, 1983, can choose electrocution. 3. Florida: Since 2000, the primary method is lethal injection, but inmates who committed capital crimes before June 30, 1999, can choose electrocution. 4. Georgia: Lethal injection is the primary method, but those sentenced prior to May 1, 2000, can choose the electric chair. 5. Illinois: The state abolished the death penalty in 2011, but prior to that, it had used the electric chair until 1990. 6. Indiana: The state stopped using the electric chair in 1995 and switched to lethal injection. 7. Kentucky: While the electric chair is now retired, those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31, 1998, can still choose electrocution. 8. Louisiana: The last execution via electric chair was in 1991; the state switched to lethal injection in 1993. 9. Mississippi: Electrocuting is an option if lethal injection is deemed unconstitutional or unavailable. 10. Nebraska: The state changed its primary execution method from the electric chair to lethal injection in 2009. 11. New Jersey: The electric chair was used until 1963; however, the death penalty was abolished completely in 2007. 12. New York: The last electrocution took place in 1963, and the state stopped using the electric chair in 1995. It now has a moratorium on executions. 13. North Carolina: The electric chair was used until 1994 when the state switched to lethal injection. 14. Ohio: The state switched from the electric chair to lethal injection in 2001. 15. Oklahoma: Lethal injection is the primary method, but the electric chair remains a backup option if lethal injection is found to be unconstitutional or becomes unavailable. 16. Pennsylvania: The state used the electric chair until 1990, before switching to lethal injection. 17. South Carolina: The primary method is lethal injection, but inmates can choose electrocution. 18. Tennessee: The electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to December 31, 1998, and who chose electrocution. 19. Texas: The state stopped using the electric chair in 1982 and switched to lethal injection. 20. Virginia: Lethal injection is the primary method, but inmates sentenced prior to January 1, 1995, can choose electrocution. 21. West Virginia: The state abolished the death penalty in 1965 but had used the electric chair until then. It is important to note that methods of execution and applicable laws can change over time. However, as of now, the electric chair is either not in use or only a secondary option in most states.

Suggested answer: Grecian Formula is a men's hair coloring product in the United States. Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","completion":"While the suggested answer provides a brief introduction to Grecian Formula, it does not comprehensively explain how it works. Below is a more detailed and long answer to help you understand how Grecian Formula works and expands on its use as a hair coloring product: Grecian Formula, a popular men's hair coloring product primarily in the United States, is designed to gradually restore natural color to graying hair. Unlike most hair dyes that provide an immediate and intense color change, Grecian Formula works progressively over time, allowing users to have more control over the desired shade and avoid a sudden, dramatic shift in hair color. The key ingredient in Grecian Formula is lead acetate, although some newer versions use bismuth citrate as an alternative due to safety concerns with lead. These ingredients function as color restorers by reacting with sulfur in hair keratin, which is a fibrous protein that forms the structural foundation of hair. As hair naturally contains sulfur, these ingredients can selectively interact with the sulfur atoms in gray or colorless hair strands, forming colored lead or bismuth sulfide complexes in the process. Grecian Formula works best when applied daily to clean, dry hair. Each day of application results in a minor color change that, when accumulated over a period of several weeks, ultimately restores hair to its original, natural hue. The formula is designed to target only gray strands, so it blends with the user's natural color effectively. To maintain the desired shade, subsequent applications can be reduced to once or twice a week, depending on the individual's preference and hair growth rate. A significant advantage of Grecian Formula over traditional hair dyes is that it does not leave a visible demarcation line between the colored and new hair growth, as the color is restored gradually. Despite its popularity and effectiveness, Grecian Formula has faced some controversy due to the presence of lead acetate, which is a known toxic compound. Prolonged exposure to lead has been associated with neurological, cardiovascular, and reproductive health issues. However, the amount of lead acetate present in Grecian Formula is relatively small, and the risk of harmful exposure through skin contact is considered low. Nevertheless, the European Union has banned the use of lead acetate in cosmetic products, which has resulted in the utilization of alternative ingredients like bismuth citrate in some versions of the Grecian Formula. In conclusion, Grecian Formula is a hair coloring product that functions by gradually restoring the natural color of graying hair through the formation of colored complexes within hair keratin. Its progressive action allows for increased control, reduces the risk of an unnatural appearance, and avoids a sudden, dramatic color change that some people may find undesirable. However, the use of lead acetate has raised some safety concerns, prompting the development of alternative ingredients in other versions of the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sources differ on the precise year of Crazy Horse's birth, but most agree he was born between 1840 and 1845. According to a close friend, he and Crazy Horse \\"were both born in the same year at the same season of the year,\\" which census records and other interviews place in 1842. Encouraging Bear, an Oglala medicine man and spiritual adviser to the Oglala war leader, reported that Crazy Horse was born \\"in the year in which the band to which he belonged, the Oglala, stole One Hundred Horses, and in the fall of the year,\\" a reference to the annual Lakota calendar or winter count. Among the Oglala winter counts, the stealing of 100 horses is noted by Cloud Shield, and possibly by American Horse and Red Horse owner, as equivalent to the year 1840-41. Crazy Horse is commemorated by the incomplete Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota, near the town of Berne. Like the nearby Mount Rushmore National Memorial, it is a monument carved out of a mountainside. The sculpture was begun by Polish-American sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, who had worked under Gutzon Borglum on Mount Rushmore, in 1948. Plans call for the completed monument to be 641 feet (195 m) wide and 563 feet (172 m) high. Ziolkowski was inspired to create the Crazy Horse Memorial after receiving a letter from native Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear, who asked if Ziolkowski would be interested in creating a monument for the native North Americans to show that the Indian nations also have their heroes. The Native Americans consider Thunderhead Mountain, where the monument is being carved, to be sacred ground. Thunderhead Mountain is situated between Custer and Hill City. Upon completion, the head of Crazy Horse will be the world's largest sculpture of the human head, measuring approximately 87 feet (27 m) tall, more than 27 feet taller than the 60-foot faces of the U.S. Presidents depicted on Mount Rushmore, and the Crazy Horse Memorial as a whole will be the largest sculpture in the world. The memorial is funded entirely by private donations, with no assistance from the U.S. federal government. There is no target completion date at this time; however, in 1998, the face of Crazy Horse was completed and dedicated. The Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation regularly takes the lead in cultural, social and educational events, including the Volksmarch, the occasion on which the public is allowed into the actual monument grounds. The foundation generates most of its funds from visitor fees, with visitors numbering more than one million annually. The monument has been the subject of controversy. In Ziolkowski's vision, the sculpted likeness of Crazy Horse is dedicated to the spirit of Crazy Horse and all Native Americans. It is well-known that Crazy Horse did not want to be photographed during his lifetime and is reportedly buried in an undisclosed location. While Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear believed in the sincerity of the motives, many Native Americans still oppose the intended meaning of the memorial. Opponents of the monument have likened it to pollution and desecration of the landscape and environment of the Black Hills, and of the ideals of Crazy Horse himself. Aside from the monumental sculpture, Crazy Horse has also been honored by having two highways named after him, both called the Crazy Horse Memorial Highway. In South Dakota, the designation has been applied to a portion of US 16/US 385 between Custer and Hill City, which passes by the Crazy Horse Memorial. In November 2010, Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman approved designating US 20 from Hay Springs to Fort Robinson in honor of Crazy Horse, capping a year-long effort by citizens of Chadron. The designation may extend east another 100 miles through Cherry County to Valentine.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer.

Learn more ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — A divided Supreme Court kept Texas' voting maps largely intact Monday, dealing an election-year blow to Democrats by reversing earlier findings that intentional racial discrimination continues to stain several statehouse and congressional districts. The 5-4 decision comes nine months after Democrats had celebrated lower court rulings that invalidated parts of Texas' electoral maps and a revised voter ID law. But the voter ID law was also restored in April, and Texas Republicans now have another key victory in long-running battles over voting rights in a state with a booming Hispanic population. \\"Our legislative maps are legal. Democrats lost their redistricting & Voter ID claims,\\" Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted. The decision also dampened Democrats' case that Texas should once again need federal approval before changing voting laws, a requirement the Supreme Court eliminated in 2013 when it gutted the heart of the federal Voting Rights Act. In August, a federal court in San Antonio agreed with Democrats and voting rights groups that current electoral districts in Texas were tainted by earlier and intentionally discriminatory map lines first approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature in 2011. But Justice Samuel Alito said for the court's conservative majority that the lower court made a mistake by striking down two congressional and seven state house districts. The high court struck down one safe Democratic House district in Fort Worth because the state relied too heavily on race when it increased the district's Latino population. \\"We now hold that the three-judge court committed a fundamental legal error,\\" Alito wrote. The lower court ignored evidence showing that the legislature adopted districting plans in 2013 primarily to try to end the litigation over the districts, Alito said. The court's liberal justices dissented. \\"The court today does great damage to that right of equal opportunity,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote. She said her colleagues had blinded themselves \\"to the overwhelming factual record below. It does all of this to allow Texas to use electoral maps that, in design and effect, burden the rights of minority voters.\\" Democrats are outnumbered nearly 2-1 in the Texas Legislature and have long contended that unfair maps have accelerated that imbalance. In 2009, Republicans had only a slim two-seat majority in the Texas House. \\"The rules were changed today,\\" said Democratic state Rep. Rafael Anchia, chairman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus. Texas' congressional and legislative districting plans have been embroiled in court action for years, beginning in 2011. After the state's original maps were tossed out as probably unconstitutional, a three-judge federal court produced interim districting plans that were used in the 2012 elections. In 2013, Republicans who control the state government rushed to permanently adopt those maps to use for the rest of the decade, until a new round of redistricting after the 2020 census. But opponents criticized the adopted maps as a quick fix that didn't purge all districts of the impermissible use of race. \\"This is a huge win for the Constitution, Texas, and the democratic process. Once again, Texans have the power to govern themselves,\\" Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said. ___ Weber reported from Austin, Texas. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The Supreme Court in the United States made a decision about voting maps in Texas. They said that most of the maps are okay and can stay as they are. This is good news for the Republican Party in Texas and not so good for the Democratic Party.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who worked professionally in archaeology, and specialised in the Romano-British period? Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL. In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle.

The leather shoes were found in rubbish pits along with some pottery and bottles, the National Trust said. Further pieces of leather were recovered, and experts believe this shows the Quarry Bank gardener had moonlighted as a cobbler. The Upper Gardens project reopens next month. Initially it was thought the shoes could have belonged to young mill apprentices nearby. However, pottery and glass pieces found with them were identified as late Victorian or Edwardian, suggesting the shoes were made after the apprentice system had ended. Another theory was the shoes came from children who kept the garden wall stoves burning through the night. But the moonlighting gardener theory seems most likely, experts said. \\"We think one of the gardeners might have been supplementing his income fixing shoes for people from Styal village,\\" said Jamie Lund, an archaeologist with the National Trust. He added: \\"Maybe he threw away the ones that were beyond repair. Rubbish is a great giveaway because people throw things away and never expect them to be found. \\"It gives us a pure and unbiased view into the life of someone who was living and working at Quarry Bank.\\" Leather experts will examine the shoes and boots and the best pairs will be sent to the University of London for restoration.

Google Play Services plays a critical role in ensuring that all your apps are always up-to-date, enhancing your app usage and overall device performance. Sporting a seamless interface, it operates under the hood, staying almost invisible, which contributes to the clean, minimalistic appeal of Google's architecture. Perhaps one of its best features is the automatic updating of Google apps. It takes a lot of tedious manual labor out of the process, thus ensuring you always have the latest updates and security patches to Google's apps. Google Play Services also helps in authenticating Google services, synchronizing contacts, and providing users with the latest privacy settings for every other app on your device. The location-based services it integrates can help you use location data without draining your battery. However, this application comes with some minor drawbacks that prevent a full 5-star review. On some occasions, Google Play Services tends to consume more battery life than necessary. For users with limited battery capacity, this can arise as an issue. Also, as a core system app, it occasionally triggers unprompted errors that can affect the smooth operation of other applications. Despite these setbacks, the pros of Google Play Services considerably outweigh its cons. Taking into account the app's integral role in managing other apps, these minor issues are easily forgivable. Therefore, a solid 4 out of 5 stars is a justifiable rating for this application. A few tweakings, particularly on resource management, could propel it towards a perfect 5-star rating.

Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Vanucci concocts a scheme to pose as which movie director? Title: After the Fox Movie plot: The story begins in Cairo where Okra (Akim Tamiroff), using a bikini-clad accomplice (Maria Grazia Buccella) as a distraction, hijacks 3 million in gold bullion. The thieves need a way to smuggle the two tons of gold bars into Europe. There are only four master criminals considered able to smuggle the gold: a Frenchman, so crippled he can barely move his wheelchair; an Irishman, so nearsighted that he is arrested after trying to hold up a police station instead of a bank; a German, so fat he can barely get through a door â and Aldo Vanucci (Peter Sellers), also known as The Fox, a master criminal with a talent for disguise. Vanucci is in prison. He knows about the smuggling contract, but is reluctant to accept it, because he does not want to disgrace his mother and young sister, Gina (Britt Ekland). However, when his three sidekicks inform him that Gina has grown up and does not always come home after school, an enraged, over-protective Vanucci vows to escape. He succeeds by impersonating the prison doctor and convincing the guards that Vanucci has tied him up and escaped. The guards capture the real doctor and bring him face to face with Vanucci, who flees with the aid of his gang. Vanucci returns home where his mother tells him that Gina is working on the Via Veneto. Vanucci takes this to mean that Gina is a prostitute. Disguised as a priest, Aldo sees Gina, who is provocatively dressed, flirting and kissing a fat, middle-aged man. Aldo attacks the man, but it turns out that Gina, who aspires to be a movie star, is merely acting in a low-budget film. Aldoâs actions cost her the role, but he realizes that the smuggling job will make his familyâs life better. He makes contact with Okra and agrees to smuggle the gold into Italy for half of the take. Meanwhile, two policemen are constantly on Vanucciâs trail, and he uses several disguises and tricks to throw them off.

While the reviewer acknowledges some positive aspects of the meal, such as the good cuts of meat and the perfectly cooked filets, the overall tone of the review is focused on their disappointment with both the price and the quality of the scallops. The key phrases indicating the negative nature of the review include \\"not particularly impressive\\" when discussing the steak, and \\"real disappointment\\" in reference to the scallops. The author also set their expectations based on the reputation and class of the establishment, and was let down when their meal failed to meet those expectations. Furthermore, the author seems unsatisfied with the value provided by the dish, as they suggest that the 40 per plate price tag is too high given the level of quality. In summary, while the reviewer does acknowledge a few positive elements in the dish, the overall message is one of disappointment with the meal's quality and value, which labels it as a negative review.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Tea bag drinking is most Westerners' favorite way of drinking tea. Do you know how it came about? The tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea. This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go.

There is no one single way to become a generalized mediator. What you learn, where you look, who you network with are all going to be dependent on what type of mediating you decide to do. For example, if you wanted to go into family mediation (dealing with children, with divorce, domestic violence, and so on) you would need to be certified in behavioral or social sciences as well as in child development. Mediating workplace disputes would require knowledge specific to the workplace and to the laws and practices therein. It's even better if you have experience dealing with matters particular to that specific workplace, or type of workplace (for example, dealing specifically with factory issues, or mining litigation). Other types of mediation niches include: environmental, art, education, malpractice, criminal justice, landlord/tenant, gay/lesbian, and so on. The best way to get a feel for what is required of a mediator is to talk to someone who is or has done it. It's especially good to find someone in your specific area. While talking to someone who mediates art disputes could be informative, it won't have the same information needed if you're looking to go into workplace disputes. Go to conferences. There are tons of conferences devoted to mediation all around the world. Check and see if there are any in your area (for the U.S., for example, Chicago, New York, and various parts of California hold large mediation conferences yearly). Get a feel for how the system works. When you do meet with someone who is a mediator, you'll want to find out how the system works so you can be as effective as you possibly can. This includes finding out what the work environment is like, what their advice is for getting established, and who decides which mediators are established. Get a feel for what you need to know. Ask them about the types of laws, and rules you'll need to know, and education background that you'll need to have. Depending on the niche you decided to work in you may not need a master's degree, but it can definitely help your credentials. Proving that you have experience with the topic is important if you want to be successful as a mediator. Remember that if you wanted to mediate in Family Law, you would need a background (preferably a master's or a PhD) in behavioral or social sciences as well as family and child development. It's also not a bad idea to get a degree in conflict resolution, as universities and colleges are increasingly offering this opportunity, If you decided to be a civil, general equity, or probate mediator you would need to have at least five years of professional experience in your field of expertise as well as an advanced degree and a minimum of two successfully mediated cases within the last year, or an undergraduate degree and a minimum of ten successfully mediated cases within the last five years. Often if you get your PhD in your chosen subject the courts waive your need to have a certain number of successfully mediated case. Either that or the reduce the amount of successfully mediated cases you need to have. Mediation doesn't require any specific qualifications (except in Florida which has qualification requirements). There are certain qualification classes you can take, but usually these only give you the qualification that you completed the course, without guaranteeing that you are actually a certified mediator. You should go to school in your chosen field (art mediation, or law mediation, environmental mediation) and get a degree that shows you know that area well. Having a law degree can be incredibly useful, because it shows that you know and understand law, especially laws in a particular area. To get listed as a professional you typically have to have several years of experience with mediation (internship, community mediation volunteer, etc.).

Article: The natural instinct of your horse should be to move away from where pressure is applied - the same instinct humans have. Test this reaction in your horse by bumping them with an open palm near the girth where you would bump them with your calf. They should move away from your hand, possibly already in a side pass. Continue bumping your horse near the girth with added pressure if they do not respond to you. As soon as they take a step away, release pressure and reward them. Practice this until your horse needs only a single bump, or no bump at all (just pushing energy with your hand towards their girth), in order to move away from you. Put your horse on a lead rope, and if necessary grab a crop. Stand so that your body is positioned slightly behind the barrel of your horse’s body, and gesture with your arm or crop towards their shoulder. If they do not respond to this, then apply pressure on their shoulder. The goal is to get them to move away from your pressure by rotating their body around their back legs. If your horse turns away or simply walks in the opposite direction rather than crossing their front legs in a turn, grab the lead rope and hold them straight ahead. As soon as your horse crosses their front legs in a turn on the haunch, release pressure, drop your eyes, and reward them for doing what you asked. Continue practicing a turn on the haunch on the ground, so that your horse will respond to the same cues when riding. Similar to a turn on the haunch, a turn on the forehand is done when your horse rotates their entire body around their front legs by crossing their back legs. Accomplish this by standing near the shoulder (to block shoulder/forward movement) and gesturing towards the haunch with your crop or open hands. If they don’t respond without pressure, add a bit by pushing against the haunch with your open hands, or tapping them with the crop. Don’t remove pressure if your horse simply backs away or turns to the side. Straighten them out if necessary, but continue bumping with pressure until they take at least one step by crossing their legs. As soon as your horse achieves a single step in a turn on the forehand, release pressure and reward them for following your cues. Practice this over and over until your horse requires a minimal amount of pressure to accomplish a turn on the forehand. Stand next to your horse near the barrel of their body, using a crop if necessary. Bump the girth of the horse to tell them to move away; if they don’t move how you want, give them the cues for a turn on the haunch and a turn on the forehand. Continue working back and forth between your cues until your horse clues in and does at least a single successful step in a side pass. Reward your horse and release pressure as soon as they take even a single step in the form of a side pass. Continue doing this until they don’t need to be cued for a turn on the forehand and a turn on the haunch in order to recreate a side pass. Eventually they should only need to be bumped on their side near the girth. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article provides a detailed guide on training a horse to respond to pressure cues for various movements, particularly focusing on the side pass, turn on the haunch, and turn on the forehand.

So far, 25 surgeries across England have been granted approval by NHS bosses to shrink their catchment areas as they cannot cope. Some practices have already removed as many as 1,500 patients from their lists, including elderly widows, amputees, young mothers and – in one case – all the residents of a care home. So far, 25 surgeries across England have been granted approval by NHS bosses to shrink their catchment areas as they cannot cope (File photo) A further ten surgeries have applied this year to cut their registers and are awaiting approval. GPs say they are in the grip of a recruitment crisis and cannot provide safe care for the rising numbers of people moving to their areas. Some of the worst-affected surgeries are where the population is soaring due to migrants and elderly couples who need many appointments. On top of this, many GPs are retiring, moving overseas or quitting altogether and there is a shortage of new doctors entering the profession. Figures from NHS England – obtained by GP trade magazine Pulse – show that 15 practices were granted approval to shrink their catchment areas in 2013/14 and another ten so far this year since April. Officials would not identify individual surgeries but they are in areas including Surrey, Sussex, Greater Manchester, Leicester, Lincolnshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Dr Peter Swinyard is the chairman of the Family Doctor Association, which represents GPs. Dr Maureen Baker, the chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ‘This is an extremely distressing situation for patients and for GPs. Every patient should be able to see their family doctor when they need to, and GPs want to provide the best possible access and care for all their patients. ‘No surgery wants to de-register patients. This is still extremely rare and only takes place as a very last resort. Unfortunately, what we are seeing now is a sad consequence of the desperate shortage of GPs, with many practices finding it difficult to replace doctors who are retiring.’ So far this year, 15 requests had been rejected and six withdrawn. Patients who are struck off usually receive an apologetic letter from the surgery telling them they will have to register elsewhere. But there is no guarantee they will easily find another GP to take them on, especially in rural areas. Some of those removed by a practice in Watton, in Norfolk, now have to make 16-mile round trips to the next town to see a doctor. Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctor Association, which represents GPs, said: ‘This is people just basically saying, “We are not coping.” They are completely overstretched and struggling to find the medical staff to look after the patients.’ Katherine Murphy, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘The shrinking of GP lists is unacceptable. We must protect GP services and achieve real choice for patients. ‘Patients have no control over when they are going to be sick and therefore they must have access to a GP.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The NHS has approved 25 surgeries in England to shrink their catchment areas due to overstretched GPs.

The other involves the political and military leaders trying to contain the epidemic. Set in the small town of Evans City, Pennsylvania, the central characters are firefighter David (Will McMillan), his girlfriend, nurse Judy (Lane Carroll), and firefighter Clank (Harold Wayne Jones). David was a Green Beret and Clank an infantryman, both having served in Vietnam. The town has seen a number of violent events, including arson at a local farm by a demented farmer. Judy and David are very concerned, since Judy is pregnant. Meanwhile, heavily armed U.S. troops in NBC suits and gas masks, arrive in town, led by Major Ryder (Harry Spillman), who takes over the doctor's office where Judy works.

Article: The refrigerator’s dark, temperature-regulated conditions make it the perfect means of preserving freshly-opened flaxseed. Inside, the grains will be protected from heat and light, both of which can cause them to spoil prematurely. Best of all, almost any type of storage container can easily go into the fridge, provided it’s the right size. Whenever possible, the refrigerator should be your first choice for putting away flaxseed. Refrigerated flaxseed has the potential to last 6 whole months longer than flaxseed stored at room temperature. If refrigerator space is limited, just look a few feet higher. Stashing your flaxseed in the freezer is a wise move if you know you’re not going to get around to using it for a while, or you prefer to buy it in bulk. It will stay good for a year or longer past its listed expiration date, since the surrounding temperature is so low. There’s no need to thaw frozen flaxseed prior to grinding it or adding it to food. Hold off on processing your whole flaxseed until you’re ready to sprinkle some into a green smoothie or bowl or oats. Then, measure out the desired amount and return the rest to the pantry or refrigerator. It may be a little tedious, but it will greatly increase the lifespan of your supply. Freezing ground flaxseed may keep it fresh for as long as 3 months. Even so, the sooner you put it to use, the better. Anytime you’re grinding flaxseed, add it to your food or transfer it to its intended storage container without delay. The longer it remains out, the more likely it is to take on moisture. Even relatively dry air can kick off oxidation and lead to spoilage. Avoid grinding or opening a container of ground flaxseed in a steamy kitchen. Always reseal your storage container and return it to the refrigerator or freezer as soon as you’re finished portioning. When flaxseed spoils, the fatty acids deteriorate, causing it to take on a rancid odor. Open up the container and give the flaxseed a whiff to make sure it’s okay to eat. If it smells questionable, it’s probably best to throw it away and spring for a new batch. By contrast, fresh flaxseed will have a mild, nutty scent. Consuming spoiled flaxseed isn’t dangerous, but it may have an unpleasant taste or cause minor digestive issues. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article discusses the importance of preserving flaxseed in order to maintain its freshness and prolong its shelf life. It recommends storing freshly-opened flaxseed in a refrigerator or freezer to protect it from heat and light, which can cause spoilage. Refrigerated flaxseed can last up to 6 months longer than when stored at room temperature, while frozen flaxseed can stay good for a year or longer. It is advised to grind flaxseed only when needed, store it in a sealed container, and avoid exposing it to moisture. The freshness of flaxseed can be determined by its mild, nutty scent, while a rancid odor indicates spoilage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The \\"Facebookgeneration gap\\" has been highlighted in a new piece of research which shows that the average 22 year-old claims to have 1,000 or more friends on sites like Facebook. People in their twenties have more than 50 times as many digital friends as those who are over 50 years old, despite the popularity of sites like Facebook with the older generations, says a study conducted by consumer research group Intersperience. The news comes during the same week Facebook's second-in command, Sheryl Sandberg, is visiting the UK to deliver a speech at the London School of Economics. Facebook's chief operating officer is going to speak about how the social web has transformed people's friendships and relationships. The survey found that there was a clear link between people's age and the number of online friends they have.The researchers found that those aged 13 to 16, have an average of 450 friends on social networks, with girls having slightly more friends that boys.People in their thirties tend to have between 100 and 200 friends, while those in their forties have between 50 and 100. However, those using sites such as Facebook over the age of 50, tended to have 20 or less friends.The oldest person surveyed was 70 years old. Paul Hudson, Intersperience's chief executive, said: \\"Our research underlines fundamental changes taking place in British society as a result of finally entering the digital age.Half of the UK population are on Facebook now.In a social media context, a 'friend' means something different to a 20 year old than to a 50 year old.\\" He added: \\"Social networking activity is just one example of how different groups are adapting to the digital age at different paces.In this case, age is the determining factor - however in other instances it is not.\\" Answer:","completion":"Based on the article, which of the following statements is true about the number of online friends people have on sites like Facebook?

Death in the Afternoon: Step 3: Introduce the Death in the Afternoon cocktail and explain the origin of its name. Step 4: Describe its taste and ingredients. Death in the Afternoon is a champagne-based cocktail with a hint of absinthe – a potent combination that delivers a refreshing, slightly bitter taste.

This New Orleans-inspired drink puts a twist on the classic Sazerac recipe, substituting absinthe for the usual rye whiskey. To prepare this captivating concoction, first, rinse a chilled glass with absinthe and discard the excess liquor. Combine sugar, Peychaud's bitters, and a splash of water in the same glass. Finally, add ice cubes and stir until well-blended. The result is an aromatic, licorice-flavored delight with a touch of sweetness. Kalashnikov Shot: Step 7: Introduce the Kalashnikov Shot and explain its origin. Step 8: Describe the taste, ingredients, and method of preparation. The Kalashnikov Shot, inspired by the iconic Russian firearm, is a powerful cocktail that packs a punch. This intriguing drink combines vodka, Chambord (a raspberry-flavored liqueur), and the distinct taste of Galliano (an Italian herbal liqueur). To make the Kalashnikov shot, pour equal parts of vodka, Chambord, and Galliano into a shaker filled with ice. Give it a thorough shake and strain the mixture into a shot glass. The fusion of flavors creates an unforgettable experience, leaving you wanting more. Conclusion: Step 9: Encourage readers to explore the world of unusual cocktails and embrace the adventure.

What happens if a tourist can't pay the bill of giving birth in the USA and Canada? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"In what ways does the global healthcare marketplace influence the United States healthcare marketplace? The global healthcare marketplace influences the United States healthcare marketplace in various ways, including the following: 1. Cost and pricing: Global competition and pricing can impact the cost of healthcare goods and services in the United States. This may include the prices of medications, medical devices, and even services provided by healthcare professionals. Competition can drive down prices or lead to innovations that enable more cost-effective solutions. 2. Medical tourism: With an increasing number of patients seeking care abroad, the US healthcare industry is pushed to deliver high-quality services at a competitive price. Medical tourism is a result of global healthcare marketplace competition, and in return, it forces the US market to improve to retain domestic utilization of healthcare services. 3. Regulatory environment: Global standards and policy initiatives can influence the US healthcare system. This may manifest in the form of adopting guidelines from international regulating bodies, such as the World Health Organization, or through global agreements that may impact the availability of certain healthcare products and services. 4. Research and innovation: The global healthcare marketplace drives research and development in the medical field, as countries compete to be at the forefront of healthcare innovation. This can lead to collaborations between research institutions in the United States and other countries, potentially accelerating the development of new treatments or technologies. 5. Public health: As the world becomes more connected, the effects of a public health crisis in one country can quickly spill over into another. This can influence the allocation of resources within the United States healthcare system, as the country may need to address global outbreaks or prepare for potential pandemics. 6. Workforce issues: The global healthcare marketplace can impact the healthcare workforce in the United States, in terms of both supply and demand. The US relies on foreign-trained healthcare professionals to fill workforce gaps, and global competition for these professionals may impact the availability of providers in the United States. Additionally, healthcare professionals from the US may seek opportunities abroad for professional development or financial reasons. What happens if a tourist can't pay the bill of giving birth in the USA and Canada? In the event a tourist is unable to pay the bill for giving birth in the United States or Canada, various consequences may arise: 1. Negotiation: Hospitals may work with the patient to negotiate a payment plan, which allows the patient to pay off the bill gradually over an extended period instead of paying the full amount upfront. 2. Charity care: Some hospitals may offer charity care or financial assistance programs to help cover the expenses of uninsured or underinsured patients, based on specific eligibility criteria. 3. Debt collection: Hospitals may resort to debt collection measures, such as engaging a collection agency, filing a lawsuit, or placing a lien on any property owned by the patient in the United States. This may negatively impact the patient's credit rating and ability to travel in the future. 4. Impact on immigration: Unpaid medical bills can result in negative consequences for the individual's immigration status, such as being denied entry to the country in the future, or having difficulty obtaining visas or permanent residency. However, it is essential to note that the exact steps taken will differ depending on the hospital's policies, the patient's individual circumstances, and the severity of the unpaid bill. Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? These two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is about the ways the global healthcare marketplace can impact the United States healthcare marketplace, whereas the second question is about the consequences of a tourist being unable to pay the bill for childbirth in the United States or Canada. The second question does touch on the aspect of medical tourism and healthcare financing, but they have distinct areas of focus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Next question: when was call of duty advanced warfare released?","completion":"Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision. It is the eleventh major entry in the Call of Duty series and the first game in the franchise to be developed primarily by Sledgehammer Games. Advanced Warfare takes place in a futuristic setting, with advanced technology and focuses on the events of a Private Military Corporation (PMC) named Atlas. The game was released on November 4th, 2014 for various platforms, including PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. The release of Advanced Warfare was met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards its gameplay, graphics, campaign, and multiplayer components. The game's innovative movement system, featuring exoskeletons that allowed players to boost jump, slide, and dash, helped bring a fresh, new dynamic to the series. In addition to this, the game's storyline, which was penned by comic book writer and screenwriter John Macaluso, starred Academy Award-winning actor Kevin Spacey as the main antagonist, adding a touch of prestige and added depth to the narrative. Advanced Warfare also introduced a new game mode called \\"Exo Survival,\\" a cooperative multiplayer mode where players must work together to survive waves of enemy soldiers and drones. This mode added a new layer of strategy to the game, as players had to rely on their exoskeletons to maximize their potential in combat situations. The game's DLC content, which was released post-launch, expanded upon the content available in the base game, offering new maps, weapons, and modes for players to experience.

It turns out that the scene comes from the imagination of Dot, while she is sitting with the book. She goes out to play with Nelson the dolphin in his pool, and he teaches her how to stay underwater for long periods of time and to communicate underwater, as well as the history and evolution of sea creatures.

Dot walks up on land to talk with Tonga, but becomes upset as two boys, Alex and Owen, stand and throw sand on the whale. The boys say that they only want to push the whale back to the sea. Together, they try to push Tonga back to the water, but fail. They decide to gather as many kids as possible, in order to help the whale as much as they can.

Given those answer options, answer the question: I heard that Remy bought a shock collar and taught the pet to think before acting. And I was wondering Why did Remy do this? A:","completion":"A: Remy likely decided to use a shock collar to train their pet in an attempt to correct unwanted behaviors and establish a sense of discipline and control over the pet's actions. Before diving deeper into Remy's reasoning, it is important to understand the primary intent behind using such a training tool. Shock collars, also known as electronic collars or e-collars, are designed to deliver a mild electric shock to an animal when they exhibit undesirable behavior. The aim is to create an association between the behavior and a negative stimulus, ultimately reducing or eliminating the occurrence of that behavior. Some pet owners choose to use shock collars as a means of managing their pets' excessive barking, jumping, irritability, or aggressive tendencies. It is worth noting that this method is considered controversial, with animal welfare organizations advocating for positive reinforcement training techniques. Returning to Remy's decision to utilize a shock collar, they may have adopted this method for a number of reasons: 1) Fast results: In comparison to alternative training techniques, shock collars can yield immediate results. Remy may be looking to expedite their pet's learning process, ensuring the animal adopts acceptable behavior in a relatively short time span. 2) Control and safety: Remy may have concerns about their pet's behavior when they are not around, and using a shock collar can potentially offer greater control in managing such behaviors. This is particularly useful if Remy fears their pet may pose a danger to themselves, other animals, or humans. 3) Easily adjustable: Shock collars typically have a range of settings that enable the pet owner to fine-tune the intensity of the shock. Remy may appreciate the customizability of this device, allowing them to adjust the training experience to suit their pet's specific needs. 4) Last resort: It is possible that Remy has tried other training methods, such as positive reinforcement, but found them to be inadequate or ineffective in addressing their pet's behavioral issues. In this case, the shock collar may represent a last resort for Remy to establish the desired level of control and discipline. 5) Trainer recommendation: Remy might have consulted with a professional trainer who, based on their evaluation of the pet and its behavioral problems, suggested using a shock collar as part of a training program. Overall, it seems that Remy has chosen to use a shock collar to train their pet to think before acting due to the potential for immediate results, increased control and safety, adjustability of the device, and possible recommendations from a professional trainer. However, Remy should also be aware of the controversy surrounding shock collars and consider alternative, positive reinforcement-based training methods, as they may prove to be equally effective and are generally more humane."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, high heels are strictly a female fashion that is easily found in stores. High heels are the hit items featured on the runway and are widely worn by celebrities. For instance, in the popular TV drama, Sex and the City, the main character, Carrie, is a lover of high heels that in almost every episode, she purchases a pair of gorgeous 4-inch high heels. Carrie loves the heels so much that she even sets her email address as \\"shoe girl\\". This clearly shows how much modern women love high heels. Even though high heels are popular, they are not the most comfortable shoes to wear. In many ways, high heels have already changed the shape of people's lives. Doctors have warned that continuous wear can cause back pain and serious damage to the knees. Though it is yet to be proven, some psychological reports suggest that high heels can lead to mental disorder, as it is stressful to the people who wear high heels, in the sense that they have to bear the pain in every step. According to Mayann Los Russo, chief editor of Footwear News, high heels are desirable because they make people appear taller. She says, \\"I think it goes back to the idea of pain before beauty.\\" Indeed, some people feel that they always need to look appealing in front of their peers. Still, Dr. Casey Kerrigan, a professor at Harvard Medical School, warns, \\"It takes a long time to feel the effects.

Both albums feature contributions from live-band member Alessandro Cortini. Since the release of Ghosts I–IV, a 25-date tour was announced in several North American cities. Cortini and Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band. The lineup was initially to include Rich Fownes, but before any scheduled performances it was revealed that Justin Meldal-Johnsen would instead be contributing on bass guitar. Supporting acts for the tour include Deerhunter, Crystal Castles, Does It Offend You, Yeah?, Ghostland Observatory, A Place to Bury Strangers, and White Williams. In early June, a tour EP was released for free on the Nine Inch Nails website featuring four songs from the supporting artists and one from Nine Inch Nails. The files are DRM-free MP3s that are fully tagged, and included with the download are desktop wallpapers and a printable tour poster. The band headlined the 2008 Lollapalooza festival, the 2008 Virgin Festival, and the first Pemberton Music Festival. In May 2008, Nine Inch Nails announced that premium seating for all the upcoming 2008 tour shows would be offered in a pre-sale for fans who registered at the official Nine Inch Nails website.

Answer:","completion":"Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane were both accomplished literary figures who contributed significantly to the world of literature. However, while Hart Crane was primarily known as a poet, Natalia Ginzburg was not strictly a poet, but rather a novelist, essayist, and playwright. To best understand their roles and impact on literature, it is essential to analyze their individual careers and works. Natalia Ginzburg (1916-1991) was an Italian author known for her captivating novels, autobiographical narratives, essays, and plays that captured the essence of everyday life, relationships, and emotions. Born in Palermo, Italy, Ginzburg was raised in a family with a rich intellectual and political background. Throughout her life, she remained an active participant in Italian political and social issues. Though not a poet by profession, some of her works did incorporate poetic elements. She authored several novels, including \\"The Road to the City\\" (1942), \\"Family Lexicon\\" (1963), and \\"All Our Yesterdays\\" (1952), alongside numerous essays and plays. Her writing style was often characterized as simple, elegant, and intimate, reflecting her keen observation of human nature. Hart Crane (1899-1932) was an American poet whose writing primarily revolved around the experiences of modern life, love, and disillusionment. Born in Garrettsville, Ohio, he was deeply inspired by the works of other well-known poets, such as T.S. Eliot and Walt Whitman. Crane's poetry is infused with rich symbolism, powerful imagery, and a lyrical quality that garnered him a reputation as one of the most influential poets during the early 20th century. Some of his notable works include his debut collection \\"White Buildings\\" (1926) and his masterpiece, \\"The Bridge\\" (1930). Unfortunately, Crane's life was marred by personal struggles with alcoholism, depression, and tumultuous relationships, which ultimately led to his untimely death at the age of 32. In conclusion, while both Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane made significant contributions to literature, they were not both poets in the traditional sense. Ginzburg was primarily a novelist, essayist, and playwright who occasionally infused poetic elements into her works, whereas Hart Crane's primary focus was on poetry. Nonetheless, their unique literary styles and dedication to their craft have earned them a prestigious place in the annals of literary history."},{"prompt":"Information: - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - The Spanish Empire was one of the largest empires in history. It reached the peak of its military, political and economic power under the Spanish Habsburgs, through most of the 16th and 17th centuries, and its greatest territorial extent under the House of Bourbon in the 18th century, when it was the largest empire in the world. The Spanish Empire became the foremost global power of its time and was the first to be called \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\". - The Philippine Revolution (Filipino: \\"Himagsikang Pilipino\\"), also called the Tagalog War by the Spanish, was a revolution and subsequent conflict fought between the people of the Philippines and the Spanish colonial authorities. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. - The phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" has been used with variations to describe certain global empires that were so extensive that there was always at least one part of their territory that was in daylight. - The Cry of Pugad Lawin ( Filipino : Sigaw ng Pugad Lawin ) , alternately and originally referred to as the Cry of Balintawak ( Filipino : Sigaw ng Balíntawak , Spanish : Grito de Balíntawak ) , was the beginning of the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire . At the close of August 1896 , members of the Katipunan secret society ( Katipuneros ) led by Andrés Bonifacio rose up in revolt somewhere in an area referred to as Kalookan , wider than the jurisdiction of present - day Caloocan City which may have overlapped into present - day Quezon City . Originally the term \`\` Cry '' referred to the first clash between the Katipuneros and the Civil Guards ( Guardia Civil ) . The cry could also refer to the tearing up of community tax certificates ( cédulas personales ) in defiance of their allegiance to Spain . This was literally accompanied by patriotic shouts . Because of competing accounts and ambiguity of the place where this event took place , the exact date and place of the Cry is in contention . From 1908 until 1963 , the official stance was that the Cry occurred on August 26 in Balintawak . In 1963 the Philippine government declared a shift to August 23 in Pugad Lawin , Quezon City . - The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian dynasty. Bourbon kings first ruled France and Navarre in the 16th century. By the 18th century, members of the Bourbon dynasty also held thrones in Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma.

In addition to boasting an array of materials, Home Depot also offers various brands, colors, patterns, and price ranges, catering to different budgets and design preferences. Shopping at Home Depot for new flooring offers several advantages. For instance, they often have in-store promotions or discounts that can help customers save money on their purchases. Their knowledgeable staff can provide guidance and answer any questions about the different flooring options. They can also give helpful tips on installation and maintenance. Furthermore, Home Depot offers professional installation services for those who may require assistance. On the other hand, the other available options are not as suitable for the task at hand as Home Depot. Loft refers to a room or space directly under the roof, and it doesn't specifically relate to shopping for flooring.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.The 1832 exhibition of Youth on the Prow, and..., what would be the answer ?

The mascot, in this case, serves as the main storyteller, who brings the children together to share knowledge, teach them valuable lessons, or ignite their imaginations through the power of narrative. The other options, while potentially feasible in different settings, do not fit as well in the context of gathering around a campfire. Going to the movies would require a different setting, like a movie theater or a home with a television, and is therefore not suitable for a campfire gathering. Similarly, having the children engage in imaginative play might not best utilize the mascot's role as an entertainer or teacher. While eating s'mores and playing games could be fitting activities to engage in around a campfire, they are not directly related to the mascot's primary role of entertaining or educating the children. Thus, a long and detailed answer to the question would be: The mascot gathers the children around the campfire in order to read to them, either from a book or by sharing oral stories from memory, in a setting that fosters a sense of bonding, learning, and imagination among the attendees. This experience allows the children to connect with the mascot on a deeper level, learn important life lessons, and leave the event with lasting memories that enrich their personal and social development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: what does the v mean in court cases?","completion":"In court cases, the \\"v\\" stands for \\"versus\\" or \\"against.\\" It is used to denote the parties involved in a legal dispute or lawsuit, indicating the plaintiff (the party bringing the lawsuit) and the defendant (the party being sued). The \\"v\\" often appears abbreviated as \\"v.\\" or \\"vs.\\" in written case citations. The usage of \\"v\\" in court cases is rooted in the Latin term \\"versus,\\" which means \\"against\\" or \\"opposite.\\" This term has been utilized in legal documents for centuries to denote the opposition between two parties in a case. When writing or reading a court case's name, the plaintiff is typically listed first, followed by the \\"v\\" abbreviation, and then the defendant. For example, in the well-known United States court case Brown v. Board of Education, Brown (the plaintiff) brought a lawsuit against the Board of Education (the defendant) regarding racial segregation in public schools. Within different jurisdictions and legal systems, the format of case citations and the usage of \\"v\\" can differ slightly. For instance, in the UK and other Commonwealth nations, it has become customary to use \\"and\\" or \\"&\\" instead of \\"v\\" in criminal cases. The \\"v\\" remains in use for civil lawsuits.

Process: - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less toxins removed from the blood happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the proposed perturbation - less toxins being removed from the blood - can have both direct and indirect effects on the liver and its processes. Step 1: Less toxins removed from the blood When the liver removes fewer toxins from the blood, the blood may contain higher levels of harmful substances. This can lead to an accumulation of toxins, potentially damaging the liver cells and other parts of the body. Step 2: Effects on blood cleansing and nutrient processing With the liver working less efficiently in toxin removal, it may also have negative impacts on its other functions, including blood cleansing, nutrient processing, and waste removal. The liver might not be able to optimally filter the blood, which may affect the overall health and functioning of the body. Step 3: Effects on bile production and absorption of fats The liver is responsible for producing bile, which helps in absorbing fats into the bloodstream. If the liver is functioning at a reduced capacity, it might produce less bile or less effective bile. This can result in decreased fat absorption, potentially leading to deficiencies in essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. Step 4: Effects on glycogen storage The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen to be used as fuel when needed. A liver working less optimally due to decreased toxin removal might store less glycogen or have a more difficult time releasing glycogen as fuel. This can lead to issues with maintaining steady blood sugar levels and energy levels in the body. Overall, the proposed perturbation of the liver removing fewer toxins from the blood can have direct and indirect effects on the liver's functioning. These effects may include reduced blood cleansing, nutrient processing, bile production, and glycogen storage, impacting overall health and vital processes within the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The port was the point of departure for the Pilgrim Fathers aboard Mayflower in 1620. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: The famous ship that left Southampton's port carrying the Pilgrim Fathers was none other than the Mayflower. This historic voyage embarked from the port of Southampton, England, in August 1620 with the aim to transport a group of English separatists, later known as the Pilgrim Fathers, to the New World. The Pilgrim Fathers were a group of religious people who sought religious freedom and were fleeing persecution from the Church of England. They believed in attaining a pure state of Christianity and wanted to separate themselves from the Anglican Church, whose practices they disagreed with. The initial plan for the journey was for two ships to sail together from Southampton, with the Mayflower being accompanied by another ship called the Speedwell. However, due to the Speedwell experiencing leaks during the journey, both ships had to return to England twice. Eventually, it was decided that the Mayflower would continue the journey alone, leaving behind some passengers and transporting approximately 102 passengers and roughly 30 crew members. On September 6, 1620, the Mayflower finally departed from Plymouth, England, and set sail on its arduous and momentous journey across the Atlantic Ocean. It took the Mayflower 66 days to cross the treacherous waters of the North Atlantic before arriving at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on November 9, 1620. Upon their arrival, the Pilgrim Fathers drafted the Mayflower Compact, an agreement signed by 41 adult males on board that laid the foundation for the governance and laws in the new Plymouth colony. This document represented the first practical example of democracy and self-government in the English colonies of the New World. The journey and establishment of the Plymouth colony by the Pilgrim Fathers were significant as it marked the beginning of the British colonization of the Americas. The story of the Mayflower and the Pilgrim Fathers also occupies an important place in American history and is often commemorated during the annual Thanksgiving Day celebration. In conclusion, the famous ship that left Southampton's port carrying the Pilgrim Fathers in 1620 was the Mayflower, a vessel that played a critical role in the establishment of the Plymouth colony and showcased the determination of its passengers in seeking religious freedom and a new life in the New World."},{"prompt":"Fact 1: Scraping oneself on a contaminated object may cause infection.

Process: - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside - The nest is done. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more trees chopped down happens, how will it affect MORE/LARGER nests. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The process of nest building by birds is greatly influenced by the availability of suitable trees and other resources. It is an important part of the overall survival and reproductive success of birds. If we consider a scenario where more trees are chopped down, this perturbation can significantly affect the birds' nesting behavior and the construction of MORE/LARGER nests. The potential direct or indirect effects of this perturbation on the process can be analyzed as follows: Direct Effects: 1. Reduced availability of nesting sites: Since the very first step of the process is the bird selecting a tree, the chopping down of trees will directly impact their ability to choose suitable nesting sites. This can force birds to build nests in less desirable locations, which may not provide adequate support, shelter, or protection. 2. Scarcity of building materials: The chopping down of trees also affects the availability of resources like twigs and leaves needed for nest construction. This could lead to birds struggling to find the necessary materials, making it difficult for them to build larger and more elaborate nests. 3. Increased competition for resources: The reduction in available trees and nesting materials can lead to increased competition among birds for these resources. This competitive environment can make it more challenging for birds to secure enough materials to build larger nests, potentially affecting their reproductive success. Indirect Effects: 1. Changes in species distribution and behaviors: The loss of trees can lead to changes in the distribution of bird species and their behaviors. Birds that rely heavily on specific trees for nesting may be forced to use alternative nesting sites, which could potentially lead to more inter-species interaction and competition for resources. 2. Impacts on other ecosystem components: The chopping down of trees can have ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. As trees provide shelter and resources for other organisms, their removal can create imbalances in food chains and ecological interactions. Consequently, this could indirectly affect the availability of food and nesting materials for birds. 3. Altered environmental factors: The removal of trees can significantly alter microclimates, exposing birds to harsher environmental conditions. This could make it more challenging for birds to build nests that can withstand these conditions, leading to the construction of smaller or less sturdy nests. Overall, both the direct and indirect effects of the perturbation (chopping down trees) have the potential to considerably impact the process of nest-building by birds. The reduction in suitable nesting sites, scarcity of building materials, and harsher environmental conditions can pose challenges for birds to construct larger and more elaborate nests. Furthermore, these conditions can also influence reproductive success and survival rates, highlighting the vital importance of preserving tree populations for the well-being and sustenance of birds and other organisms that rely on them."},{"prompt":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I read the comments for these speakers before I bought them.

Under the Yuan Dynasty, China was incorporated with other regions such as Tibet, Mongolia, Korea, parts of Siberia, and Upper Burma into a vast empire. Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan Dynasty, sought to be perceived as both the legitimate Khan of Khans of the Mongols and as the Emperor of China. Despite facing challenges in being accepted as the Great Khan, Kublai Khan increasingly became associated with China and gained support as the Emperor of China during the Yuan Dynasty. This period marked the end of independent China, as mentioned by Van Praag, and the establishment of a diverse and extensive empire under the rule of the Yuan Dynasty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the Indian government has decided to demonetise 500 and 1000 rupee notes, why are they bringing back new 500 and 2000 Rs notes? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"The Indian government's decision to demonetize ₹500 and ₹1000 notes can be attributed to several reasons. Though these questions do not have the same meaning, they are closely related. I will address each question separately and explain their connections. 1. Why did the Indian government demolish ₹500 and ₹1000 notes? There were multiple key objectives behind the Indian government's decision to demonetize ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes in November 2016: a) Tackling black money: The move was aimed at curbing the circulation of black money (undisclosed and unaccounted income) and counterfeit currency. A significant portion of black money was held in the form of ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, and by invalidating these denominations overnight, the government intended to bring this illicit wealth under the purview of the formal economy. b) Digitization and financial inclusion: By banning high-value currency notes, the government sought to encourage the adoption of digital payment methods and promote financial inclusion. The temporary cash crunch that followed demonetization compelled people to explore alternative payment methods like bank transfers and mobile wallets, thereby boosting their overall usage. c) Counter-terrorism efforts: Banning high-denomination notes was also an attempt to disrupt financing channels for illegal activities and terrorist organizations. The government aimed at restricting the cash flow to these organizations by eliminating counterfeit currency from the financial system. 2. If the Indian government has decided to demonetize ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, why are they bringing back new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes? Although the government banned the older ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, it introduced new ₹500 and ₹2000 currency notes for several reasons: a) Maintaining cash liquidity: Completely abolishing high-denomination notes would have drastically impacted daily economic activities. Reintroducing ₹500 and an even higher denomination (₹2000) helped the government maintain liquidity in the system while they took steps to promote financial inclusion and digitization. b) Improved security features: The new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes were equipped with enhanced security features to curb counterfeiting. Some of these features include color-changing ink, intaglio printing, see-through registration marks, and micro-lettering. c) Boosting public confidence: Introducing new currency notes served as a measure to restore public confidence in the banking system and the economy. It demonstrated that the government was committed to addressing critical issues like black money and that they were undertaking steps to stabilize the cash flow in the country. In summary, while the question on why the Indian government demolished ₹500 and ₹1000 notes is related to the objectives of demonetization, the question about the introduction of new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes pertains to the government's strategy and efforts to continue addressing the aforementioned objectives while ensuring the stability and functionality of the economy."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the mushroom life cycle is the formation of a new fruiting body, known as a mushroom or toadstool, which emerges from the soil or growing medium. This occurs after the mycelium, a network of thread-like structures formed by the germinating spores, has successfully colonized the substrate and absorbed necessary nutrients. The mycelium forms a dense mass called a primordium, which then develops into a fully mature fruiting body. During the maturation of the fruiting body, cells differentiate into various structures such as the cap, gills, or pores, and the stalk. Once the mushroom reaches an appropriate size and stage of development, it releases its spores through the process of sporulation, which are then dispersed into the environment, carried by the wind or other means. This helps ensure the continuation of the mushroom's life cycle and the propagation of the species. This entire process is influenced by various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and availability of nutrients. The fruiting bodies will continue to grow and develop until they have depleted available resources or are no longer viable due to external conditions. After this point, the mushroom will either decay or be consumed by other organisms, returning nutrients to the environment and ultimately allowing for the growth of new generations of mushrooms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: What substances, which are distinct from acids and bases, form when ions form ionic bonds? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Salts Recall that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds. In these reactions, one atom gives up one or more electrons, and thus becomes positively charged, whereas the other accepts one or more electrons and becomes negatively charged. You can now define a salt as a substance that, when dissolved in water, dissociates into ions other than H+ or OH–. This fact is important in distinguishing salts from acids and bases, discussed next. A typical salt, NaCl, dissociates completely in water (Figure 2.15). The positive and negative regions on the water molecule (the hydrogen and oxygen ends respectively) attract the negative chloride and positive sodium ions, pulling them away from each other. Again, whereas nonpolar and polar covalently bonded compounds break apart into molecules in solution, salts dissociate into ions. These ions are electrolytes; they are capable of conducting an electrical current in solution. This property is critical to the function of ions in transmitting nerve impulses and prompting muscle contraction. Choices: - oils - vitamins - water molecules - salts A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"- salts The paragraph describes how salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds and how they dissociate into ions other than H+ or OH– when dissolved in water, distinguishing them from acids and bases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889. It was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof, and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Bergère, Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. The Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier, and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include Le Lido, on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. The Olympia Paris has presented Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland, and the Grateful Dead. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly visitors to the city.

In this context, it appears that their personal experience allows them to relate to others who might find themselves in the same situation. This understanding comes from having firsthand experience of what it's like to be the only caregiver present and having to attend to the needs and desires of the children. The concept of being \\"down to one friend\\" who holds a certain position might be a separate issue that the speaker is addressing. It could signify the potential change in their social circle or the priorities they hold as they navigate through life, given that they now have the responsibility of taking care of children. These kinds of experiences can lead people to reassess their relationships and develop a deeper understanding of their own needs and values. On the other hand, it could also imply that the speaker has lost touch with other friends who might have been in the same situation earlier. This could be because their friends' circumstances have changed, or due to the natural ebb and flow of friendships as people go through various stages of life. The speaker also appears to be commenting on the fact that they are currently the only adult at home with the children. This can be an overwhelming situation at times, as it involves being the sole decision-maker and caretaker in the household without the help of another adult. This might be one of the reasons why the speaker can empathize with others who are experiencing similar situations, as they have had firsthand experience with the challenges that it brings in terms of balancing the various responsibilities and demands placed on them. In conclusion, the statement \\"I understand what that's like because I'm home alone with kids who are clamoring for my attention\\" suggests that personal experience has offered the speaker insight into the feelings and challenges faced by individuals in similar circumstances. By being the only adult in the household tasked with managing the care and well-being of the children, the speaker has learned to empathize and understand what others in such situations must be going through."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who transitioned from commercial art towards his own original style of painting? Answer the above question based on the context below: Upon returning to Toronto, Jackson published an article about his and Thomson's experience in the Park in the Toronto Sunday World, included in which were several illustrations. After this initial experience, Thomson and another colleague, William Broadhead, went on a two-month expedition, going up the Spanish River and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today Mississagi Provincial Park). Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his own original style of painting became apparent around this time. Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, was lost during two canoe spills; the first was on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids.In fall 1912, Albert Robson, Grip's art director, moved to the design firm Rous & Mann. A month after returning to Toronto, Thomson followed Robson and left Grip to join Rous & Mann too. They were soon joined by Varley, Carmichael and Lismer. Robson later spoke favourably of Thomson's loyalty, calling him \\"a most diligent, reliable and capable craftsman\\". Robson's success in attracting great talent was well understood. Employee Leonard Rossell believed that the key to Robson's success \\"was that the artists felt that he was interested in them personally and did all he could to further their progress.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this case, is referring to the supposition that in industrialized areas, humans are killing more rats and mice. If this occurs, it may have both direct and indirect effects on the hunting process of owls. Direct effects: 1. Reduced prey availability: As humans kill more rats and mice in industrialized areas, the number of potential prey for owls is reduced. Consequently, it becomes more challenging for owls to find and hunt their preferred food sources, resulting in the need for them to broaden their hunting range or adapt to new prey species. 2. Changes in hunting habits: The reduction in small mammal populations may force owls to change their hunting habits in response to the availability of prey. For instance, they might need to spend more time and energy searching for prey, or they could start hunting more frequently during certain times of the day or year when the prey is more abundant. Indirect effects: 1. Changes in prey behavior and distribution: As humans kill rats and mice, the behavior and distribution of these prey species may change. This could lead to a shift in where owls are likely to find prey and a change in the preferred hunting grounds. 2. Ecological interactions: The loss of rats and mice in industrialized areas can have cascading effects on the local ecosystem. For example, it may lead to an increase in the populations of other prey species, which could, in turn, impact the owls' hunting process and prey selection. 3. Environmental factors: Industrialized areas might have other factors that influence the owls' hunting process. For instance, higher levels of pollution, more artificial light, or habitat fragmentation could affect the owls' ability to efficiently hunt for their prey. Overall, the supposed perturbation of increased rat and mouse fatalities in industrialized areas could have both direct and indirect effects on the hunting process of owls. They may need to adapt their hunting strategies and techniques accordingly or face challenges in finding sufficient prey to maintain their populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When we use other people as the measuring stick for our personal success and quality of life we are likely to be less satisfied. Social comparisons can provide useful information when we try to learn from others, but they also hold our perspective in a discontented position. Compare yourself less with others so you can be satisfied more. When you are focused on your big ambitions and future goals you might _ the daily pleasures that surround you. Learn to slow down and absorb the wonder and beauty around you. Stay present and focus on the task you're undertaking at the moment.

Would \\"The term includes cosmic , geologic , and organic history , but is often generically implied to mean human history .\\" be a reasonable answer? Pick from: (a). No (b). Yes Answer:","completion":"(a). No The proposed answer erroneously ties the reasons for historical change primarily to natural factors like cosmic, geologic, and organic history. While these elements can indeed influence the course of history, they're not the crux of what drives historical change, especially in the context of human history. The reasons for historical change are far more intricate and multifaceted, encompassing various social, political, technological, economical, and cultural factors among others. Social changes, such as shifts in societal structures, population dynamics, and cultural norms, play a significant role in driving historical change. For instance, the abolition of slavery in many regions came about due to societal changes in attitudes towards equality and human rights. Political changes too have their repercussions. The rise and fall of different regimes, wars, and revolutions have led to significant redirections in history. For instance, the French Revolution in the late 18th century not only transformed France, but also had profound effects on the course of modern history, spreading the ideals of liberty and democracy. Technological advancement is another reason for historical change. From the shift from hunter-gatherer societies to agricultural ones enabled by advancements in farming technology, to the Industrial Revolution driven by mechanisation, technology has historically been a potent driver of change. Economic factors also play a crucial part in shaping history. Economic depressions, growth, and recessions, the development of trade routes, and the discovery of new resources can drastically alter societal structures and drive history in new directions. The discovery of the New World, for example, redirected the economic focus of Europe and brought about significant historical change. Ultimately, the reasons for historical change are inextricably interconnected, with changes in one area often triggering changes in others. Hence, while cosmic, geologic, and organic history can influence human history, they do not encompass the complexity of reasons behind historical change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, on the Spanish mainland, Kelly concentrated on winning sprint time bonuses, battling with sprinter Jorge Dominguez, the BH teammate of leader, Laudelino Cubino. After regaining a minute in four days, the race reached the mountains where Kelly relied on help from Robert Millar of team Fagor-MBK to stay within two minutes of Cubino after the mountain trial to Alto Oviedo. He then finished fourth behind stage-winner Fabio Parra and Anselmo Fuerte on stage 13 to the ski-station at Cerler, cutting a minute and a half into Cubino's lead.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. If the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, are they closer or farther? David is interested in how electricity works. One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D. Hint: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. A:","completion":"Given the information in the paragraph, if the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, they are likely farther apart. Step 1: Identify the charges and their interactions. In this case, both charge A and charge B are negative charges. Negative charges repel each other. Step 2: Understand the relationship between potential energy and the position of charged particles. When two negatively charged particles are close together, they have a higher potential energy due to the repulsion between them. Step 3: Apply the hint about the decrease in potential energy. If the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, it means they are moving into a position where they have lower potential energy. Step 4: Conclude the relationship between distance and potential energy. Since the potential energy decreases, this indicates that the two charges have moved apart, making them farther from each other. This corresponds to the natural tendency of electric charges to move from a position of higher potential energy to a position of lower potential energy, such as in the example of water falling over a dam due to gravity."},{"prompt":"Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who invited Sönam Gyatso to meet him in the Amdo? ? During the reign of the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567), the native Chinese ideology of Daoism was fully sponsored at the Ming court, while Tibetan Vajrayana and even Chinese Buddhism were ignored or suppressed. Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.With the death of Zhengde and ascension of Jiajing, the politics at court shifted in favor of the Neo-Confucian establishment which not only rejected the Portuguese embassy of Fernão Pires de Andrade (d. 1523), but had a predisposed animosity towards Tibetan Buddhism and lamas. Evelyn S. Rawski, a professor in the Department of History of the University of Pittsburgh, writes that the Ming's unique relationship with Tibetan prelates essentially ended with Jiajing's reign while Ming influence in the Amdo region was supplanted by the Mongols.The Chinese Ming dynasty also deliberately helped to propagate Tibetan Buddhism instead of Chinese Buddhism among the Mongols. The Ming assisted Altan Khan, King of the Tümed Mongols, when he requested aid in propagating Lamaism.Meanwhile, the Tumed Mongols began moving into the Kokonor region (modern Qinghai), raiding the Ming Chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of Beijing under Altan Khan (1507–1582).

They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state. - Acts of Parliament, also called primary legislation, are statutes passed by a parliament (legislature). Act of the Oireachtas is an equivalent term used in the Republic of Ireland where the legislature is commonly known by its Irish name, . It is also comparable to an Act of Congress in the United States. - In England and Wales, a magistrates' court is a lower court, where almost all criminal proceedings start. Some civil matters are also decided here, notably family proceedings. They have been streamlined to deliver justice swiftly. In 2015 there were roughly 330 magistrates' courts in England and Wales, though the Government was considering closing up to 57 of these. The jurisdiction of magistrates' courts and rules governing them are set out in the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. - The Architects Act 1997 ( c. 22 ) is the consolidating Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the keeping and publishing of the statutory Register of Architects by the Architects Registration Board . It has the long title : An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects . It consolidated two Acts of the 1930s as later amended both by primary legislation and by Orders in Council implementing the EC directive on architects providing for the recognition of architects qualified in other EC states , and the changes which had been made by Part III of the Housing Grants , Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 . - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London. - The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough which also holds city status. It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End. It is to the west of and adjoining the ancient City of London, directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and its southern boundary is the River Thames. It was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London. Upon creation, Westminster was awarded city status, which had been previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster. - Under an Act passed by the UK Parliament in 1931, there was established an Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK), referred to in the Act as \\"the Council\\". The constitution of the Council was prescribed by the First Schedule to the Act. The Act made the Council a body corporate by the name Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom. It was habitually referred to colloquially by the acronym ARCUK. - The Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom. Its long title shows that it is a piece of omnibus legislation: - The Architects Registration Board (ARB) is the statutory body for the registration of architects in the United Kingdom. It operates under the Architects Act 1997 as , a consolidating Act. It began under the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 which gave it the name the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK).

Article: A lot of management training each year for Circle K Corporation, a national chain of convenience stores. Among the topics we address in our course is the retention of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart?, using the article: After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive. He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus. Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.

Fact 2: An insulated cup with a cover is great for keeping beverages warm. Given the two facts above, how do you keep a cup hot? A:","completion":"Given the information provided, one can deduce several ways to keep a cup hot using the principles of insulation and heat retention. 1. Choosing the Right Cup: Start with an insulated cup. These cups are often double-walled, meaning there is an inner and outer layer. The space between these layers is vacuum-sealed which reduces the rate of heat transfer, as there is no matter in a vacuum that would carry the heat away. This works on a principle of physics where heat transfer happens from a region of high temperature to a region of low temperature. Insulated cups reduce the rate of this transfer, keeping your beverage hotter for longer. 2. Using a Cup Cover: Using a cover on your cup further enhances the insulation effect. The primary role of the lid is to reduce heat loss through convection. Convection occurs when heat is carried away by the movement of fluids, such as air in this case. By blocking the surface of the hot beverage with a lid, we limit the exposure to cooler air and prevent the escape of the steam, which carries away heat from the beverage. This reduces heat loss and keeps the beverage warmer. 3. Preheating the Cup: Another technique often used to ensure that the beverage stays hotter for longer is preheating the insulated cup before pouring the hot beverage into it. This means pouring hot water into the cup, then dumping it out before filling the cup with the beverage. This process raises the initial temperature of the cup to prevent immediate heat loss when the hot beverage is poured. 4. Avoid Repeated Opening: The more times the cup is opened, the more opportunities for heat to escape. Try to avoid removing the lid too often or for too long - each time you do, you let steam (i.e., heat) escape and let cold air in. 5. Size of the Cup: Smaller cups or thermoses have a smaller surface area for heat loss and often, leads to the hot beverages staying warmer for longer. Larger volumes and surfaces areas tend to lose heat faster. 6. Using a Cup Sleeve or Cozy: If the cup becomes too hot to handle, that's a sign of heat escape. Cup sleeves or cozies insulate the outside of the cup, retain more heat within the beverage and protect the hands from the heat. 7. Cup Material: The cup material matters as well. Stainless steel cups are often the best at heat retention, but porcelain and ceramic are also good choices. By using these methods and principles, you can effectively help to keep a cup hot for longer periods of time."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

A sigma (σ) orbital (bonding) or a sigma star (σ*) orbital(antibonding) is symmetrical about the internuclear axis. Hence all cross-sections perpendicular to that axis are circular. Both a pi (π) orbital (bonding) and a pi star (π*) orbital (antibonding) possess a nodal plane that contains the nuclei, with electron density localized on both sides of the plane. The energies of the molecular orbitals versus those of the parent atomic orbitals can be shown schematically in an energy-level diagram. The electron configuration of a molecule is shown by placing the correct number of electrons in the appropriate energy-level diagram, starting with the lowest-energy orbital and obeying the Pauli principle; that is, placing only two electrons with opposite spin in each orbital. From the completed energy-level diagram, we can calculate thebond order, defined as one-half the net number of bonding electrons. In bond orders, electrons in antibonding molecular orbitals cancel electrons in bonding molecular orbitals, while electrons in nonbonding orbitals have no effect and are not counted. Bond orders of 1, 2, and 3 correspond to single, double, and triple bonds, respectively. Molecules with predicted bond orders of 0 are generally less stable than the isolated atoms and do not normally exist. Molecular orbital energy-level diagrams for diatomic molecules can be created if the electron configuration of the parent atoms is known, following a few simple rules. Most important, the number of molecular orbitals in a molecule is the same as the number of atomic orbitals that interact. The difference between bonding and antibonding molecular orbital combinations is proportional to the overlap of the parent orbitals and decreases as the energy difference between the parent atomic...

Step 1: Read and Analyze the Text Before I begin completing the text, I need to read and analyze the provided text to understand the context and setting. From the given text, it can be inferred that the main character is in a small, claustrophobic hallway in a mobile home and is being asked by Jake to enter a tiny bathroom. Step 2: Continue the Story Now that I understand the context, I will continue the story in a way that maintains the overall mood and style whilst providing a coherent narrative. Jake looked at me, a reassuring smile playing on his lips. \\"Don't worry,\\" he said softly, noticing my unease. \\"It'll only take a moment, and I promise it won't be that bad.\\" Step 3: Describe the Actions In order to build suspense and engage the reader, I will describe the character's movements and actions in detail. Hesitantly, I took a deep breath to steel myself and stepped into the cramped bathroom. The floor creaked under me, and I uncomfortably squeezed myself into the tight space between Jake and the toilet. The musty smell of the room closed in around us, only intensifying my anxiety.

I will include dialogue that reflects the characters' feelings and reactions to the situation. As I settled into the minuscule space, I let out a small, nervous laugh. \\"You weren't kidding about it being tight in here, huh?\\" I joked weakly, trying to break the uneasy silence between us. Jake nodded, still holding the brown bottle and facecloth. \\"Just focus on your breathing, and let's get this over with,\\" he replied, his voice steady and reassuring.

As Jake began to work with the mysterious bottle and cloth, I closed my eyes, trying to block out the overwhelming proximity of the walls around us. At last, after what felt like an eternity in that suffocating space, Jake finished his task. \\"All done,\\" he proclaimed, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me as we stepped back out into the restless hallway."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse. It was these same impulses, leading so invariably to success, that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man.

A word, a personal word from him to the district attorney, or the judge, would be enough.

Explanation: Mr. Thorndike, as per the given passage, intends to interfere on behalf of young Spear, who was to be sentenced for theft on this day. For this purpose, he gives the order to his chauffeur to halt at the Court of General Sessions. The passage implies that Mr. Thorndike, a man of influence, plans to have a word with the district attorney or the judge to possibly affect the outcome of young Spear's sentencing. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"What did Mr. Thorndike want to do at the Court of General Sessions?\\" is \\"Speak with the district attorney or judge personally\\".

Manchester has a notable place in the history of Marxism and left-wing politics; being the subject of Friedrich Engels' work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester, and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library. The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy. Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that \\"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\\". An American visitor taken to Manchester's blackspots saw \\"wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments\\".The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself...

As a young woman in her early twenties, cabaret singer Ann (Claire Danes) arrives at the spacious Newport, Rhode Island, home of her best friend Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer), who is on the verge of getting married to Karl Ross (Timothy Kiefer). Lila's brother (and Ann's college friend) Buddy (Hugh Dancy) introduces her to Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), a young doctor and the son of a former family servant. Buddy tells Ann his sister always has adored Harris, and expresses his concern that she's marrying another man out of a sense of duty rather than love. Inebriated, Buddy passes out, and as Ann and Harris chat they find themselves bonding. On Lila's wedding day, she confesses to Ann that she confronted Harris with her feelings for him and he rebuffed her, so she goes along with the ceremony as planned and marries Karl.

Movie title: Return to Oz Context: In October 1899, six months after returning home from the Land of Oz, Dorothy Gale is melancholic. Her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry take her to Dr. Worley, known for his electrotherapy treatments, and leave her under the care of Nurse Wilson. During a thunderstorm, the lab suffers a blackout and Dorothy is saved by a mysterious girl. They escape with Nurse Wilson in pursuit, and fall into a river. Dorothy clambers aboard a chicken coop, but the other girl appears to have vanished underwater. Upon awakening, Dorothy finds herself back in Oz with her chicken Billina, who can now talk. They find the Emerald City in ruins and its citizens (including the Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion) turned to stone. Pursued by Wheelers (humans who have wheels instead of hands and feet), Dorothy and Billina hide in a room accessed by a glyph key Billina earlier had found. They meet a mechanical man, Tik-Tok, who explains that King Scarecrow has been captured by the Nome King, who is responsible for the Emerald City's destruction. The three visit princess Mombi in hopes of getting more information, but she is working with the Nome King and imprisons them. Dorothy, Billina, and Tik-Tok meet Jack Pumpkinhead, who explains he was brought to life via Mombi's Powder of Life. Dorothy uses the Powder of Life to vivify the Gump, the head of a moose-like animal whose body they put together using two sofas, palm leaves, a broom, and rope. Using the Gump as transport, the group escapes and flies across the Deadly Desert to reach the Nome King's mountain. In his underground domain, the Nome King tells Dorothy that the Scarecrow stole the emeralds from him to build the Emerald City, and should be punished. He does not listen when Dorothy protests that the emeralds preceded the Scarecrow at the city.

Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Return to Oz,\\" the Scarecrow was turned into an ornament by the Nome King. The Nome King accused Scarecrow of stealing emeralds from him to build the Emerald City and punished him by transforming him into an ornament. Dorothy and her friends were given three guesses each to identify which ornament the Scarecrow had become, or else they too would be turned into ornaments. The Gump, Jack Pumpkinhead, and Tik-Tok all failed in their attempts, ultimately being turned into ornaments themselves. The Nome King then gave Dorothy an extra chance to guess correctly but used this as an opportunity to deceive her by making the Scarecrow's ornament form seemingly more challenging to discern. Despite the Nome King's deception, Dorothy successfully identified the Scarecrow's ornament form by recognizing a faint emerald glow as a hint to his presence. Upon correctly guessing the ornament, the Scarecrow was transformed back into his original form, allowing Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and their friends to continue their quest to save the Land of Oz from the Nome King's clutches and restore the Emerald City to its former glory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer. While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. The French have always wanted to know what it means to be a French­man. Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d. Question: \\"In what year did the Romans travel from Gual to France?\\" Answer: \\"125 BC\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

What is the answer to this question? what is the verse form used in sir gawain called?","completion":"The verse form used in \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight” is known as Alliterative Revival. This refers to a method of writing that arrived around the 14th century, which took influence from Old English styles of alliteration. The poem itself is written in stanzas of unequal length- all ending in a short bob and wheel. To explain further, Alliterative Revival is a form of poetry that uses alliteration as the main structural element of a line, along with a particular rhythm. 'Alliteration' refers to the repetition of initial consonant sounds in neighbouring words or stressed syllables, which generates a natural rhythm on the page and in reading aloud. As for the 'bob and wheel', it's a subset of Alliterative Revival, but unique to Middle English alliterative verse and became highly prominent in \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight”. The stanza ends with this compact chunk known as the 'bob and wheel': the bob is simply a very short line, often only two or three syllables, followed by the wheel, which consists of four lines that rhyme together. The rhyme scheme for these lines is typically ABABA. For example, the first stanza ends: \\"But of deeds of arms and derring do In Vance the king greatly stood out.\\" Bob: \\"With a broad banner borne aloft,\\" Wheel: \\"Boldly he played his part, this bear, Killer of men in his cruel rage, Fierce and furious, never flinching.\\" This combination of alliteration and established rhyme scheme helps to build the rhythm and epic quality that the children of the Alliterative Revival, including \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,\\" are known for. Hence, that is an in-depth explanation for the verse-form for \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\\" Not only does it have a unique structure, but it ties into the tradition of oral storytelling, where alliteration and rhyme helped storytellers to remember their lengthy tales."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sometimes cats and dogs may not like each other at first, but don't worry - with some patience and fun steps, we can help them become friends. Are you ready? Let's get started! Step 1: Let the cat (the kitty friend) set the pace. Our kitty friend is usually a bit more shy than our doggy friend. They might feel scared because they don't know the doggy well yet. So, we have to make sure that the cat feels safe and comfy while meeting the dog. Letting the kitty friend take their time to explore and move closer to the dog will make them feel secure. It's like how we make friends, we have to wait and get to know each other before we become best buddies. Step 2: Keep your dog (the doggy friend) on a loose leash. To help our doggy friend stay calm and give them the freedom to move, we'll use a long, loose leash. This will help the doggy feel happy while making sure they don't chase or scare the kitty friend. Remember, we want them to feel safe and be friends! Step 3: Be ready to react if your doggy tries to chase the kitty. Sometimes, our doggy friends get very excited and may want to play with the kitty right away. But they might play too rough! If you see your doggy friend moving too fast or trying to chase the kitty, gently hold the leash and guide the doggy to stop. This way, we can protect our kitty friend and continue with their nice and slow introduction. Step 4: Continue this practice for a few weeks. Becoming friends takes time! Just like how we make new friends at school, our doggy and kitty friends need time to get comfortable with each other. So, we'll keep practicing these steps every day for a few weeks, and they will learn that they can be friends without being scared or rough with each other. Step 5: When you feel absolutely confident, take your dog off the leash. After a few weeks of helping our doggy and kitty friends practice, we'll start to see that they are getting along better! When you're sure they are happy, safe, and calm together, we can let the doggy off the leash. Be sure to watch them carefully to make sure they continue to play gently and don't hurt our kitty friend. Now, you're all set! It's time to use these steps to help your doggy and kitty friends become the bestest buddies ever. And remember, always be kind and patient with them as they learn.

Wear protective clothing.","completion":"Title: Defending Your Skin: Comprehensive Steps to Avoid Harmful UV Exposure Introduction: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a type of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun, poses serious health risks to human beings. Prolonged and unprotected exposure to UV radiation can cause skin cancer, wrinkles, sunburn, eye damage, and suppression of the immune system. With the rapid depletion of the ozone layer, the risk of harmful UV exposure has escalated. While sunlight plays a crucial role in nurturing our health and well-being, it is imperative to take appropriate measures to avoid the negative impacts of UV exposure. This article will discuss how to shield oneself from harmful UV rays by wearing sunscreen, using protective clothing, and adopting other preventive practices. 1. Wear Sunscreen: Sunscreen acts as the primary line of defense against the harmful effects of UV exposure. It is essential to choose a sunscreen with broad-spectrum protection, which shields the skin against both UVA and UVB radiation. UVA rays are known to trigger aging and may contribute to the development of skin cancers, while UVB rays are the primary cause of sunburn. (a) How to choose the right sunscreen: - Opt for a sunscreen with an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of at least 30, which will block 97% of UVB radiation. - Look for the terms \\"broad-spectrum\\" or \\"UVA/UVB protection\\" on the label to ensure all-around protection from both UVA and UVB rays. - Consider water-resistant sunscreens if engaging in water-based activities or if excessive sweating is anticipated. (b) How to apply sunscreen correctly: - Apply sunscreen 15-30 minutes before stepping out into the sun. - Use generous amounts of sunscreen and cover all exposed areas, including the face, neck, ears, and top of the feet. - Reapply sunscreen every two hours or after swimming, sweating, or towel-drying. - Do not forget to apply lip balm with SPF for additional protection. 2. Wear Protective Clothing: UV-protective clothing is another essential component in the defense against harmful solar radiation. Incorporate the following into your outfits when venturing outdoors: (a) Long-sleeved shirts and pants: Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants to cover maximum skin area, minimizing direct UV exposure. Opt for tightly woven fabrics that prevent UV rays from penetrating the material and reaching the skin. (b) Hats with wide brims: A hat with a 3-inch or larger brim protects your face, neck, and ears from direct exposure. Select a hat made from a tightly woven material that does not allow sunlight to penetrate. (c) UV-protective sunglasses: Invest in UV-protective sunglasses that shield your eyes and the delicate skin surrounding them from UVA and UVB rays. Look for sunglasses that block 99-100% of UV radiation and meet the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) UV protection standards. (d) UPF clothing: UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) clothing is designed to block a significant percentage of the sun's rays. Choose clothing with a UPF rating of 30 or higher, which will block at least 96% of UV radiation. 3. Additional Strategies: (a) Seek shade: Whenever possible, seek shade under trees, umbrellas, or other structures providing a safe refuge from direct sunlight. (b) Avoid peak hours: Limit your sun exposure during peak hours (10 AM – 4 PM), as this is when UV radiation levels are at their highest. (c) Stay vigilant on cloudy days: Cloud cover does not provide complete protection from UV radiation, as about 80% of rays can penetrate through the clouds. Do not drop your guard and continue implementing the above precautions. Conclusion: Minimizing the risks of harmful UV exposure is critical for maintaining overall health, preventing skin damage and reducing the likelihood of skin cancer development. By conscientiously wearing sunscreen, protective clothing, and practicing additional preventive measures, it is possible to enjoy outdoor activities while safeguarding your skin and overall health from the harmful effects of UV radiation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The post seems to express some form of negativity or derision directed towards a person or group, but it does not openly express hate or encourages violence. However, we are asked to classify the post into two cases: personal or non-personal. \\"Personal\\" usually refers to insults or derogatory remarks made directly against an individual. \\"Non-personal\\" would involve derogatory comments made towards a group or community. The classification of the post largely depends on whether 'Jaraj' is being used to describe a characteristic inherent to a single person or a wider group. If 'Jaraj' refers to a specific person, this is a personal attack, but if 'Jaraj' referrers to a group or community of people, then it's a non-personal attack.

Today, with respect to the increasing growth of demand to get credit from the customers of banks and finance and credit institutions, using an effective and efficient method to decrease the risk of non-repayment of credit given is very necessary. Assessment of customers' credit is one of the most important and the most essential duties of banks and institutions, and if an error occurs in this field, it would leads to the great losses for banks and institutions. Thus, using the predicting computer systems has been significantly progressed in recent decades. The data that are provided to the credit institutions' managers help them to make a straight decision for giving the credit or not-giving it. In this paper, we will assess the customer credit through a combined classification using artificial neural networks, genetics algorithm and Bayesian probabilities simultaneously, and the results obtained from three methods mentioned above would be used to achieve an appropriate and final result. We use the K_folds cross validation test in order to assess the method and finally, we compare the proposed method with the methods such as Clustering-Launched Classification (CLC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) as well as GA+SVM where the genetics algorithm has been used to improve them.

Here are possible answers to this question: - brightness - sunny delight - direct sunlight - bright light - tanning I believe the correct choice is \\"direct sunlight\\", here's why:","completion":"The plant that suffered in the shade likely needed more sunlight than it was receiving. This means the correct place to plant it would be in direct sunlight. The term 'direct sunlight' refers to areas that receive full, unobstructed sunlight for at least 6 hours a day. This condition is ideal for many types of plants that require a lot of sunlight to perform photosynthesis effectively. Depending on the type of plant, it's possible that it could have also thrived under 'bright light.' Typically, a spot with bright light is near a south- or southwest-facing window that receives direct sunlight for a part of the day but is not in the sun's path the entire day. The terms 'brightness,' 'sunny delight,' and 'tanning' are not standard gardening terms used to describe the sun conditions needed for plants. Therefore, they are not suitable answers for this question, making 'direct sunlight' the ideal choice. Keep in mind, though, that different plants have different sunlight and shade requirements. Some may thrive in partial shade or indirect light, while others need a few hours of direct sunlight each day. Always research the individual needs of each plant to ensure it's placed in an ideal location. In conclusion, \\"direct sunlight\\" is the correct term because it refers to the specific condition in gardening where a plant receives unobstructed sunlight for a significant part of the day, which is ultimately what the shaded plant in your question is lacking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 is regarded as a turning point in medieval history, marking a return of the Western Roman Empire, since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the western emperors. It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state. There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into.

In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean “principal,” “eminent,” or \\"superior.\\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \\"title\\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals.

It had outstanding acting on the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role. It had marvelous photography, music and the noirest noir script ever. All of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get! This sequel is the exact opposite, it cannot possibly get worse, bad acting and a lame script, combined with totally inept direction, this is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re-enacted copy of the original. These copies are so bad they make you laugh and I laughed a lot in spite of myself, because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument. The only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the excerpts of the Jerry Goldsmith score of BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and the half-wit responsible for the script even included the \\"There is no smoking in this room\\" dialog in the interrogation scene and yes she sends her attorney (who is now a solicitor) away! I am sorry I have seen this awful film that should have never been made! It does damage to the original, so bad is it. The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I am sure Ms Stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy) can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original.

Article: Women consistently lie on social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter to make their lives appear more exciting, a survey has found. The survey was asked to carried out by Pencourage, a new anonymous \\"diary-style\\" social media website. Researchers found that at least one in four women exaggerated or twisted what they are doing on social media once a month. The survey of 2000 women found they mostly pretended to be out on the town, when in fact they are home alone, and beautify about an exotic holiday or their job. The most common reasons for women to write _ included worrying their lives would seem \\" boring\\", jealousy at seeing other people's more exciting posts and wanting to impress their friends and acquaintances. Psychologists suggested that as people attempt to stay connected on social media, they can in fact be left more isolated. They also said that the more we try to make our lives seem perfect, the less perfect we feel. According to the OnePoll survey, one third of women surveyed admitted to dishonesty on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter at some stage. Almost one in four admitted to lying or exaggerating about key aspects of their life online between one and three times a month while almost one in 10 said they lied more than once a week. Nearly 30 percent of women lied about \\"doing something when I am home alone\\", almost a quarter overstated their alcohol consumption while one in five were not truthful about their holiday activities or their jobs. Almost one in five women even lied about their \\"relationship status\\". \\"We work very hard presenting ourselves to the world online, pretending and attempting to be happy all the time which is exhausting and ultimately unfulfilling,\\" said Dr Michael Sinclair, a leading British consultant psychologist. \\"Leaving out the less desirable imperfections of our lives from the conversations with our 'friends online leads to less opportunity to feel empathized with, resulting in a greater sense of disconnection from others. \\" Question: According to the passage, women tend to lie on social networking sites because _ .

He's grown up hearing stories of the gallant Musketeers of the Guard - an elite military unit under the King's command - and dreams of joining their ranks and protecting the king and queen from threats, known and unknown. D'Artagnan hails from a lineage of skilled soldiers, and his father, a former Musketeer, instills in him the values of honor, courage, and allegiance. Trained in the art of combat and filled to the brim with patriotic fervor, he decides to leave his home and heads to the bustling streets of Paris, intending to join this esteemed brotherhood. On arriving in Paris, D'Artagnan soon realizes that the tales he grew up hearing were not entirely accurate. The bustling capital of France is rife with political intrigue, treachery, and deceit. The Musketeers, once the pinnacle of loyalty and valor, are now clouded by uncertainty, with their allegiance swaying between the reckless King Louis XIII and the manipulative Cardinal Richelieu. Thrust into this world of plots and counterplots, D'Artagnan's idealistic perception of a Musketeer is greatly challenged. However, instead of being disheartened, he becomes determined to restore the glory of the Musketeers. Forming an unlikely alliance with the three most formidable Musketeers – Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, D’Artagnan uncovers a plot threatening the monarchy's stability.

Article: He has lived through various dangers but time may be running out for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. On September 11, Israel announced its decision to remove him, following several Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israel. \\"He should be punished for the killings,\\" an Israeli official said, \\"He has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups.\\" But the decision has angered many other countries. China said that Arafat is the true leader, elected by the Palestinian people, and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East. Other governments share this idea. Arafat himself said: \\"They can kill me, but never get me out of my country.\\" He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel. But, just like a cat with nine lives, Arafat escaped every time. For years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night, thinking a moving person is harder to hit. In 1985, Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat. The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt. In 1992, the aircraft in which he was flying over North Africa broke in two during a crash landing. The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive. What is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger. Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ram Allah in December 2001. When they saw the attackers coming, Arafat's bodyguards _ his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground. Seconds later, several bombs were dropped nearby. Though safe, his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat. But, Arafat, with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away, showed no fear at all. He stayed in the damaged office, talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel. All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others. But has he used up the last of his nine lives? Only time will tell. Question: What did the author mean by saying \\"just like a cat has nine lives\\" when he talked about Arafat? - Arafat is as clever as a cat. - Arafat can live as long as a cat. - Arafat can stay alive after accidents or disasters as if he has nine lives. - Arafat should have died for at least 8 times.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: TOKYO--Lonely astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) may soon be getting a robot friend from Japan. Japan's space agency is considering putting a talking humanoid robot on the ISS to watch the work while astronauts are asleep, monitor their health and stress levels and communicate to Earth through the microblogging site Twitter. Japan's space agency JAXA announced this week that it is looking at a plan to send a humanoid robot to the space station in 2013 that could communicate with the ground through Twitter--primarily feeding photos, rather than original ideas --and provide astronauts with \\"comfort and companionship\\". Following up on US NASA's \\"Robonaut\\" R2 program, which is set for launch on the Discovery shuttle next week, the Japanese robot would be part of a larger effort to create and refine robots that can be used by the elderly, JAXA said in a statement. Japan is one of the leading countries in robotics and has a rapidly aging society with one of the world's longest life expectancies. Improving robot communication capabilities could help elderly people on Earth by providing a nonintrusive means of monitoring the robot owner's health and vital signs and sending information to emergency responders if there is an abnormality, JAXA said. \\"We are thinking in terms of a very humanlike robot that would have facial expressions and be able to talk with the astronauts,\\" said JAXA's Satoshi Sano. The robot was being developed with the advertising and communications giant Dentsu Inc and a team at Tokyo University. The NASA project has a humanlike head, hands and arms and uses the same tools as station crew members. The \\"Robonaut\\" called R2 is intended to carry out maintenance tasks in the station's Destiny lab. NASA says it hopes that humanoid robots could one day stand in for astronauts during spacewalks or perform tasks too difficult or dangerous for humans. For now, the 2.5 million NASA robot is limited to activities within the lab. Question: According to the passage, a humanoid robot, put on the ISS, shall carry out the tasks except _ . - keep in contact with Earth - get a friend for astronauts from Japan - take care of the ISS sometimes - keep an eye on the health of the astronauts Answer:","completion":"get a friend for astronauts from Japan"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have the equation: 44*b - 5*b = 8*b - 42*b + 4088 First, let's simplify the equation by combining the \\"b\\" terms on both sides: On the left side, we have 44*b - 5*b. When we subtract 5*b from 44*b, we get 39*b. On the right side, we have 8*b - 42*b. When we subtract 42*b from 8*b, we get -34*b. Now our equation looks like this: 39*b = -34*b + 4088 Next, let's move all the \\"b\\" terms to one side by adding 34*b to both sides: 39*b + 34*b = 4088 When we add 39*b and 34*b, we get 73*b. Our equation now looks like this: 73*b = 4088 Now, we just need to solve for \\"b\\". To do this, we need to divide both sides by 73: b = 4088 / 73 When we do the division, we find out that b = 56.

But that has yet to be implemented because a power-sharing Stormont executive does not exist to pass it. Victims have called on the parties to quickly agree a compensation process. Campaigner Margaret McGuckin said survivors of abuse are in desperate need of compensation, with many now in poor health. \\"So many of our people are mentally ill; emotionally ill; in care homes; on their death beds,\\" she said. \\"Now they're saying: 'Just give us the money to bury ourselves.'\\" Sir Anthony Hart, the retired judge who led the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, has written to political parties to urge a \\"speedy implementation\\" of his proposals. On Thursday, Sinn Féin's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill set out her plan for setting up a compensation fund. It included a proposal that the parties agree to commit an initial amount of funding from the Northern Ireland budget and seek a \\"significant contribution\\" from the government and religious institutions.

According to the given information, the Eufaula Connection did, in fact, return his call half an hour later. The prompt does not mention anything about him waiting all day for the call to be returned. In this scenario, it appears that the individual was able to connect with the Eufaula Connection within a reasonably short amount of time (half an hour). As a result, waiting all day for a call that was never returned is not an accurate description of the events that took place. However, it is essential to remember that without more context, we can't make assumptions about other aspects of their communication. For example, we don't know if the Eufaula Connection provided any helpful information or if they made any agreements during their conversation. Also, we don't know if the individual had any other interactions with the Eufaula Connection later in the day. In conclusion, based on the provided details, the correct answer is c). no, as the Eufaula Connection did return the call half an hour later, and thus the statement \\"He waited all day, and his Eufaula Connection never returned his call\\" is not accurate in this case."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This person is called a \\"crime commissioner.\\" Just like how you might help pick up toys after playing, this person helps make sure the police do a good job. But something might be wrong. There's a team that watches over the police, just like how parents watch their children. They are called the \\"police watchdog,\\" and they check if everything is fair and right. The police watchdog heard that the newly-elected crime commissioner might have made a mistake with the money they spent during the election. Money is important in elections because people need to let others know about their ideas and plans. They use money to make signs, travel, and spread the word in newspapers, TV, and even the internet. Just like how we save money to buy something special, it's important to know how much money was spent during an election. The police watchdog wants to know if the new crime commissioner was honest about their election expenses. They check if the numbers match the actual money spent, like when you count how many coins you have in your piggy bank. Being honest is important because it helps people trust the person they chose to protect them from crime. So now, the police watchdog will investigate - or look very, very closely - at the claims people are making about the crime commissioner's money mistakes.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many more percentage points of people claim to be Protestant than Muslim?","completion":"Title: Analyzing the Difference in Percentage Points Between Protestant and Muslim Populations Introduction: Religion has been a core component of human culture and society since the beginnings of recorded history. Two of the major world religions, Protestantism and Islam, have significantly impacted various aspects of society, including politics, economics, and social life. To gain a better understanding of the religious landscape and the distribution of these faiths across the globe, it is crucial to explore and examine the percentages of people who claim to be adherents of these religious beliefs. In this article, we will delve into the differences in percentage points between those who claim to be Protestant and those who claim to be Muslim worldwide. Global Distribution of Religions: According to the Pew Research Center, as of 2020, there are approximately 2.3 billion Christians, 1.9 billion Muslims, 1.2 billion people unaffiliated with any religion, and 1.1 billion Hindus making up the majority of the world's 7.8 billion people. Christianity is the largest religion, with Islam closely following behind as the second-largest religion in the world. Among Christians, there are varying denominations, with Protestantism being one of the most significant branches. Protestantism as a Branch of Christianity: Protestantism emerged during the 16th century as part of the Reformation movement led by Martin Luther and John Calvin. It is a diverse branch of Christianity that encompasses numerous denominations such as Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, and Pentecostal, among others. Estimates suggest that there are about 800 million to 1 billion Protestants worldwide, accounting for roughly 11% to 13% of the global population. Islam as a Major World Religion: Islam was founded in the 7th century by the Prophet Muhammad in what is currently Saudi Arabia. As a religion, Islam emphasizes the belief in one God, Allah, and teaches that Muhammad is his final prophet. Muslims adhere to the teachings of the Quran, their holy book, and observe the Five Pillars of Islam as central tenets of their faith. Islam has two major branches – Sunni and Shia, with Sunni Muslims making up the majority (about 85-90%) of the Muslim population. The overall number of Muslims accounts for nearly 24% to 25% of the global population. Comparing the Number of Protestants and Muslims Worldwide: To determine the difference in percentage points between people claiming to be Protestant and those claiming to be Muslim, we must compare the percentages of each religious population as part of the global population. As previously mentioned, Protestants account for approximately 11% to 13%, while Muslims make up around 24% to 25% of the global population. Calculating the Difference in Percentage Points: Using the estimated percentage points for both religious populations (13% for Protestants and 25% for Muslims), we can calculate the difference in percentage points as follows: Difference = Percentage of Muslims - Percentage of Protestants Difference = 25% - 13% Difference = 12% Conclusion: Based on our analysis, approximately 12 percentage points more people claim to be Muslim than Protestant worldwide. This number indicates the presence of a more significant Muslim population globally and highlights the importance of understanding diverse religious beliefs and practices across various societies. It should be noted, however, that religious demographics can change over time due to various factors like fertility rates, migration, and religious conversions. Therefore, regularly updated data can provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the demographics and distribution of religious populations around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paradise Towers is the main setting of the 1987 Doctor Who television serial \\"Paradise Towers,\\" which is part of the show's 24th season. It is a story featuring the Seventh Doctor, portrayed by Sylvester McCoy, and his companion Mel, played by Bonnie Langford. The towers were supposed to be a luxurious, self-contained living space that would provide all the necessary amenities and recreational facilities for its residents, but they fell into disrepair and became a dystopian environment. Kroagnon was an architect who designed various impressive structures, including Paradise Towers, known for his extraordinary yet deadly creations. Each of these buildings had a fatal flaw that led to the deaths and suffering of their inhabitants. Consequently, the inhabitants of the towers rebelled against his designs and imprisoned him inside a sealed tank in the basement of Paradise Towers. Kroagnon's disembodied intelligence remained hidden there for centuries. The story unfolds when the Doctor and Mel arrive at the towers and discover the chaos within. The inhabitants have formed different gangs, including the cannibalistic Rezzies, anarchic Kangs, and authoritarian Caretakers. The Doctor and Mel work to restore peace within the towers and defeat Kroagnon, who attempts to regain control of his creation by transferring his mind into the body of the Chief Caretaker, played by Richard Briers. Ultimately, the Doctor and Mel, along with newfound friends Pex and companions from the various gangs, manage to foil Kroagnon's plans and restore some semblance of order to Paradise Towers. This particular villain highlights the dangers of unchecked ambition, as well as a disregard for the welfare of others in the pursuit of architectural excellence.

Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"believe the threat\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"Under the circumstances presented, the question \\"What will others want to do next?\\" requires a thorough analysis of the context, the people involved, and possible motivations behind their actions. The answer \\"believe the threat\\" can be seen as a valid response, but it does not provide an in-depth perspective on the situation. Upon hearing that Tracy resigned from their position because of a threat to reveal a scandal, we must consider several factors and perspectives to understand what the people (\\"others\\") involved may want to do next. 1. The Person Threatening Tracy: The individual who threatened Tracy could potentially carry out their threat by revealing the scandal. Their motivations may include revenge, jealousy, or personal gain. On the other hand, this person may choose not to disclose the scandal, given that Tracy has complied with their demands. 2. Tracy's Colleagues: Tracy's coworkers may react to this news in various ways. Some may believe the threat, while others may question its validity or even offer support to Tracy. They may also want to conduct their own investigation into the perceived scandal, determine if and how it affects their work, or distance themselves from the situation. 3. Tracy's Friends and Family: People close to Tracy could be concerned about their well-being and may seek to offer emotional support or practical assistance. They may also wish to help Tracy fight the accusations if they believe they are unfounded or to encourage Tracy to come clean about the scandal if they believe there is truth to it. 4. Tracy's Superiors and the Organization: Depending on whether the organization believes the threat, they may undertake an internal investigation, consult with legal or human resources departments, or even reach out to Tracy for clarification. They may seek to preserve the organization's image by distancing themselves from Tracy or by attempting to minimize the impact of the scandal. 5. The Public: If the information about the threat becomes public knowledge, there may be various responses from the general public. Some may believe the threat, while others may not. They may become more curious about the scandal, request further information from both Tracy and the organization, and potentially take sides. In conclusion, \\"believe the threat\\" can be a valid answer to \\"What will others want to do next?\\" However, it only represents one facet of a complex situation encompassing the perspectives of several parties. It is essential to analyze all the stakeholders' potential actions and motivations to provide a more comprehensive understanding of what others may want to do following Tracy's resignation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vitaliy Naida, Ukraine's security chief, told BBC World News he was \\"absolutely positive\\" the men were officers from the GRU, the foreign military intelligence branch of Russia's army. \\"We have battle dress uniform, we have automatic rifles that are produced only in the Russian Federation only for Special Forces' use,\\" he said. Mr Naida said the men were part of a group of 220 GRU officers deployed to Luhansk on 2 May. The others have now returned to Russia, he said. \\"We have already started a criminal case for a terrorist act,\\" Mr Naida said. In a video, one of the captured men said he was a sergeant from the central Russian city of Togliatti, where an elite intelligence unit for the Russian army is based. The video has not been independently verified. Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for Russia's ministry of defence, said the two men were not serving soldiers at the time they were detained. Mr Konashenkov said the two men had been mistreated by Ukrainian special forces who had \\"beat convenient testimony out of them\\". \\"We are counting on the Ukrainian leadership to show good sense,\\" he said, adding that he hoped the two men would be \\"released as soon as possible\\". The Ukrainian government, Western leaders and Nato say there is clear evidence that Russia is helping the rebels with heavy weapons and soldiers. Independent experts echo that accusation. Moscow denies the claims, but says that a number of Russian nationals are fighting with the separatists in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions as volunteers. Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine's foreign minister, told reporters that Russian officers had tried to kill the two men as soon as they were detained. Mr Klimkin declined to give more details.

Me and Orson Welles is a 2008 British-American period drama film directed by Richard Linklater and starring Zac Efron, Christian McKay, and Claire Danes. Based on Robert Kaplow's novel of the same name, the story, set in 1937 New York, tells of a teenager hired to perform in Orson Welles's groundbreaking stage adaptation of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. He becomes attracted to a career-driven production assistant. The film was shot in London and New York and on the Isle of Man in February, March and April 2008, and was released in the United States on November 25, 2009, and the United Kingdom on December 4, 2009. Holly Gent Palmo and Vincent Palmo Jr. adapted the film's screenplay from Robert Kaplow's novel of the same name about a teenager (in reality, the 15-year-old Arthur Anderson, who played Lucius in Welles' production) involved in the founding of Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre. After receiving funding from CinemaNX, a production company backed by the Isle of Man film fund, and an offer from Framestore Features to co-finance the film, Richard Linklater came on board to direct Me and Orson Welles. Zac Efron signed on as the lead in early January 2008, claiming he decided to take the role of Richard Samuels because \\"It's a completely different project than I've ever done before,\\" while Claire Danes joined the cast as the protagonist's love interest Sonja Jones in late January. In the theatre, Christian McKay had portrayed Orson Welles in the one-man play Rosebud: The Lives of Orson Welles at a number of venues, including the Edinburgh Festival and King's Head (London). He reprised the role in the U.S. at the 2007 \\"Brits Off Broadway\\" festival, where Linklater saw his performance and then cast McKay as Welles, retaining him over the subsequent objections of the project's producer. Me and Orson Welles underwent filming in the Isle of Man, Pinewood Studios, London and New York from February to April 2008. Filming in London commenced first in mid-February, before scenes in the Isle of Man were shot February 24-March 14, 2008, where filming locations included Gaiety Theatre and various other parts of Douglas. During filming in Douglas, Efron and Danes believe they sighted a ghost, or \\"supernatural\\" being, outside a window on set at Gaiety Theatre. Filming in Britain resumed in late March for six weeks at Pinewood Studios. Other locations included Crystal Palace Park, where a facade of New York's Mercury Theatre was set up for a scene. Actor James Tupper claimed that the best replica of an old New York theater was in England, while many of the actors who filled the company were from the Royal Shakespeare Company. The production crew only briefly visited New York; photographs were taken and footage shot to be added into the film as digital effects. Every exterior shot was filmed on a single street built at Pinewood Studios with a green screen at one end; different angles and slightly altered set designs were used between shots to make the street appear different each time.

What is the name of the person whose popularity declined markedly in the US after her marriage? Answer the above question based on the context below: Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970, (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974.","completion":"The name of the person whose popularity declined markedly in the US after her marriage is Makeba.

Nairn could have advised us here if there had been any striking developments since we left the last place.\\" \\"I wasn't expecting to hear from him,\\" Vane replied tersely. Carroll read keen disappointment in his face, and was not surprised, although the absence of any message meant that it was safe for them to go on with their project and that should have afforded his companion satisfaction.

Movie title: Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Context: Nine-year-old Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), who suffers from Asperger syndrome, is the son of German American Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks).[5] Thomas would often send Oskar on missions to do something involving one of his riddles. The last riddle he ever gives Oskar is proof that New York City once possessed a Sixth Borough. In a flashback, Thomas and Oskar play a scavenger hunt to find objects throughout New York City. The game requires communication with other people and is not easy for the socially awkward Oskar who is told \\"If things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding\\". On September 11, 2001, Oskar and his classmates are sent home from school early while his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) is at work. When Oskar gets home, he finds five messages from his father on the answering machine saying he is in the World Trade Center. When Thomas calls for the sixth time, although Oskar is present to answer this call, he is too scared to answer. The machine records a sixth message which stops when the building collapses. Oskar knows his father has been killed and falls to the floor. He replaces the answering machine with a new one and hides the old one so his mother will never find out. A few weeks after what Oskar calls \\"the worst day,\\" he confides in his German grandmother and they become closer. Oskar's relationship with his mother worsens since she cannot explain why the World Trade Center was attacked and why his father died. Oskar tells his mother he wishes it had been her in the building, not his father, and she responds, \\"So do I\\". After, Oskar says he did not mean it, but his mother doesn't believe him. A year later, Oskar finds a vase in his father's closet with a key in an envelope with the word \\"Black\\" on it. He vows to find what the key fits.

Here is an article: Police officers stopped people on New York City’s streets more than 200,000 times during the first three months of 2012, putting the Bloomberg administration on course to shatter a record set last year for the highest annual tally of street stops. Data on the 203,500 street stops from January through March — up from 183,326 during the same quarter a year earlier — was sent to the City Council from 1 Police Plaza late on Friday under a legal requirement spawned by public outrage over the 1999 fatal police shooting in the Bronx of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black street peddler. On Saturday, the department disclosed the information to reporters and credited the controversial topic known as “Stop, Question, Frisk” as one of several policies of engagement whose effectiveness was vindicated by a decline in homicides in New York. So far this year, 129 people have been murdered in New York through Friday, the 132nd day of the year, a number that put the city on track for a new low in annual homicides. The 471 murders logged by the Police Department in 2009 was the lowest annual tally for any previous 12-month period since reliable numbers were kept in the early 1960s. Still, the new street-stop numbers got a fresh round of criticism after a week that saw civil libertarians and prospective mayoral candidates debating the crime-suppression value of such stops and blaming the tactics for tearing at the fabric of city life, particularly in minority neighborhoods, during a period of historically low violence. On Wednesday, the New York Civil Liberties Union issued a study of last year’s stop data, arguing that far too many innocent people were suffering under the policy. The study said that while young black and Hispanic men made up 4.7 percent of the city’s population, those between the ages of 14 and 24 accounted for 41.6 percent of stops in 2011. On Saturday, the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said the “dramatic increase” in stops underscored her calls for reform. “While the N.Y.P.D. should continue to have the ability to stop and frisk people where there is a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, I remain convinced that with better monitoring, supervision and accountability we can avoid the corrosive impact of a poorly targeted program,” Ms. Quinn said in a statement. “We cannot continue to stop, question and frisk nearly 700,000 New Yorkers in this way without doing harm to the relationship between police officers and the people they are protecting, particularly in communities of color.” And the city’s public advocate, Bill de Blasio, said that while the rise in stops seemed a product of a numbers-driven police culture, he proposed more routine use of the department’s own auditing of those statistics to track the outcomes for each stop-and-frisk episode, like whether someone is then arrested. “The record number of unwarranted stops is widening the rift between police and the communities whose cooperation we need to fight crime,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement. “Make no mistake — this is the result of City Hall aggressively pushing precinct commanders to use stop and frisk beyond what is necessary and effective. It’s time to bring these numbers back to earth.” Both Ms. Quinn and Mr. de Blasio are expected to run for mayor. Peppered with questions at a news conference on Friday, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said that critics of the street-stop tactics “never have an answer” about how to tackle the disproportionate levels of crime in certain city neighborhoods. The department, by contrast, is always looking for answers to “slow down” crime. “I would submit that our strategies are saving lives,” Mr. Kelly said. He added: “You look at the numbers in this city; you look at the lives that we’re saving, and I would submit to you that the majority of those lives are minorities, and most of them are young men who are being killed for senseless reasons. We are saving those lives, and, quite frankly, we’re saving them at a much greater degree and extent than other cities are.” Last year, there were 685,724 stop-and-frisk encounters, the highest total in the 10 years the department has reported the data. The annual total has gradually increased, from a low of 97,296 in 2002, according to departmental statistics.

Since 1971, which US Federal holiday has held been on the second Monday in October?","completion":"Since 1971, the United States federal holiday celebrated on the second Monday of October each year is Columbus Day. This holiday commemorates the arrival of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus to the Americas on October 12, 1492. It is a nationally recognized holiday, and various establishments such as schools, banks, and government offices are typically closed on this day. Columbus Day was initially celebrated on October 12, but it was later moved to the second Monday in October after the passage of the Uniform Monday Holiday Act in 1968. This federal law aimed to provide more three-day weekends for the American workforce by shifting the celebration of specific holidays to Mondays. The act took effect in 1971, and since then, Columbus Day has been celebrated on the second Monday of October. While Columbus Day is observed throughout the United States, the significance and celebration of the day have evolved over the years. Various states and cities have officially replaced Columbus Day with alternative holidays such as Indigenous Peoples' Day or Native American Day, which honor the contributions and history of the Native American populations who were impacted by the arrival of European explorers and settlers. These changes reflect the growing awareness of and sensitivity toward the controversial nature of Columbus's legacy and the adverse effects of European colonization on indigenous cultures in the Americas."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, .

With each stroke, he nurses the grass to reveal its lush green undertones, previously hidden beneath the autumnal palette. He maneuvers the blower with the grace of an artist and the precision of a surgeon, ensuring that each area of his yard is carefully and meticulously attended to. The man, now fully absorbed in his task, becomes one with the blower, maintaining a rhythm that showcases his experience and dedication to the art of landscaping. As the sun climbs higher, casting brilliant lights and shadows throughout the yard, the man pauses momentarily to assess his progress. The once disorganized heap of leaves has now transformed into an impressively arranged mosaic that flutters and rustles in the soft breeze. Alongside the peaceful melody of the wind blowing through the trees, one could almost hear the leaves whisper their appreciation to the artist who so skillfully orchestrated their final performance. Feeling satisfied, the man proceeds to his next task - the gathering and disposal of the vibrant foliage. With a rake and tarp now in hand, he gently ushers the leaves onto the tarp, taking care not to disturb the intricate arrangement that has formed. As he completes this task, the man takes a moment to reflect upon the transient beauty of the season, understanding that change is a necessary and intrinsic part of life's continuous cycle. Finally, as the man wraps up his work, he pats the push leaf blower affectionately, grateful for its unwavering assistance in this yearly ritual. Pausing to survey his artfully manicured yard one last time, the man catches a glimpse of a lone, golden leaf soaring through the air on an unseen breeze. A faint smile graces his lips – an acknowledgement of the forces beyond his control, working in tandem with his own efforts to create the beautiful, fleeting tapestry that will soon fade, only to be reborn anew with the passage of time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Pick from: A. no. B. yes.","completion":"A. no. While both questions involve communication through messaging platforms, they are different in terms of the platforms they are referring to and the core concern of the question. The first question pertains to Google and the storing and access of custom status messages on Google Talk (GTalk). On the other hand, the second question addresses the visibility of messages sent through Facebook and iMessage for non-friends. To elaborate further on both questions: 1. Google Talk, popularly known as GTalk, was an instant messaging service provided by Google. It was discontinued and replaced by Google Hangouts in 2013. Google Talk did allow users to set custom status messages, but it is ambiguous as to whether Google stored these messages and could be accessed even after being cleared locally. Since Google's privacy policy indicates that they may store certain data, it's possible that custom status messages could have been stored, but accessing those messages after clearing them locally might not be feasible. It would likely depend on your email service provider's data storage and retention policies. 2. Facebook and iMessage are two different messaging platforms developed by two different companies – Facebook and Apple, respectively. Sending a message to a person through Facebook and iMessage requires using their respective apps and services. If you send a message to someone using Facebook Messenger and you are not friends, the message will go to their Other/Message Request folder, and your recipient may or may not see it depending on their settings or if they check that folder. However, the recipient's ability to read that message has no connection with iMessage, as it operates on a completely separate platform. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same. They address two distinct concerns and involve separate messaging platforms and issues (Google and the storage of custom statuses on GTalk vs. Facebook and the readability of messages sent through Facebook and iMessage to non-friends)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

Options: a ) 2.0 , b ) 2.8 , c ) 2.2 , d ) 2.5 , e ) 3.0 A:","completion":"To solve this problem, we will first set up an equation based on the given information and then solve for the original price per kg. Note that the original quantity of salt is not given, but we can use a variable to represent this value. Let x denote the original price per kg of the salt and y denote the original quantity of salt (in kgs) purchased by the lady for Rs. 400. The equation can be set up as follows: Original cost = Reduced cost x * y = (0.9 * x) * (y + 20) Here, 0.9 * x is the reduced price per kg (90% of the original price), and y + 20 is the increased quantity of salt purchased due to the 10 % reduction in price. Now, let's simplify the equation: x * y = (0.9 * x) * (y + 20) x * y = 0.9 * x * y + 0.9 * x * 20 x * y - 0.9 * x * y = 0.9 * x * 20 (1 - 0.9) * x * y = 0.9 * x * 20 0.1 * x * y = 18 * x As long as x is not zero, we can divide both sides by 0.1 * x: y = 18 * 10 y = 180 Now, to find the original price per kg (x), we use the original cost equation: x * y = 400 x * 180 = 400 x = 400 / 180 x = 20 / 9 x = 2.222 (rounded to 3 decimal places) From the given options, the closest value for x is 2.2, which corresponds to option c.

This indicates that The Phoenix may not be meeting the expectations of its clientele in certain areas. The low rating could be attributed to various factors, such as the quality of food, service, ambiance, or value for money.

Question: \\"How did religion affect the ruler of the country?\\" Context: \\"Towards the end of the Republic, religious and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative. Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of pontifex maximus; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the pax deorum, maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Religion significantly affected the ruler of the country, particularly towards the end of the Roman Republic, as it became more closely intertwined with political offices. This connection can be seen through the role of the pontifex maximus, which became largely associated with the highest political figures, like consuls. Augustus, the first Roman emperor, was vested with a vast range of political, military, and priestly powers. He acquired numerous major priesthoods in Rome, including that of pontifex maximus, which allowed him to showcase these roles as traditional honors. His religious power and influence were utilized to implement several reforms, which he presented as adaptive, restorative, and regulatory rather than innovative. Some notable examples of these reforms include the elevation of the ancient Arvales, the promotion of plebeian Compitalia, and the patronage of the Vestal Virgins as a means of restoring Roman morality. Augustus's religious authority enabled him to establish and maintain the pax deorum, or the peace of the gods, throughout his reign. He also took the responsibility of adopting a successor to ensure the continuation of this religious and social stability. In conclusion, religion played a substantial role in influencing and shaping the rule of the Roman Empire, particularly in the context of the ruler's duties and responsibilities. This influence can be seen through the religious reforms and practices implemented by Augustus, which not only solidified his power but also demonstrated the importance of religion in maintaining social order and stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You need to add your softened room temperature butter to a large bowl, and add your powdered sugar. Then, you want to use a hand mixer or stand mixer to cream the two ingredients together....I think the answer is","completion":"1. You need to add your softened room temperature butter to a large bowl, and add your sugar. Then, you want to use a hand mixer or stand mixer to cream the two ingredients together. The correct method for creaming butter and sugar when making chocolate bread is the first option. This is because the process involves beating together softened room temperature butter with granulated sugar (not powdered sugar) until the mixture becomes light, fluffy, and pale in color. This method helps to create a smooth consistency and incorporates air into the batter, resulting in a lighter texture for the finished bread. Option 2 is incorrect because it suggests using powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar. Powdered sugar, also known as confectioner's sugar or icing sugar, has a finer texture and is not typically used for creaming in baking recipes. It is more commonly used for icing, glazes, and other confectionery purposes. Using powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar in a creaming method may result in a denser, less airy texture in the final product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Scroll down for video. The group has largely focused on Iraq and is currently fighting for control of Kobane in Syria but there are fears they are spreading into North Africa. The head of US Africa Command told reporters at the Pentagon: 'They put training camps out there', referring to ISIS who have seized territory in Iraq and neighboring Syria this year in a brutal and swift offensive of beheadings and forced religious conversions. 'ISIS has begun its efforts over in the east out there to introduce some people over there. 'But we'll have to just continue to monitor and watch that carefully in the future to see what happens or whether it grows on unabated.' He described the IS activity in eastern Libya as 'very small' but added that there were 'around a couple hundred' militants present at the camps, with US forces continuing to track the area. The United States has been waging an air war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but when asked if the training camps in Libya were a potential target for American forces, Mr Rodriguez replied: 'No, not right now.' The four-star general said it appeared the ISIS militants in Libya were not volunteers coming from outside the country but militia members who had shifted their loyalty to the jihadist group. His comments came after the US government and European allies voiced 'grave concern' over mounting violence and civil unrest in Libya. ISIS has already seized huge swathes of land in Iraq and Syria, including the town of Raqqa, pictured. Experts have warned that ISIS has gained a foothold in the eastern town of Derna, exploiting the chaos that has engulfed the North African state. Libya has been plagued by instability since the overthrow of autocratic leader Moamer Kadhafi in 2011, and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi recently boasted of vows of allegiance from militants in the country.

ISIS, which aims to establish an Islamic caliphate across the region, is the prime target of the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria. The group has attracted a wave of global revulsion after a series of horrific executions of Western hostages filmed and released online, as well as gruesome videos depicting the beheadings of Syrian and Iraqi forces.

By Larisa Brown, Defence Reporter for The Daily Mail. More British troops will be sent to help the Iraqi security forces as part of a large-scale mission to defeat Islamic State jihadists. Military trainers will teach the Iraqi army how to counter deadly roadside bombs as the British Army steps up its role in the country, leading to claims of ‘mission creep’. They will join four large American training bases that will be established within weeks to train and advise the Iraqi army on a wider scale. Details are yet to be finalised but an announcement is expected in the coming days. Lieutenant General Gordon Messenger told the Defence Select Committee yesterday: ‘The training and support that we are providing has been requested by both the Kurds and central Iraqi Government. 'The Americans will see the establishment of four big training bases - one of which will be in Erbil. 'As part of that we see ourselves delivering niche specialist training in the area which is much needed, particular in IEDs. 'We are still scoping the exact nature of that but we hope to have some concrete proposals in the coming days.' He added: 'We are sending the reconnaissance forces out there to ensure that at the time when are training is needed we will be able to deliver it.’ In terms of numbers, they were still looking at both ‘light’ and ‘heavy’ options, he said. Islamist jihadists have started laying IEDs to take out Iraqi forces as part of a change in tactics after UK airstrikes blasted their vehicles and killed their fighters. British soldiers – who have learnt how to detect the deadly bombs after fighting against the Taliban in Afghanistan – have been asked to help by the Iraqi government due to their specialist knowledge. The deputy chief of defence staff said British forces were also looking at other training possibilities as part of the UK’s contribution to a ‘large scale venture’ in training anti- Islamic State forces. He added: 'I think importantly it is demand led… we are delivering the type of training that these forces have asked for and need.’ Hundreds of British forces will also be sent to join American troops in training thousands of Syrian moderates outside the country. Defence sources said both Saudi Arabia and Jordan could host the training grounds but details are yet to be finalised. Peter Watkins, Director General of Security Policy, denied the further deployment of UK forces to ‘advise and train’ Iraqi security forces was ‘mission creep’. He told MPs: ‘Whatever we do has to be guided by the objectives we set out at the first place. 'I think if we remain guided by the objectives we can avoid mission creep.’ Lt Gen Messenger said air strikes had helped demoralise Islamic State –but had forced the extremist fighters to change tactics. He said: ‘The effect on the morale of both those organisations has been significantly enhanced by those air strikes.’ There had been an ‘equivalent reduction’ in the morale of IS, who were now using guerrilla tactics such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs). ‘They were much more out in the open and even held military parades in certain areas’ Lt Gen Messenger said. ‘That has stopped. They are resorting to more asymmetric tactics, including the use of IEDs. They are using quite extensive countermeasures to avoid them being struck, moving at night, using the weather, avoiding grouping in big areas.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"The Islamic State has set up terror training camps in Libya, as more than one hundred militants have gathered in the country.

As of 2013, it is part of Penguin Random House, which is jointly owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann and British global education and publishing company Pearson PLC. - A diminutive is a word which has been modified to convey a slighter degree of its root meaning, to convey the smallness of the object or quality named, or to convey a sense of intimacy or endearment. A (abbreviated ) is a word-formation device used to express such meanings; in many languages, such forms can be translated as \\"little\\" and diminutives can also be formed as multi-word constructions such as \\"Tiny Tim\\". Diminutives are used frequently when speaking to small children or when expressing extreme tenderness and intimacy to an adult. As such, they are often employed for nicknames and pet names. The opposite of the diminutive form is the augmentative. - The Penguin Group is a trade book publisher, part of Penguin Random House. It is owned by Pearson PLC, the global education and publishing company, and Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate. The new company was created by a merger that was finalized on 1 July 2013, with Bertelsmann owning 53% of the joint venture, and Pearson controlling the remaining 47%. - Pearson PLC is a British multinational publishing and education company headquartered in London. It was founded as a construction business in the 1840s. It shut down its construction activities in the 1920s and switched to publishing. It is the largest education company and the largest book publisher in the world. Pearson has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American Depository Receipts. History. Construction business: 1844 to the 1920s. The company was founded by Samuel Pearson in 1844 as a building and engineering concern operating in Yorkshire under the name \\"S. Pearson & Son\\". In 1880, control passed to his grandson Weetman Dickinson Pearson, an engineer, who in 1890 moved the business to London and turned it into one of the world's largest construction companies. Another of its prominent engineers was Ernest William Moir who, after working for Pearson on tunnels in New York City, became the contractor's agent on construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the River Thames in London between 1892 and 1897. The company also built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, the Halifax Dry Dock in Canada, the East River Railway Tunnels in New York City, the Mexican Grand Canal that drained Mexico City, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico, and railways and harbours around the world. In November 1915, the firm began construction of HM Factory, Gretna, the largest cordite factory in the UK during World War I. - A joint venture (JV) is a business entity created by two or more parties, generally characterized by shared ownership, shared returns and risks, and shared governance. Most joint ventures are incorporated, although some, as in the oil and gas industry, are \\"unincorporated\\" joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity. Key elements of a joint venture's design include: 1) the number of parties; 2) the geographic, product, technology and value-chain scope within which the JV will operate; 3) the contributions of the parties; 4) the structural form (each country has specific options, e.g. in the U.S. the main options are a C Corporation or an LLC/partnership structure); 5) the valuation of initial contributions and ownership split among the parties; 6) the economic arrangements, post-deal (e.g. Is the joint venture intended to general profits vs. operate as a cost-sharing or production-sharing venture; if a for-profit entity, will the parties share profits in proportion to equity ownership, or some other way?); 7) governance and control; 8) Talent/HR model (will the Jv have its own staff on own payroll vs. second staff from the parent companies; 9) contractual arrangements with the parent companies for inputs, outputs or services; 10) exit and evolution provisions? - Bertelsmann is a German multinational corporation based in Gütersloh, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

This contrasts deeply with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: \\"oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect\\"), or several (\\"rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected\\"), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are \\"-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed\\"). A complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes (\\"rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed\\"), or more than one root in a compound (\\"black-board, rat-race\\"). Words can be put together to build larger elements of language, such as phrases (\\"a red rock\\"), clauses (\\"I threw a rock\\"), and sentences (\\"He threw a rock too, but he missed\\"). - Hamish Hamilton Limited was a British book publishing house , founded in 1931 eponymously by the half - Scot half - American Jamie Hamilton ( Hamish is the vocative form of the Gaelic ' Seamus ' ( meaning James ) , James the English form -- which was also his given name , and Jamie the diminutive form ) .

Veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell was elected MP for Great Grimsby in 1977 but will step down at the next election. A veteran Labour MP has claimed the 'problem' with female politicians is that they care too much about issues which are relevant to ordinary people. Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP for Grimsby, said the increasing number of women in the Commons would be 'less inclined to discuss the big issues'. His remarks, on the BBC's Woman's Hour this morning, sparked fury and calls for the Labour leader Ed Miliband to make it clear he disagrees. It comes after Mr Mitchell this weekend claimed that the growing number of female MPs in the Labour party was making it too ‘gentle’ to wield power after the next election. Mr Mitchell, 79, said he was worried about the falling number of experienced men in the party because the party will be full of ‘amenable and leadable’ women obsessed with feminism. The Labour MP, who is stepping down at the next election, said Labour was becoming more ‘family-friendly, gentler’ but ‘less prepared for all-night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind’. Speaking today, Mr Mitchell attempted to explain his remarks. He said: 'I think the problem is simply this, that parliament with more women is going to be more anxious to discuss issues relevant to the people, that is to say family issues, social issues. 'And less inclined to discuss big issues like should we invade Iraq.' But Tory Defence Minister Anna Soubry dismissed the remarks. She said: 'Austin Mitchell’s at it again, talking nonsense and insulting women with his absurd theories. To say that women don’t care about the big issues is just not true. 'Ed Miliband should make it absolutely clear he doesn’t agree with Mitchell’s ridiculous remarks.' Mr Mitchell said the parliamentary Labour party was undergoing ‘the biggest process of feminisation and rejuvenation embarked on since fabulous pink Camay soap promised to make us look a little lovelier each day’. But he added: ‘Whatever the state of Labour’s policies for the next Election, there is little doubt that it will be fought by a younger, more attractive body of candidates. Almost half of Labour's cabinet are women and Ed Miliband is understood to want to hit 50 per cent by the next election - up from 44 per cent today. Labour's leading women, pictured here, from left back row: Caroline Flint, Angela Eagle, Maria Eagle, Rosie Winterton, Emily Thornberry, Margaret Curran, Baronness Royall. Front row: Rachel Reeves, Liz Kendal, Harriet Harman, Yvette Cooper, Mary Creagh and Tessa Jowell. Labour introduced all women shortlists in 1993 and has since seen a surge in the number of female MPs - 81 out of 257. But Mr Mitchell said all-women shortlists were being imposed on regions such as Yorkshire and the North as a form of punishment ‘for their earlier male chauvinism’. He said: ‘If Labour wins in 2015, how a family-friendly, gentler party, less prepared for all-night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind, will face up to Tory hooligans who feel they’ve been unjustly deprived of a power that’s their due, is a more worrying matter.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Q:Article: At dawn on Friday, May 19, 1780, farmers in New England stopped to wonder at the pink color of the sun. By noon the sky had darkened to midnight blackness, causing Americans, still in the painful struggle of a prolonged war of independence, to light candles and tremble at thoughts of the Last Judgment. As the birds quieted and no storm accompanied the darkness, men and women crowded into churches, where one minister commented that \\"The people were very attentive.\\" John Greenleaf Whittier later wrote that \\"Men prayed, and women wept; all ears grew sharp . . .\\" A recent study of researchers, led by Richard Guyette from the University of Missouri's Tree Ring Laboratory, has shown that vast forest fires in the Algonquin Highlands of southern Ontario and elsewhere in Canada brought this event upon New England. The scientists have discovered \\"fire scars\\" on the rings for that year, left when the heat of a wildfire has killed a part of a tree's cambium . Evidence collected also points to a drought that year. An easterly wind and low barometric pressure helped force smoke into the upper atmosphere. \\"The record fits pretty close,\\" says Guyette. \\"We had the right fuel, the drought. The conditions were all there.\\" Lacking the ability to communicate quickly over long distances, Americans in 1780 remained in the dark about the event, which had disappeared by the next day. Over the next several months, the papers carried heated debates about what brought the darkness. Some were the voices of angry prediction, such as one Massachusetts farmer who wrote, \\"Oh! Backsliding New-England, attend now to the things which belong to your peace before they are forever hid from your eyes.\\" Others gave different answers. One stated that a \\"flaming star\\" had passed between the earth and the sun. Ash, argued another commentator. The debate, carried on throughout New England, where there were no scientific journals or academies yet, reflected an unfolding culture of scientific enquiry already sweeping the Western world, a revolution...

The word Mriga, in many Indian languages including Malayalam, not only stands for deer, but for all animals and animal instincts (Mriga Thrishna). Shiva, as Mrigavyadha, is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings. In the epic Ramayana, Dasharatha, the father of Rama, is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark. During one of his hunting expeditions, he accidentally killed Shravana, mistaking him for game. During Rama's exile in the forest, Ravana kidnapped his wife, Sita, from their hut, while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer, and his brother Lakshman went after him.

Premise: - Soothingly simplistic thesis for commercial success - Astute marketing for commercial success Hypothesis: - Well-written book - Well-marketed book - Book sold well Step 2: Analyze if the premise supports the hypothesis. Premise elaborates that the book's commercial success relies on two factors: 1. Its soothingly simplistic thesis 2.

If you are a woman and marry an Emirati citizen, you will not automatically become an Emirati citizen. As a woman, you can get Emirati citizenship as a dependent of your husband, if your husband is an Emirati citizen. Women in the UAE are considered dependents either of their husbands or their fathers, regardless of whether they work or live independently. Women cannot pass on their Emirati citizenship. If you are a man and marry an Emirati woman, you will never be able to get Emirati citizenship as a result of being married to her, no matter how long the marriage lasts. Once you marry an Emirati citizen, you will generally have the right to reside in the UAE with your spouse. However, you will not have the benefits of being a citizen. When you get married, go to the General Directorate of Residence and Foreign Affairs (GDRFA). Bring your marriage certificate and identification. Tell them that you want to become a national, and they will give you forms to complete. If you are a man and marry an Emirati woman, any children your wife gives birth to will not be Emirati citizens. They will have to wait until they are 18 to apply for citizenship, and in the meantime you will have to pay for education and healthcare for the child that Emirati citizens get for free. If you marry an Emirati citizen, you will not become eligible for Emirati citizenship until you have been married for 3 years from the date you expressed your intent to become a national. Keep in mind this rule only applies to women who marry men who are Emirati citizens. A man who marries an Emirati woman will not be eligible for citizenship by virtue of the marriage. The UAE does not recognize dual citizenship. If you want to become an Emirati citizen through marriage, you must be willing to revoke any citizenship you currently have. Contact the embassy or consulate of your country of origin to find out what you need to do to officially revoke your citizenship. To apply for citizenship, your husband must complete a form and supply documents to the GDRFA that prove your identity and indicate your desire to become a citizen of the UAE. You will have to pay a fee for the request to be processed. You must be present with your husband when he submits the form and documents. Summary:","completion":"In the UAE, women and men don't have the same citizenship rights. If a woman marries a man from the UAE, she won't automatically become a citizen, but she can become a citizen if her husband is one. Women are considered dependents of their husbands or fathers.

Movie plot title: Because I Said So Movie plot: The movie focuses on Daphne (Diane Keaton), the loving but over-bearing mother of three girls, in particular Milly (Mandy Moore). Her other daughters Maggie (Lauren Graham) and Mae (Piper Perabo) are happily married but Milly has recently broken up with her boyfriend, and Daphne is concerned. Daphne fears that her daughter cannot find a good man on her own so she secretly places a personal ad for her daughter. She finds a potential candidate, Jason (Tom Everett Scott), and tries to orchestrate a chance meeting of the two. The plan seems flawless until Milly finds her own date, guitarist Johnny (Gabriel Macht), who happens to be a candidate Daphne rejected before. Milly is unaware of her mother's scheming and begins relationships with both Jason and Johnny at the same time, with neither aware of the other. Inevitably, this double-dating takes its toll and Milly becomes estranged from both Jason and Johnny. In Jason's case, it is because she discovers Daphne's scheming. Meanwhile, Daphne stumbles upon her own perfect match after being alone for many years and begins to challenge her search for the perfect match for Milly. Milly also realizes she has a choice to be the daughter her mother wants her to be, or to be the woman she wants herself to be.

The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - With no sign of Judgment Day arriving on Saturday as forecast by an 89 year-old California evangelical broadcaster, followers were faced with trying to make sense of his failed pronouncement. Harold Camping, the former civil engineer who heads the Family Radio Network of Christian stations, had been unwavering in his message that believers would be swept to heaven on May 21. His Oakland, California-based network broadcasts over 66 U.S. stations and through international affiliates. With the help of supporters it posted at least 2,000 billboards around the United States warning of the Judgment Day. In New York, retired transportation agency worker Robert Fitzpatrick was inspired by Camping's message to spend over 140,000 of his savings on subway posters and outdoor advertisements warning of the May 21 Judgment Day. As he stood in Times Square in New York surrounded by onlookers, Fitzpatrick, 60, carried a Bible and handed out leaflets as he waited for Judgment Day to begin. By his own reading of Bible, which was slightly different than Camping's, Fitzgerald expected the great worldwide event to begin at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. When the hour came and went, he said: \\"I do not understand why ...,\\" as his speech broke off and he looked at his watch. \\"I do not understand why nothing has happened.\\" Camping, who previously made a failed prediction Jesus Christ would return to Earth in 1994, had said doomsday would begin at 6 p.m. in the various time zones around the globe. NEW DAY COMES That meant it would begin in Asia and Oceania, but with midnight local time having come and gone in those areas, taking them well into May 22, and no indication of an apocalypse, Camping seemed to have gone silent. During the day, his Family Radio played recorded church music, devotionals and life advice unrelated to Judgment Day. The headquarters of his network was shuttered on Friday and Saturday, with a sign in the door that read \\"This Office is Closed. Sorry we missed you!\\" Camping, whose deep sonorous voice is frequently heard on his radio network expounding the Bible, could not be reached for comment. The shades were drawn and no one answered the door at his house in Alameda, California. Sheila Doan, 65, who has lived next door to Camping since 1971, said he is a good neighbor and she was concerned about Camping and his wife because of the attention his pronouncement has received. \\"I'm concerned for them, that somebody would possibly do something stupid, you just don't know in this world what's going to happen,\\" she said. Tom Evans, a spokesman for Camping, said earlier this week that at least several tens of thousands of people listen to Family Radio's message. The network is heard in more than 30 languages through international affiliates, according to Family Radio. In recent weeks, dozens of Camping's followers had crossed the United States in recreational vehicles emblazoned with the May 21 warning. Volunteers also handed out pamphlets as far away as the Philippines, telling people God had left clear signs the world was coming to an end. In Camping's description of Judgment Day, the Earth would be wrenched in a great earthquake and many inhabitants would perish in the coming months, until the planet's total destruction on October 21. On Saturday, some atheists in different parts of the country held celebrations and get-togethers to mark the failure of Camping's May 21 prediction to come true. In Oakland, the same city where Camping's network is based, over 200 people gathered at an atheist convention where speakers joked about the Judgment Day pronouncement and a vendor sold jewelry with the words \\"Good without God.\\" Cara Lee Hickey, 32, a Christian turned atheist, said Camping's prediction got people talking. \\"I've heard a lot of name-calling, but most of it is from other Christians calling him a false prophet,\\" she said. (Additional reporting by Erik Tavcar, Jonathan Allen and Noel Randewich; Writing by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Jerry Norton) ||||| Sue Espinoza was planted before the television, awaiting news of her father's now infamous prediction: cataclysmic earthquakes auguring the end of humanity.God's wrath was supposed to begin in New Zealand and then race across the globe, leaving millions of bodies wherever the clock struck 6 p.m. But the hours ticked by, and New Zealand survived. Time zone by time zone, the apocalypse failed to materialize.On Saturday morning, Espinoza, 60, received a phone call from her father, Harold Camping, the 89-year-old Oakland preacher who has spent some 100 million — and countless hours on his radio and TV show — announcing May 21 as Judgment Day. \\"He just said, 'I'm a little bewildered that it didn't happen, but it's still May 21 [in the United States],'\\" Espinoza said, standing in the doorway of her Alameda home. \\"It's going to be May 21 from now until midnight.\\"But to others who put stock in Camping's prophecy, disillusionment was already profound by late morning. To them, it was clear the world and its woes would make it through the weekend.Keith Bauer, a 38-year-old tractor-trailer driver from Westminster, Md., took last week off from work, packed his wife, young son and a relative in their SUV and crossed the country.If it was his last week on Earth, he wanted to see parts of it he'd always heard about but missed, such as the Grand Canyon. With maxed-out credit cards and a growing mountain of bills, he said, the rapture would have been a relief.On Saturday morning, Bauer was parked in front of the Oakland headquarters of Camping's Family Radio empire, half expecting to see an angry mob of disenchanted believers howling for the preacher's head. The office was closed, and the street was mostly deserted save for journalists.Bauer said he was not bitter. \\"Worst-case scenario for me, I got to see the country,\\" he said. \\"If I should be angry at anybody, it should be me.\\"Tom Evans, who acted as Camping's PR aide in recent months, took his family to Ohio to await the rapture. Early next week, he said, he would be returning to California.\\"You can imagine we're pretty disappointed, but the word of God is still true,\\" he said. \\"We obviously went too far, and that's something we need to learn from.\\"Despite the failure of Camping's prediction, however, he said he might continue working for him.\\"As bad as it appears—and there's no getting around it, it is bad, flat-out—I have not found anything close to the faithfulness of Family Radio,\\" he said.Others had risked a lot more on Camping's prediction, quitting jobs, abandoning relationships, volunteering months of their time to spread the word. Matt Tuter, the longtime producer of Camping's radio and television call-in show, said Saturday that he expected there to be \\"a lot of angry people\\" as reality proved Camping wrong.Tuter said Family Radio's AM station in Sacramento had been \\"severely vandalized\\" Friday night or Saturday morning, with air conditioning units yanked out and 25,000 worth of copper stripped from the equipment. He thinks it must have been an angry listener. He was off Saturday but planned to drive past the headquarters \\"and make sure nothing's burning.\\"Camping himself, who has given innumerable interviews in recent months, was staying out of sight Saturday. No one answered the door at his Alameda home, though neighbors said he was there.By late afternoon, a small crowd had gathered in front of Camping's Oakland headquarters. There were atheists blowing up balloons in human form, which were released into the sky just after 6 p.m. in a mockery of the rapture. Someone played a CD of \\"The End\\" by the Doors, amid much laughter.There were also Christians, like James Bynum, a 45-year-old deacon at Calvary Baptist Church in Milpitas, holding signs that declared Harold Camping a false prophet. He said he was there to comfort disillusioned believers.\\"Harold Camping will never hand out poisoned Kool-Aid,\\" Bynum said. \\"It's not that kind of a cult. But he has set up a system that will destroy some people's lives.\\" ||||| 'Judgment Day' came and went on Saturday, and John Ramsey hasn't been able to sleep. The 25-year-old Harrison, N.J. resident had rearranged his life in recent months to devote himself to spreading a fringe California preacher's prediction that May 21 would bring worldwide earthquakes and usher in a five-month period of misery before the world's destruction. Like many of those convinced of the Rapture was pending, Ramsey quit his job, donated \\"a couple thousand\\" to Harold Camping's Family Radio network and convinced family members to join him to spread news of the Rapture on Manhattan streets. His family nervously huddled in their apartment living room Saturday, holding their Bibles open, switching between CNN, Facebook and Google for news of quakes in the Pacific. They cried. They hugged. They argued. But mostly, they waited. Nothing happened. On Sunday, a dejected Ramsey said he faces a \\"mixed bag.\\" He has to find a new job. So does his mother. His 19-year-old brother, who had quit high school the year prior (\\"It's pointless to graduate,\\" the brother had said), is thinking of re-enrolling or finding employment. His wife, Marcia Paladines, had come to accept that she might never meet her unborn baby, whom she and Ramsey had named John Moses. Now, she's praying for a healthy birth. The child is due as early as Friday. \\"Life goes on,\\" Ramsey said Sunday. \\"I get to live. I get to be a dad.\\" The May 21 prediction came from the Biblical numerology of Harold Camping, an 89-year-old televangelist who owns the Oakland, Calif.-based Christian Family Radio network. Camping had previously predicted a similar end-times scenario in 1994. Several Camping followers previously interviewed by The Huffington Post did not return phone calls and emails Sunday. But a few did publicly declare their reactions. WATCH: \\"I guess no man knows the day or the hour,\\" said Peter Lombardi, a 44-year-old from Jersey City, N.J. who had had taken an \\"indefinite break\\" from his job in April to preach about May 21. He had fitted his Dodge minivan with stickers proclaiming the \\"awesome news\\" of Judgment Day and paraded with neon green Caravans through Manhattan's business districts to hand hundreds of fliers about the date. On Sunday, he was peeling the stickers off. Lombardi said he is going back to work -- he owns a construction business -- and said he has \\"no regrets.\\" He added, \\"I'm not disappointed. I'm still living today.\\" He believes Camping and others must have read the Bible incorrectly. Lombardi had donated 1,100 to Family Radio in recent months to help the organization purchase thousands of billboards and other ads throughout the country, but said he doesn't expect any of his money back. \\"What can you do?\\" he said. \\"I don't think they were scamming me, but I am definitely waiting to see what they say Monday on the radio show.\\" \\"It's not [Camping's] fault,\\" said Ramsey, who added he also won't ask for his money back. \\"Nobody held a gun to my head. I read the Bible. The math added up. I don't think anybody would do something like this without meaning it.\\" Camping was mostly silent over the weekend, but he spoke briefly outside his Alameda, Calif. home on Sunday with a San Francisco Chronicle Reporter. \\"It has been a really tough weekend,\\" he said, adding he was \\"flabbergasted\\" and \\"looking for answers.\\" Camping said he would make a detailed announcement on Monday. The Family Radio web site has not been updated. A countdown on the site says there are zero days left to 'Judgment Day' and an image shows the numbers \\"2012\\" crossed out. \\"Mr. Camping certainly won't shy away from this,\\" Family Radio spokesman Tom Evans told The Huffington Post on Sunday, adding \\"how that will happen will be forthcoming.\\" Evans, who had spent 'Judgment Day' with his wife and kids, said he was happy that he gets more time to be with his family, but added that \\"a believer's highest hope is to be with the Lord forever.\\" As for his belief in the second coming, \\"nothing has changed other than the ramifications for Family Radio and Mr. Camping's credibility in the world.\\" After Camping's failed Rapture prediction in 1994, Evans stayed with Family Radio, but he declined to say whether he would stay on the job this time. WATCH: Camping, who told The Huffington Post last week that May 21 was \\"no laughing matter,\\" had refused to discuss what he would do with donations if the day passed without event. In recent months, followers have given generously to his company, which runs 66 radio stations in the U.S. and is worth at least 120 million. On Sunday, Evans said Family Radio's assets \\"far outweigh its liabilities,\\" and that it will \\"certainly do everything it can to take care of people.\\" But he said that there has been no decision on giving money back to donors. In 2009, the last year Family Radio publicly released a tax return, the group reported 18.4 million in income from contributions and 1 million from investments and other income. It spent 36.7 million and employed 348 people paid a total of more than 9 million in wages and benefits. Camping has said he has worked without pay for several years. Articles have noted that the station's lease runs through 2023 and that several employees were planning last week to show up to work on Monday. Followers like Ramsey and Lombardi said they had few hard feelings toward Camping and still agreed with some of the self-taught preacher's views, such as one that says all churches and denominations have been corrupted. \\"I have learned to study the Bible really well. This guy has opened my eyes to a lot of truths,\\" said Lombardi. \\"If he makes another prediction, I can't tell you what I am going to do,\\" said Ramsey. \\"But I've really taken an interest in the Bible. I know it's the word of God. And I've been reading into more parts today.\\" He quoted Mark 13:22: \\"For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall [show] signs and wonders, to seduce, if [it were] possible, even the elect.\\" ||||| the end is near Long Island Firefighter’s Wait for the Rapture Goes Unfulfilled “Wanna order a pizza?\\" Jeff asks. \\"I don’t know if we’ll have time to eat it, but we might as well get it.” It is 4:48 p.m. on May 21, and earthquakes have not yet riven the Earth. “When the sky goes dark and you feel a rumbling, I’m going to ask you and the kids to step outside very quickly,\\" Jeff told me when I first arrived at his small ranch house in Hicksville, Long Island. \\"God willing, we’ll all be taken up in a whirlwind to Heaven. I know it might sound strange, but that’s my understanding of how it’s going to go.” His 6-year-old son was in the living room, playing a Star Wars game on the Wii. His 4-year-old daughter, wearing a Spider-Man bike helmet from a recent tricycle trip around the backyard, tapped me on the shoulder to show me a crayon drawing of a rainbow. Jeff orders a large Sicilian pie for delivery. “And please put a rush on it,” he tells the person taking his order. “We’re — we’re in a rush here.” Jeff is visibly nervous now, taking deep breaths. “And listen,” he says into the phone, “if you have a radio, put on 94.7. They’re talking about Judgment Day and telling everyone to ask God for mercy. It's important.” WFME 94.7 is the New York outlet for Family Radio, the station Jeff was listening to three years ago when he heard Harold Camping prophesying the End of Days. That's when Jeff left the Catholic Church and begin studying Biblical numerology. Thousands of Camping's followers fervently believe that the Rapture will occur on May 21, 2011; millions more know of the prophecy thanks to Family Radio billboards and newspaper ads. Jeff, 44, is a muscular firefighter from Flushing with a square jawline. When the pizza arrives, Jeff calls his friend Ron, “One of the only true believers I know who will talk to me about this stuff,\\" and they reassure each other by speakerphone, parsing choice psalms and proverbs. “So, from the Biblical evidence you’re finding,” Jeff asks Ron, “at what hour do we now think this earthquake is going to happen?” According to Harold Camping, the earthquakes were to start at 6 p.m. at the International Date Line — 2 a.m. Eastern Time — and spread eastward around the world. When Jeff woke up on Saturday and everything was still calm, he decided this was a potentially ominous sign: “This morning the sky was crystal clear, just like 9/11. I was a firefighter then, and I couldn’t believe that on such a beautiful day, such destruction could come.” With the Rapture seemingly running behind schedule, Jeff hypothesized then predicted the earthquakes would come between 3 and 5 p.m. ET, and would wreak destruction over all the world simultaneously. After three, his prediction changed again: “Six now looks more likely, but really it might be any time before midnight.” Ron, over the phone, refuses to predict the hour. “In all this time, I’ve always been blown away by the evidence pointing to the day, but never the exact hour.” Rosana, Jeff’s wife, who had been out at a friend's birthday party, comes home a little after six. “What, nothing happened?” she asks with no small amount of contempt. Jeff buries his head in his Bible. He and Ron debate the virtues of King Solomon for another hour, while Rosana loudly opens and closes cabinets. Jeff warms up another slice of pizza and pours Pepsi into a Miller Lite pint glass. Finally, he hangs up the phone. Rosana turns to face him. “Jeff, starting at midnight tonight, I don’t want to hear any more of this crap, okay?” “Look,” he says, “I told you I knew the day, but I never claimed to know the hour—“ “I don’t want to hear it, Jeff. I’m telling you, I can’t take it.” Rosana gives me a helpless look, and she and I go into another room to chat. “I don’t know what happened to him,” she whispers to me. “He used to be normal. Now all he can talk about is the Bible and this May 21 stuff. He took all his vacation days in a row, so all he’s doing the last four weeks is sitting around reading the Bible and driving me nuts. Thank God he didn’t quit his job like some of them did.” Meanwhile, Jeff is checking his text messages. “There are a bunch of friends here who are mocking me,” he says. “And that’s all right! I just put on my spiritual shield and endure.” Ron calls again, and he and Jeff come up with a new interpretation: May 21 will not end, technically, until midnight in Hawaii. “There will be a lot of people mocking me after midnight tonight if nothing does happen,” Jeff says, breathing quickly again, “but what they don’t realize is that May 21 hasn’t been completed everywhere in the world yet. So we really can’t tell anything until six in the morning here. That’s when the truth will really be tested.” ||||| The hour of the apocalypse came quietly and went the same way _ leaving those who believed that Saturday evening would mark the world's end confused, or more faithful, or just philosophical.

(Associated Press) Believers had spent months warning the world of the pending cataclysm. Some had given away earthly belongings. Others took long journeys to be with loved ones. And there were those who drained their savings accounts. All were responding to the May 21 doomsday message by Harold Camping, an 89-year-old retired civil engineer who has built a multi-million-dollar Christian media empire that publicizes his apocalyptic prediction. \\"I had some skepticism but I was trying to push the skepticism away because I believe in God,\\" said Keith Bauer _ who hopped in his minivan in Maryland and drove his family 3,000 miles (5,000 kilometers) to California for the Rapture. He started his day in the bright morning sun outside Camping's gated Oakland headquarters of Family Radio International. \\"I was hoping for it because I think heaven would be a lot better than this earth,\\" said Bauer, a tractor-trailer driver who began the voyage west last week, figuring that if he \\"worked last week, I wouldn't have gotten paid anyway, if the Rapture did happen.\\" According to Camping, the destruction was likely to have begun its worldwide march as it became 6 p.m. in the various time zones, although some believers said Saturday the exact timing was never written in stone. He had been projecting the apocalyptic prediction for years far and wide via broadcasts and websites. In New York's Times Square, Robert Fitzpatrick, of Staten Island, said he was surprised when the six o'clock hour simply came and went. He had spent his own money to put up advertising about the end of the world. \\"I can't tell you what I feel right now,\\" he said, surrounded by tourists. \\"Obviously, I haven't understood it correctly because we're still here.\\" Many followers said the delay was a further test from God to persevere in their faith. \\"It's still May 21 and God's going to bring it,\\" said Family Radio's special projects coordinator Michael Garcia, who spent Saturday morning praying and drinking two last cups of coffee with his wife at home in Alameda. \\"When you say something and it doesn't happen, your pride is what's hurt. But who needs pride? God said he resists the proud and gives grace to the humble.\\" The Internet was alive with discussion, humorous or not, about the end of the world and its apparent failure to occur on cue. Many tweets declared Camping's prediction a dud or shared, tongue-in-cheek, their relief at not having to do weekend chores or take a shower. The top trends on Twitter at midday included, at No. 1, \\"endofworldconfessions,\\" followed by \\"myraptureplaylist.\\" As 6 p.m. approached in California, some 100 people gathered outside Family Radio International headquarters in Oakland, although it appeared none of the believers of the prophecy were among them. Camping's radio stations, TV channels, satellite broadcasts and website are controlled from a modest building sandwiched between an auto shop and a palm reader's business. Christian leaders from across the spectrum widely dismissed the prophecy, and members of a local church concerned Camping's followers could slip into a deep depression come Sunday were part of the crowd outside Family Radio International. They held signs declaring Camping a false prophet as motorists drove by. \\"The cold, hard reality is going to hit them that they did this, and it was false and they basically emptied out everything to follow a false teacher,\\" the Rev. Jacob Denys, of the Milpitas-based Calvary Bible Church, said earlier. \\"We're not all about doom and gloom. Our message is a message of salvation and of hope.\\" About a dozen people in a partying mood were also outside Family Radio International, creating a carnival-like atmosphere as they strolled in a variety of costumes that portrayed monks, Jesus Christ and other figures. \\"Am I relieved? Yeah. I've got a lot going on,\\" Peter Erwin, a student from Oakland, said, with a hint of sarcasm. \\"Trying to get specific about the end of the world is crazy.\\" Revelers counted down the seconds before the anticipated hour, and people began dancing to music as the clock struck 6 p.m. Some released shoe-shaped helium balloons into the sky in an apparent reference to the Rapture. Camping has preached that some 200 million people would be saved, and that those left behind would die in a series of scourges visiting Earth until the globe is consumed by a fireball on Oct. 21. Family Radio International's message has been broadcast in 61 languages. He has said that his earlier apocalyptic prediction in 1994 didn't come true because of a mathematical error. \\"I'm not embarrassed about it. It was just the fact that it was premature,\\" he told The Associated Press last month. But this time, he said, \\"there is ... no possibility that it will not happen.\\" As Saturday drew nearer, followers reported that donations grew, allowing Family Radio to spend millions on more than 5,000 billboards and 20 RVs plastered with the doomsday message. In 2009, the nonprofit reported in IRS filings that it received 18.3 million in donations, and had assets of more than 104 million, including 34 million in stocks or other publicly traded securities. Marie Exley, who helped put up apocalypse-themed billboards in Israel, Jordan and Lebanon, said the money allowed the nonprofit to reach as many souls as possible. She said she and her husband, mother and brother read the Bible and stayed close to the television news on Friday night awaiting word of an earthquake in the southern hemisphere. When that did not happen, she said fellow believers began reaching out to reassure one another of their faith. \\"Some people were saying it was going to be an earthquake at that specific time in New Zealand and be a rolling judgment, but God is keeping us in our place and saying you may know the day but you don't know the hour,\\" she said Saturday, speaking from Bozeman, Montana. \\"The day is not over, it's just the morning, and we have to endure until the end.\\" Still, the world wasn't without its normal and sometimes dreadful disturbances Saturday. Among them: a tornado killed one person and damaged at least 20 homes in Kansas, a 6.1-magnitude quake stuck 600 miles (1,100 kilometers) off New Zealand with no reports of injury, a much smaller quake, 3.6, was felt my many people Saturday evening in the San Francisco Bay area, and Iceland's most active volcano started erupting. Camping, who lives a few miles (kilometers) from his radio station, was not home late morning Saturday, and an additional attempt to seek comment from him late in the evening also was unsuccessful, with no one answering his front door. Earlier in the day, Sheila Doan, 65, Camping's next-door-neighbor of 40 years, was outside gardening and said the worldwide spotlight on his May 21 forecast has attracted far more attention than the 1994 prediction. Doan said she is a Christian and while she respects her neighbor, she doesn't share his views. \\"I wouldn't consider Mr. Camping a close friend and wouldn't have him over for dinner or anything, but if he needs anything, we are there for him,\\" Doan said. ___ Associated Press reporters Terry Chea in Oakland, Don Babwin in Chicago, Mike Householder in Detroit, Janet McConnaughey in New Orleans, David R. Martin in New York and video journalist Haven Daley in San Francisco contributed to this report.

His message, that believers would be swept to heaven on May 21, led many of his followers to give away their possessions, spend their savings, and make other significant life changes. When the day came and went without any cataclysmic events, these followers were left to make sense of the situation. Some theories emerged about potential miscalculations, and new predictions were made, but ultimately, the followers were left disillusioned and having to rebuild their lives after relying on the false prophecy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Process: - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation - The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment. Question: suppose less vegetation available happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"Less effect. To fully understand the implications of the supposed perturbation and its connection with the damage caused by acid rain, let us first delve into the process mentioned earlier: 1. Acid rain is produced by chemicals, such as sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxide (NOx), which reach into the atmosphere. These chemicals are primarily released through the burning of fossil fuels, industrial processes, and vehicular emissions. 2. Upon reaching the atmosphere, these chemicals undergo numerous chemical reactions, turning into sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and nitric acid (HNO₃). These acids then mix with rainwater, creating acid rain. 3. Acid rain falls onto the ground and can have detrimental effects on various aspects of the environment, such as soil, rock formations, and vegetation. 4. The acid rain starts to react with rocks, leading to a process known as chemical weathering. This weathering can cause rocks to break down and weaken, giving rise to the potential for erosion and environmental damage. 5. As mentioned, acid rain also destroys vegetation. Acid deposition in soils can lead to a decrease in vital nutrients and an increase in toxic elements, causing harm to plant life and impeding plant growth. 6. The lack of vegetation that results from acid rain leads to alterations in the surrounding environment, such as increased soil erosion and destabilization of ecosystems. Now, considering the question, if there is less vegetation available and this reduced vegetation coverage is assumed to be the outcome of some factor other than acid rain, it can be inferred that it would have a less effect on the damage caused by acid rain. This is primarily due to three reasons: 1. With fewer plants and vegetation in the affected areas, there would be fewer targets for acid rain to damage directly. As a result, the immediate impact of acid rain on the local vegetation and ecosystems would be reduced. 2. The reduced vegetation coverage can potentially lead to a decrease in transpiration, which in turn may affect the local water cycle. This alteration in the water cycle could result in a decreased frequency or intensity of precipitation events, meaning that less acid rain might fall in these areas. 3. Since the reduced vegetation coverage is not a direct result of acid rain, it implies that other factors such as land-use changes, deforestation, or climatic variations are responsible for this phenomenon. These factors often entail mitigation and management approaches that are different from those addressing acid rain. Therefore, the impact of acid rain must also be assessed and managed differently, considering its potential interactions with these other factors. However, it is essential to note that less damage from acid rain does not imply the overall environmental impact is reduced. The other factors responsible for decreased vegetation might have their consequences, making it necessary to continue exploring strategies that minimize acid rain emissions and monitor the long-term effects the perturbation may have."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You can find tables that show the pH value of different fruits and vegetables. The fruits such as apples are barely acidic so they have a pH value that is higher or lower? A:","completion":"Apples have a pH value which is lower than 7, making them an acidic fruit. However, compared to other fruits, apples are considered to be mildly or barely acidic. This means that their pH value is not extremely low, but rather closer to 7, which is the neutral pH value. So, the pH value of apples is lower than the neutral pH value, but higher than the pH values of more strongly acidic fruits, such as lemons and oranges. To understand this better, let's review the pH scale briefly. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 0 being the most acidic, 14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral. Substances with a pH value below 7 are considered acidic, while those with a pH value above 7 are considered alkaline or basic. Each unit on the scale represents a tenfold change in acidity or basicity. Now, the pH value of apples may vary slightly depending on the variety and ripeness of the fruit. Generally speaking, apples have a pH value that ranges from approximately 3.3 to 4.0. This makes apples acidic but not as acidic as other fruits like lemons, which have a pH value of around 2.0, or oranges, which have a pH value of around 3.0 to 4.0. In summary, the pH value of apples is lower than the neutral pH value of 7, indicating that they are acidic. However, apples are considered to be mildly or barely acidic compared to other fruits, as their pH value is higher than that of more strongly acidic fruits like lemons and oranges."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

As the round object rolls down the ramp it will what? - sound well - fly - become broken - gain speed - fall into hole The best answer is Answer:","completion":"As the round object rolls down the ramp, it will gain speed. This phenomenon can be explained by the principles of physics, specifically through concepts related to energy conservation and motion. When a round object is placed on an inclined ramp, it experiences a gravitational force pulling it towards the ground. This force acts as the driving force for the object's movement down the slope. At the same time, the combination of the ramp's angle and the object's weight and shape will determine the amount of friction and air resistance that the object will experience, which could slightly dampen its speed. Initially, the object has potential energy at the top of the ramp due to its elevated position. As it begins to roll down, this potential energy is gradually converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy associated with the object's motion. This conversion continues until the round object reaches the bottom of the ramp, at which point it would have maximized its kinetic energy and effectively gained speed throughout the descent. The other options mentioned: 1. Sound Well: The round object may produce a sound as it rolls, but this only depends on the specific object's material and the surface of the ramp. Therefore, this is not the best answer. 2. Fly: The round object will not fly unless there are external forces or special conditions in play, such as upward drafts of air or it reaching a high enough velocity to lift off the ground due to aerodynamics, which is not likely just from rolling down a ramp. 3. Become broken: The round object may or may not become broken as it rolls down the ramp. This would depend on factors such as material, durability, and the condition of the ramp. It is not guaranteed that the round object will break, so this is not the best answer. 4. Fall into a hole: There is no specific information provided about the presence of a hole at the bottom of the ramp or on the ramp itself. If a hole exists, it is circumstantial, and the object may fall into it, but this is not a universal outcome for all round objects rolling down ramps. Therefore, this is not the best answer. To summarize, the best answer is that the round object will gain speed as it rolls down the ramp due to the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy. This phenomenon is governed by fundamental principles of physics and is a generalizable outcome for round objects rolling down ramps, compared to the other options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The boy shot the target more times than the tree because the Select from: I. tree was farther away from him.; II. target was farther away from him.;","completion":"The boy shot the target more times than the tree because the tree was farther away from him. This discrepancy in accuracy can be attributed to several factors, including the distance to the target, the size of the tree, the boy's experience, the visibility, and the weather conditions. I. Tree was farther away from him. 1. Distance to the target: The further away the tree was from the boy, the more difficult it would be for him to aim and accurately shoot at it. This is due to how projectiles, such as the arrow or bullet being used, follow a trajectory and are affected by external forces like gravity, wind, and air resistance. As the distance increases, the projectile's path will deviate more from its intended course, making it more challenging to accurately hit the tree. 2. Size of the tree: Depending on the size and shape of the tree, it might have been more challenging to shoot at compared to a specific target. The larger a target, the easier it is to hit. If the target were larger than the tree, it would be more natural for him to score hits on the target, even if it was at roughly the same distance as the tree. 3. The boy's experience: The boy could have had more practice shooting at targets set at a consistent distance, and consequently, was more accustomed to shooting at that range. He might have had difficulty adjusting his aim for the tree that was farther away because of his lack of experience with differing distances. 4. Visibility: The visibility of the target and the tree could have played a significant role in determining the boy's accuracy. The target may have been more visually distinct or easier to see due to color, contrast, or lighting. The tree, on the other hand, might have been partially obscured by leaves, branches, or shadows, making it more difficult to discern and aim at accurately. 5. Weather conditions: Wind, rain, and other meteorological factors could have affected the boy's ability to shoot the tree positioned farther away. Wind, in particular, can influence the projectile trajectory, causing it to deviate from the intended path if it must travel a greater distance. Moreover, poor weather conditions such as rain or fog can reduce visibility, hampering the boy's ability to see the tree clearly and aim correctly. In conclusion, the boy's greater success shooting the target compared to the tree can be mainly attributed to the tree being farther away from him. This distance amplified various challenging elements like the trajectory of the projectile, visibility, and weather conditions. Additionally, factors such as the target and tree sizes and the boy's experience could have played a role in his accuracy. A combination of these factors ultimately led to the boy hitting the target more times than the tree."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is crucial to ask this question before you create your model or you may end up creating a model that does not meet your objective. Do you want to predict something? Find out how to regulate something? Or do something else? For example, imagine you want to know how much room you have in a storage unit to see how many boxes you can put into it. You will be creating a model to predict the amount of space that is in your storage unit. What data do you already have? Make a list of the data that has been given. As you list the data, decide what pieces are most relevant and which pieces are not relevant. You should also list any information that can be assumed based on what you already know. Keep in mind that you may have to take measurements to find the data that you need. To find out how much room you have in your storage unit, you will need to measure the unit's height, width, and length. Do you need to consider factors like gravity, volume, time, etc.? Make a note of any factors that will need to be considered when you create the model. To determine the amount of space that you have in your storage unit, you will need to find the volume. You also need to keep in mind that there will be some wasted space, since some objects may be irregular and that will make it difficult to use every inch of the storage unit. What equations and formulas will you need in order to find your answer? How will you apply these equations and formulas? Make sure that you have a clear understanding of how to plug the data that you have into the equation. To find the volume of the storage unit, you will need to use the equation V= h x w x l There is no need to re-invent the wheel if somebody else has developed a model that may suit your purposes already. Check in your textbook or ask your teacher. Just remember to make sure that someone else’s model will work for your situation. To get an idea of how to find the volume using the equation you have identified, check your textbook or ask your teacher. A simple mathematical model may not require a diagram. However, if you are creating a complex model, a diagram may help you determine if your model will work. Draw a diagram to represent the actual model you plan to make. Make sure to incorporate your data into your diagram to help guide you when you create the actual model. Summary:","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of defining the objective of creating a model before starting the process. To do so, one must identify the desired data, whether it is for prediction, regulation, or any other purpose. In the given example, the objective is to create a model to predict the amount of space in a storage unit. One must list the available data and determine which pieces are relevant, making note of any assumptions or measurements required. Factors such as gravity, volume, and time should be considered when creating the model. To determine the storage unit's space, the volume must be calculated, accounting for possible wasted space due to irregular objects. Utilize existing equations and formulas, understanding how to apply them to your data. In this case, the volume is calculated through V = h x w x l. It is recommended to explore existing models developed by others, utilizing textbooks or teachers as resources, and ensuring their applicability to your situation. Diagrams can be useful for complex models to help visualize the data and its application to the model.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I have never had an experience with a hotel as bad as the one I had this past weekend at the Stratosphere in Las Vegas. This week is my 36th birthday; so to celebrate, I decided, on the spur of the moment, to make a trip to Vegas to go to one of my favorite clubs last weekend. I mean, why not? This past year, I received a kidney transplant. No more dialysis, so now I could travel freely. I had the money. No reason not to, right? I originally wanted to just go and book whatever hotel room I could find while I was in Vegas itself, but at the urging of a close friend, I chose to go online and see if I could find a deal. I used a third party website, and found a room at the Statosphere for 67 per night. Since I was traveling late, and would not get there until after midnight, I booked it for Saturday, figuring I would stay overnight and come back to LA on Sunday. No problem, right? Apparently, in Las Vegas, days do not begin at midnight like they do everywhere else in the U.S. They begin at 3pm, which was naturally not indicated on my confirmation. So when I got to the Statosphere, and tried to check in at midnight itself, I was told that I would have to buy two days, because this was still considered Friday. No attempt to make good, just to charge me more money, a pattern I would later learn was typical for the Stratosphere. Across the street was a sleazy motel, so I figured I could just crash there for the night, and check into my room the next day. Since I did not have the much vaunted Statosphere for internet access, I searched for a wireless connection. As luck would have it, the city provides 5 wireless per day through Las Vegas.net. I bought two days, figured I would check in to the Statosphere the next day and all would be well. When I got to there, I learned why my room had been such a \\"bargain\\": it came with a glorious view of some storage area where apparently the hotel keeps scrap metal. Two windows worth, no less. But that wasn't as bad as learning that the Stratosphere BLOCKS wireless providers so you have to buy theirs... at 11 a day. Flabbergasted that a ritzy (cough!) hotel would be this cheap, I realized that I would have to use the phone to make my plans for the night. Not a big deal, I have a phone card, and their phone's display said local calls were free, except that, well, they're not. When I just got a rapid dialtone whenever I dialed nine, I tried calling the front desk for a solution. They put me on hold FOREVER. I tried other numbers - the concierge, the operator, SOMETHING - to find out what was wrong with my phone so I didn;t have to sit on hold, but to no avail. The Statosphere wanted me to hold on for five minutes, no matter what. So I did, only to learn that local calls are A DOLLAR each. What's on the phone, I guess, was put there by the manufacturer, because no one in their right mind would believe a luxury hotel would charge a buck each for LOCAL calls. But the Statosphere is not like other hotels. It's far worse. So I used the cell, got to where I needed to go, and got the Hell out of there, discovering my favorite thing about the Statosphere - check out is easy and fast. I'm sure they had to do that because they get so many. Bottom line, unless you're part of the 1%, stay at Circus Circus if you're going to Las Vegas on a budget. And stay as far from the Statosphere as you can. The tower, I now believe, was put in to distract you from how horrible this place is. Never again. Choose the sentiment of this review?

Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process is the colonization of an area by pioneer species, which are small, hardy plants and organisms that can grow in harsh environments with little to no soil. These pioneer species, such as lichens, mosses, and certain grasses, help break down rocks and organic material, contributing to the formation of the initial layer of soil. As these plants die and decompose, the soil gains organic material, leading to increasing fertility.

Context: “Have you ever been in a situation that was getting out of control and you were able to calm it down before it escalated further? What was the situation and what did you do or say?” As senior members of a Boy Scout Troop, other adults and I had to instruct two younger member on how to recognize and control emotions in the context of conflict. These two guys had a history of conflicts and I knew people won’t always be present to control them. They had to grow up and be self-sufficient. On one camping trip they yet again had another heated argument over something trivial that kept escalating. Rather than jump in, I wanted to see how they deescalate the situation on their own. Suddenly, one of them pulls out a pocket knife and says “[insert demand here] or I’m gonna [insert some action with a knife to a person].” The situation has clearly escalated too far. Immediately I rushed in and yelled, “STOP! DROP IT, NOW!” He immediately dropped the knife, sat down, and began crying. What happens after that is irrelevant. Perhaps it’s due to my quiet nature and sudden outburst that produced the shock effect. But more importantly the use of straight-forward, succinct commands can control the situation because all parties involved are automatically in natural fight-flight mode where elaborate, long explanations aren’t going to be interpreted correctly by listeners for the purposes of deescalating the situation’s climax. The long talk comes when the immediate conflict is temporarily resolved. * IMPORTANT NOTE: This incident is not a reflection on the Boy Scout of America, its spirit, or the use of such tools. The pocket knife is commonly used throughout camping trips. We have a set of rules and responsibilities set to the users so that they are used for the camping purposes.

If \\"Young boys are walking in galoshes.\\", can we conclude \\"The boys are walking.\\"?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"The boys are walking\\" based on the given statement, \\"Young boys are walking in galoshes.\\" To fully understand how we can make this conclusion, let's break down the given statement and the conclusion we want to draw. Given statement: \\"Young boys are walking in galoshes.\\" In this statement, we are provided with three main pieces of information: 1. The subjects are young boys. 2. The action they are performing is walking. 3. The additional information about their walking is that they are wearing galoshes. A brief analysis of this statement allows us to understand the situation. We know that there are young boys who are engaged in the action of walking. As they walk, they are wearing galoshes, which are a type of rubber or waterproof boot used to protect the feet from getting wet or dirty in puddles, rain, or muddy situations. Conclusion: \\"The boys are walking.\\" In the conclusion, we are concerned with two main ideas: 1. The subjects are boys (though the age descriptor \\"young\\" has been omitted). 2. The action they are performing is walking. Given the information presented in the initial statement, we can safely conclude that \\"The boys are walking\\" holds true. We have evidence of young boys involved in the act of walking, which directly correlates to the conclusion we want to draw. The descriptor \\"young\\" has been dropped from the conclusion, but this simplified statement still communicates the core idea. Moreover, the information about the boys wearing galoshes is not relevant to the conclusion itself. It merely serves as additional context to the given statement and helps paint a clearer picture of the situation. Whether the boys are wearing galoshes or not does not change the fact they are walking, and our conclusion remains unaffected by this detail.

Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world. He noticed that people have different skin colors. To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L.

Sam could reach the apple but not the orange because the","completion":"orange was situated on a higher branch, farther away from him. The sun was setting, casting a warm, golden light on the lush green leaves of the apple tree. The vibrant green made the ripe red apple stand out in stark contrast, practically begging Sam to seize the moment and pluck it from the branch. Standing on his tiptoes, he outstretched his arm, and after a little wiggling of his fingers, he was able to finally wrap them around the smooth, silky skin of the apple. On the other hand, just across the yard, the orange tree looked as though dressed in gown of verdant leaves and small, fragrant white blossoms. The scent of citrus wafted dreamily as the wind gently rustled through the boughs. While the orange tree was slightly taller than the apple tree, it wasn't the trunk height that presented a challenge to Sam; it was the particular location of the lone ripe, juicy orange that seemed out of reach. The orange appeared tantalizingly succulent and sweet, hanging on a narrow branch that extended precariously close to a weak, sun-faded fence. Wisps of peeling paint sluggishly danced in the breeze as the fence groaned under the weight of the burgeoning branch. Sam had not so long ago made a pact with his elderly, always-yelling neighbor, Mr. Mulligan, to not touch the fence nor let the apples from Sam's tree drop into his yard. It appeared that tempting orange was putting both of those promises to the test. Sam contemplated the options at his disposal to acquire the out-of-reach orange. He weighed the possibility of climbing the tree, but the height and the branch's fragile appearance caused his confidence to waver, casting doubt on the feasibility of this course of action. Armed with an apple from his own tree, Sam decided to explore other avenues to secure the coveted orange prize. Thoughts of makeshift ladders and reaching hooks briefly danced in his head, but once again, the lingering memory of Mr. Mulligan's hoarse voice and piercing glare thwarted Sam's plans. He sighed in resignation, accepting that, at least for today, the unattainable would remain just that. Returning his gaze to his freshly picked apple, Sam took a moment to appreciate its vibrant red hue, as the soft light from the encroaching twilight painted it in waning gold. Carefully lowering himself to the grassy ground below, he sank his teeth into the crisp, sweet fruit, allowing its refreshing juices to trickle down his throat. As he enjoyed the taste of the apple, Sam looked longingly at the orange tree, silently vowing that he would devise a new plan to reach the elusive orange. He decided to get up early the next day and retrieve a ladder or a long pole while Mr. Mulligan was still asleep, sharing his conquest with his friends later on. While the orange had escaped his grasp for now, Sam knew that with a little ingenuity, determination, and the courage to defy the odds, he would soon accomplish his goal and reap the sweet rewards of his efforts. The orange would not always remain out of reach, and when that day came, Sam would be ready to accept the challenge."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first official Paralympic Games, no longer open solely to war veterans, was held in Rome in 1960 Summer Paralympics. 400 athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games. Since 1960, the Paralympic Games have taken place in the same year as the Olympic Games. The Games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs; at the 1976 Summer Paralympics, athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a Summer Paralympics. With the inclusion of more disability classifications the 1976 Summer Games expanded to 1,600 athletes from 40 countries. The 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, South Korea, was another milestone for the Paralympic movement. It was in Seoul that the Paralympic Summer Games were held directly after the 1988 Summer Olympics, in the same host city, and using the same facilities. This set a precedent that was followed in 1992 Summer Paralympics, 1996 Summer Paralympics and 2000 Summer Paralympics. It was eventually formalized in an agreement between the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2001, and was extended through 2020. On March 10, 2018, the two committees further extended their contract to 2032. The 1992 Winter Paralympics were the first Winter Games to use the same facilities as the 1992 Winter Olympics.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the chapel that was dismantled in 1571? ? A middle Saxon pendant dating from 601–700 AD was discovered in a field in Little Thetford in 1952. This 3-centimetre (1.18 in) diameter by 1-centimetre (0.39 in) thick pendant, made from rock-crystal, gold, garnet, and amethyst coloured-glass, has been worked in a lathe. The workmanship is not of a high standard. Æthelberht of Kent was said to have built a church at Cratendune around 600 AD, about a mile from what is now Ely Cathedral. In 673 AD, Æthelthryth considered restoring this church, thought to have been destroyed by Penda of Mercia, but instead made what is now Ely Cathedral the site of her monastery. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery, used at some point between 410–1065 AD, was uncovered around 1945 near Little Thetford (52.376N, 0.2375E), and was thought to be this lost village of Cratendune. A deserted Saxon settlement, 410–1065 AD, examined in 1999 in Ely, may also be a candidate for this lost site of worship. Little Thetford means little public or people's ford—Old English lȳtel Thiutforda (c. 972) and Liteltedford [sic] (1086)—compare with Thetford, Norfolk—Old English Thēodford (late 9th century) and Tedfort (1086). The online Domesday Book records the settlement under the name Liteltetford [sic]. The first written evidence that Ely Abbey had inherited the Little Thetford lands was in the 12th-century chronicle, Liber Eliensis. The will of Ælfwaru (d. 1007), an Anglo-Saxon noblewoman, granted estates in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk to the Abbey, which included \\"... that land at Thetford and fisheries around those marshes\\". In 1110, Hervey le Breton, Bishop of Ely, granted the manor to William Brito, his Archdeacon and also his nephew. Chapel Hill in the village, near the river, commemorates the site of Harrimere Chapel, used since 1381. Some of the stone from this chapel, dismantled in 1571, was used in the building of St George's Church. By 1539, the Little Thetford manor and its estates contained arable land, pasture, gardens, and orchards.
