Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? James Black was born in Hackensack, New Jersey on 1 May 1800. James' mother died when he was very young and he had difficulty getting along with his stepmother. Black ran away from home to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at age 8 and was apprenticed to a silversmith. At age 18 he migrated westward and took jobs on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. During his travels, Black had befriended Elijah Stuart. Stuart opened a tavern at Washington and Black was hired by a local blacksmith named William Shaw. Black, due to his previous training, worked on firearms and knives while Shaw concentrated on horse shoes, wagon wheels, and the like. Black would later become a partner in the business with Shaw. Stuart's tavern would become famous as the place where Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, and William B. Travis created the plan for an independent Texas and Black would go on to create some of the world's finest knives. Black fell in love with his partner's daughter, Anne Shaw, and was forced out of the partnership when Shaw would not allow the marriage. Backed by the note he had received from the dissolved partnership Black purchased some land along the Cossatot River and established a blacksmith's shop, dam, and mill. Black's endeavor came to an end when he was thrown off of his land. Local officials claimed that the land was Indian treaty land and that Black could not legally inhabit it. Black then discovered that the note he had received from William Shaw for his share of the partnership was actually worthless. Black set up his own blacksmithy in competition with Shaw's and married Shaw's daughter in 1828 despite Shaw's objections and also convinced Shaw's son to join him in his business. Black was soon recognized as the best blacksmith in the area which had a bad effect on his father-in-law's competing shop. Black and his wife had three sons and a daughter during this period: William Jefferson in 1829, Grandison Deroyston in 1830, Sarah Jane in 1832, John Colbert in 1834, and Sydinham James in 1835. Black became a respected member of the community and served in local government posts. Entity:","completion":"James Black"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

According to Minnesota House of Representatives analyst Jim Cleary, \\"there appear to be at least two clearly distinguishable definitions of the term 'racial profiling': a narrow definition and a broad definition... Under the narrow definition, racial profiling occurs when a police officer stops, questions, arrests, and/or searches someone solely on the basis of the person's race or ethnicity... Under the broader definition, racial profiling occurs whenever police routinely use race as a factor that, along with an accumulation of other factors, causes an officer to react with suspicion and take action.\\" - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews.

How does photosynthesis compare to cellular respiration? Do those questions have the same meaning? Choose your answer from: -no. -yes.","completion":"Yes, the questions have the same meaning. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are vital processes for most organisms on Earth. Despite being seemingly opposite in nature, these two processes share a few similarities and many differences. Let's explore the similarities and differences between photosynthesis and cellular respiration in detail. Similarities: 1. Both involve the exchange of gases: In both processes, gases are involved as reactants and products. Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide and releases oxygen. In contrast, cellular respiration consumes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. 2. Biochemical pathways: Both processes involve complex biochemical pathways. Photosynthesis mainly consists of light-dependent reactions (where energy from sunlight is captured) and the Calvin cycle (the synthesis of organic molecules). Cellular respiration includes glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain, all of which break down organic molecules to release energy. 3. Role of ATP: Both processes involve the production or consumption of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of cells. Photosynthesis generates ATP to store energy in glucose molecules. In cellular respiration, breaking down glucose releases stored energy in the form of ATP. 4. Presence of electron transport chain: Both photosynthesis and cellular respiration involve an electron transport chain, a series of protein complexes within a membrane. This chain facilitates the transfer of electrons, enabling the conversion of sunlight or energy stored in glucose into ATP. Differences: 1. Location in the cell: Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, organelles found in plant cells containing chlorophyll pigments. Cellular respiration takes place in the mitochondria of almost all eukaryotic organisms (plants, animals, fungi, and protists). 2. Energy source: Photosynthesis is an anabolic process that uses sunlight as the primary energy source to combine carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose and oxygen. Cellular respiration is a catabolic process that breaks down glucose using oxygen, releasing energy in the form of ATP, water, and carbon dioxide. 3. Energy conversion: Photosynthesis is an endergonic process that stores energy in glucose molecules, while cellular respiration is an exergonic process that releases energy from glucose molecules. 4. Necessity of sunlight: Photosynthesis requires sunlight as the primary energy source. In contrast, cellular respiration can occur in the presence or absence of light, as long as glucose and oxygen are available. 5. Types of organisms: Photosynthesis occurs only in photoautotrophic organisms like plants, algae, and some bacteria, which can synthesize their own food. Cellular respiration occurs in nearly all living organisms, including autotrophs that produce their own food and heterotrophs that consume other organisms for energy. In summary, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two essential physiological processes with many similarities and differences. Both involve exchanging gases, biochemical pathways, and the use of ATP. They also both utilize electron transport chains in their processes. However, they differ in their location, energy source, energy conversion processes, dependence on sunlight, and the types of organisms in which they occur."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Chapter One: Grief[edit] The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her. Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)[edit] During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-disemboweling fox that tells him, \\"chaos reigns.\\" Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)[edit] In the dark attic the man finds the womanâs thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible.

Firstly, the reviewer has mentioned that they have experience with therm-a-rest products for years and have found them to be excellent. This indicates that the reviewer might have a good understanding of the brand's quality and expected performance. However, their experience with the specific product under review is negative. They state that the pillow offers \\"no support or cushioning,\\" which is a significant concern for a customer in need of a supportive, comfortable pillow. Comfort is a vital consideration when purchasing a pillow, as a substandard product may affect sleep quality or lead to discomfort. Additionally, the reviewer mentions that they will send the product back, which also suggests a lack of satisfaction and that the product failed to meet their expectations. If potential buyers have similar needs and preferences, this review might warn them of potential issues they could face, making them reconsider their purchase.

George's sheriff's officials accused in theft from union A grand jury charged two Prince George's County sheriff's officials Thursday with conspiring to steal more than 20,000 from the deputies' union when they were officers for the organization. The criminal indictment was brought by State Prosecutor Robert A. Rohrbaugh. According to the indictment, Wendy Tyler, who until Thursday was an acting sheriff's captain, served as president of the union that represents deputies from September 2005 to October 2007. Capt. Nancy Ridgely was first vice president of the union for the same term, the indictment says. During those two years, Tyler was entitled to receive quarterly checks totaling 10,400 from the Prince George's County Deputy Sheriff's Association, Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #112, the indictment says. Tyler instead received 13 union checks for 22,124, the indictment says. The union requires the signature of two officers to draw checks on the union's bank account, according to the indictment. Ridgely signed 12 of the 13 checks paid to Tyler, the indictment says. Ridgely, who supervises the sheriff's department's public information office, did not return a phone call. Tyler, who had been working as an acting captain in the department's domestic violence unit, also did not return a phone call. William C. Brennan, Ridgely's attorney, said, \\"My client adamantly denies these allegations and will vigorously contest these charges.\\" Sheriff Michael Jackson, a candidate in the Democratic primary for county executive, did not return phone calls. Col. Paul A. Drula, Jackson's second-in-command, said, \\"As we've said before, it's a union issue involving union funds, not government funds. It's between union members.\\" Tyler and Ridgely will be placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the charges, Drula said. During her leave, Tyler will revert to the rank of lieutenant, Drula said. The indictment also accuses Tyler of making purchases of more than 10,000 for nonunion purposes with her union-issued credit card. The bills for those personal purchases were paid for with union funds, the indictment says.","completion":"Two sheriff's officials in Prince George's County were accused of stealing over 20,000 from the deputies' union.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Bill de Blasio leads Democratic primary vote tally for NYC mayor, but Bill Thompson still threatens runoff; Joe Lhota wins GOP primary Bill de Blasio, the city’s 6-foot-5-inch public advocate, claimed a towering victory Tuesday in the Democratic race for mayor — but former Controller Bill Thompson refused to give up until “every vote” is counted. With 98% of the precincts reporting, it could not clear early Wednesday whether de Blasio had won the Democratic nomination — or whether Thompson had corraled just enough support to force a runoff in three weeks. And it could be a week or even more before the final vote count is decided. The latest tally showed de Blasio had 40.2% of the vote, just a whisker more than the 40% needed to win the nomination without a runoff. Thompson had 26%. But with tens of thousands of votes outstanding — including 19,000 paper ballots — it appeared that it would take the city’s embattled Board of Elections days, if not a week, to sort it all out. Introduced by his 16-year-old son, Dante, and 19-year-old daughter, Chiara, who had been showcased throughout his campaign, de Blasio took the stage at his raucous victory party at the Bell House in Gowanus, Brooklyn, as if the Democratic nomination had been settled. RELATED: LIVE BLOG! NEW YORK PRIMARY ELECTION DAY “We are better as a city when we make sure that everyone has a shot,” he said, reprising his campiagn mantra of bringing the income gap in New York. “We begin tonight.” But Thompson was far from ready to concede. “Every voice in New York City deserves to be heard,” the former city controller declared. “We’re going to wait for every vote to be counted,” he said. “This is far from over!” And with that, his supporters at the Eventi Hotel in Chelsea broke into chants of “Three more weeks! Three more weeks!” PHOTOS: NEW YORK CITY PRIMARY DAY 2013: CANDIDATES CAST THEIR BALLOTS A runoff, if necessary, would be held Oct. 1. “I’m confident,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-Queens), a Thompson backer. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn had 15.5%, Controller John Liu had 7% and scandal-scarred former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner had 4.9% — all finishing far out of the money. Whoever becomes the Democratic nominee will face Republican Joe Lhota in November for the right to lead the city after 12 years of Mayor Bloomberg’s reign. Lhota, a former MTA chairman and deputy mayor under Rudy Giuliani, outdistanced billionaire John Catsimatidis Tuesday for the Republican nomination. RELATED: ELECTIONS BOARD COULD TAKE WEEK BEFORE DETERMINING NEED FOR RUNOFF In the Democratic primary for city controller, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer defeated Eliot Spitzer, who was attempting a political comeback after resigning as governor in 2008 amid a prostitution scandal. There also were primaries Tuesday to determine the nominees for other citywide offices, borough presidencies and dozens of City Council races. But the battle to carry the Democratic banner in the November election took center stage Tuesday, as it has all year. The tallest man on the campaign trail, de Blasio exuded confidence as city residents headed to the polls. Grinning from ear to ear, the 52-year-old de Blasio soaked up the love from a cheering crowd as he and his wife, Chirlane McCray, cast their ballots at the Park Slope public library. RELATED: DE BLASIO SEEKS DECISIVE WIN IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY He even felt comfortable enough to park his not-so-secret weapon, Dante, at school, instead of trotting him out on one last bid for votes. The de Blasio campaign caught fire after the candidate made Dante and his fabulous Afro a focal point of his underdog campaign. De Blasio kept up his anti-Bloomberg rhetoric to the end, saying he represents a clear change in direction for the city from a mayor who is “out of touch with the people’s wishes.” “I present the most progressive view for this city, and I think the choice is clear in the Democratic primary,” de Blasio told cheering supporters. “He is going to win,” said voter Paulette White, 47. “Everyone in Park Slope is voting for you, Bill.” RELATED: DANTE DE BLASIO'S CLASSMATES IGNORE HIS LOCAL CELEB STATUS By the time the polls closed at 9 p.m., the Edison Research exit poll showed de Blasio in the lead. While de Blasio was coasting, Thompson scrambled to avoid another bitter disappointment, after coming surprisingly close to unseating Bloomberg in the last mayoral race four years ago. The only African-American candidate, Thompson completed a marathon 24-hour campaign blitz, battling to keep black voters from defecting to de Blasio, who is white. After stumping through the night, and voting in the morning, he took a nap, and hit the trail again. “I got a few hours of sleep, I feel good,” the 60-year-old Thompson said as he pressed the flesh in Flatbush, Brooklyn. “I’m hearing some very good things about turnout.” RELATED: BRONX CAMPAIGNERS DIDN'T GO 'ROUND HUNGRY Once a long shot to win the Democratic primary, de Blasio languished in fourth place for much of the year, with barely 10% of the vote. But he began to make his move in late July when Weiner’s candidacy imploded amid another sexting scandal and voters began hunting for an alternative. Then de Blasio cut the TV ads featuring his interracial family that turned his telegenic son into an unlikely star. De Blasio got enthusiastic receptions wherever he roamed Tuesday in a final push to get out the vote. Despite all the hoopla surrounding a 10-month campaign that featured 150 forums and more than 15 million in television advertising, turnout appeared to be spotty across the city — somewhere around 21% in the Democratic primary for mayor. The results represented a disappointing end for Liu, whose candidacy was upended by a fund-raising scandal. And the results likely ended the once-promising political career of Weiner. With Greg B.

After primary loss, Tea Party stirs Georgia GOP runoff May 20, 2014: Georgia Republican Senate candidate Jack Kingston and his wife Libby arrive for an election-night watch party in Atlanta.AP When Rep. Jack Kingston and former Dollar General CEO David Perdue advanced to a Republican runoff in Georgia's Senate race, the Tea Party was left without a favored candidate. Yet the state's sizeable Tea Party crowd isn't staying on the sidelines. Tea Partyers now appear to be rallying behind Kingston, an 11-term congressman from Savannah who has the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a history of supporting federal projects in his district. It's the pragmatic side of the Tea Party and says as much about the movement as it does about Kingston, whose voting record has been very conservative in recent years. \\"We're more concerned with people's attitudes since the rise of the Tea Party,\\" said Sal Russo, chief strategist of the Tea Party Express, one of the largest Tea Party groups in the country. His group has yet to endorse in the July 22 Georgia runoff. The Georgia race is one of at least two instances in which the national business group and the Tea Party are finding common ground. The chamber and Russo's group also have backed Republican Rep. Steve Daines in his bid for a Senate seat in Montana, a key pickup opportunity for the GOP. Nationally, Republicans are pushing for a net gain of six seats to claim a majority in the Senate and can't afford to lose the Georgia seat. Democrats have rallied behind Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn, and see her as one of their best chances to thwart GOP ambitions. The Tea Party hasn't fared that well in early primaries this year, although those were largely uphill races against well-funded Republican incumbents. And victories earlier this month by Tea Party-backed candidates in Nebraska and West Virginia Republican primaries are helping to reinvigorate the movement, which some had written off amid a difficult campaign season. In Nebraska, the primary victory by Republican Senate candidate Ben Sasse should help his party in November retain the open seat -- he is immediately considered the favorite for the seat held by retiring GOP Sen. Mike Johanns. In West Virginia, former Maryland GOP chairman Alex Mooney won the Republican primary with spending help from such outside groups as the Madison Fund, the Senate Conservatives Fund and Tea Party Express. The Georgia race was a free-for-all and pitted three congressmen against Perdue and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel. Handel and Rep. Paul Broun of Athens drew the most Tea Party support, with Handel carrying the endorsement of Tea Party favorite Sarah Palin and the Tea Party Express. Handel finished a close third, while Broun trailed in fifth. In recent years, Kingston has moved steadily to the right with votes against raising the debt ceiling and a bipartisan budget bill. While campaigning, he points to a record of cutting spending as a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Perdue's outsider message, of running against Washington and career politicians, would seem an easier sell with Tea Party activists seeking candidates willing to take on the establishment. But some of the first-time candidate's comments during the campaign may have set off alarms, and he faced sustained criticism as the front-runner in the final weeks before the primary. He won with 31 percent of the vote to Kingston's 26 percent. In one instance, Perdue argued he didn't mean raising taxes when he said both spending cuts and increased revenue would be needed to deal with the nation's debt. Perdue said he was talking about efforts to grow the economy, but his original comment prompted the conservative group FreedomWorks for America to declare: \\"Elect a Conservative, Not Perdue.\\" Handel on Wednesday backed Kingston and urged her nearly 133,000 supporters in the primary to do the same. One of Handel's chief supporters, Julianne Thompson with the Atlanta Tea Party, also endorsed Kingston. Perdue's campaign said the fact a few high-profile Tea Party activists are supporting Kingston doesn't mean rank-and-file members will fall in line. The Associated Press contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. Tea Party supporters in Georgia are rallying behind Republican Senate candidate Jack Kingston, an 11-term congressman, after their favored candidates were eliminated in the primary loss. 2. This move demonstrates the pragmatic side of the Tea Party, as Kingston is also backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and has a history of supporting federal projects in his district. 3. Republicans need a net gain of six seats to claim a majority in the Senate, and cannot afford to lose the Georgia seat. Democrats are rallying behind Michelle Nunn as their candidate. 4. Although the Tea Party didn't perform well in early primaries, recent victories in Nebraska and West Virginia have helped reinvigorate the movement. 5. Kingston's conservative voting record in recent years and focus on cutting spending may have attracted Tea Party support. On the other hand, some comments by rival candidate David Perdue may have alienated them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: As is the case with the two preceding 'Smokey and the Bandit' films, Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 begins with Big Enos (Pat McCormick) and Little Enos (Paul Williams) offering a sizeable wager on one's ability to transport a shipment a large distance in a short period of time. Offering a slight twist, however, the offer is this time made to a retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), betting 250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from an eatery in Florida to Texas.Unlike the two earlier films, Big and Little Enos this time seem to be quite active in their desire to see Buford fail in his goal. After Buford dodges their many traps (especially after he destroyed their milk truck, which drenched them and disabled their engine), they then go so far as to actually attempt to hire the Bandit (as a distraction) to stop him. Deciding that the Bandit is too egotistical and hard to manage, they hire Cledus \\"Snowman\\" Snow (Jerry Reed) as his replacement. Accepting the offer, Cledus parks his Peterbilt 359 and climbs behind the wheel of a black and gold 1983 Pontiac Trans Am.He later picks up Dusty (Colleen Camp), who quits her job as a \\"bookkeeper\\" for a used car dealership, but not before attempting to wreck her boss' business (a seedy used car dealership) by badmouthing him in the middle of broadcasting a live TV commercial.The scene of Cledus picking up Dusty in the middle of the road is almost an exact repeat of how Bo picked up Frog in the 1977 film. Cledus manages to catch up with Buford on an interstate, where he then lassoes Buford's fish off of the Justices' police cruiser; Buford needs the fish to retrieve his 250,000. Buford then begins a hot pursuit of Cledus, with another local officer who attempts to take charge of the situation. Not long after the local officer is disabled, Buford becomes disabled as well when sand is dumped on his squad car.The pursuit quickly resumes as Buford catches up to the duo after Cledus and Dusty stop at a redneck bar to pick up... The answer is:","completion":"In the movie 'Smokey and the Bandit Part 3', various key plot elements set the stage for an intriguing and high-stakes comedy chase. Given this detailed account of the movie plot, a potential question for discussion could be: \\"How does the dynamic between Big and Little Enos and Sheriff Buford T. Justice evolve throughout 'Smokey and the Bandit Part 3'? Despite Big and Little Enos' active involvement in trying to thwart Justice's quest, how do unexpected alliances and characters such as Cledus 'Snowman' Snow and Dusty add complexity to the plot? Discuss how their introductions play into the unfolding action and humor of the storyline. Also, consider the significance of Sheriff Justice's badge bet and the large stuffed fish in the broader context of the overall film plot.\\" Alternatively, another question could be: \\"Analyze the role and impact of Cledus 'Snowman' Snow as a replacement for the Bandit in changing the dynamics of 'Smokey and the Bandit Part 3'. How does his character and interaction with Dusty and Justice ignite the central conflict? Comment on the meaning and effect of the repeated scene of Snowman picking up Dusty, paralleling how Bo picked up Frog in the 1977 film.\\" One more question could be: \\"How are satirical elements used in 'Smokey and the Bandit Part 3' to amplify the humor and tension in the film? Consider the scene where Dusty badmouths her boss on live TV or the numerous times Justice dodges the traps set by Big and Little Enos. Additionally, talk about the implications, comic elements, and motivations behind the transport of the large stuffed fish.\\" The different facets of the plot, including the wager placed on Sheriff Buford T. Justice's ability, the introduction of new characters, and the various humorous instances present an excellent opportunity for in-depth discussion and analysis of the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The founding members were New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits Context: Crowded House were midway through a US tour when Paul Hester quit the band on 15 April 1994. He flew home to Melbourne to await the birth of his first child and indicated that he required more time with his family. Wally Ingram, drummer for support act Sheryl Crow, temporarily filled in until a replacement, Peter Jones (ex-Harem Scarem, Vince Jones, Kate Ceberano's Septet) was found. After the tour, the Finn Brothers released their album Finn in November 1995. In June 1996, at a press conference to announce the release of their greatest hits album Recurring Dream, Neil revealed that Crowded House were to disband. The June 1996 concerts in Europe and Canada were to be their final performances. Recurring Dream contained four songs from each of the band's studio albums, along with three new songs. The album debuted at number one in Australia, New Zealand and the UK in July 1996. Early copies included a bonus CD of live material. The album's three new songs, which were released as singles, were \\"Instinct\\", \\"Not the Girl You Think You Are\\" and \\"Everything Is Good for You\\", which featured backing vocals from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. Paul Hester returned to the band to play drums on the three new tracks. Worried that their goodbye had been too low-key and had disregarded their home fans, the band performed the Farewell to the World concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House on 24 November 1996, which raised funds for the Sydney Children's Hospital. The concert featured the line-up of Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, Mark Hart and Paul Hester. Tim Finn and Peter Jones both made guest appearances. Support bands on the day were Custard, Powderfinger and You Am I. The concert had one of the highest live audiences in Australian history with the crowd being estimated at between 120,000 and 250,000 people. Farewell to the World was released on VHS in December 1996. In 2007, a double CD and a DVD were issued as to commemorate the concert's tenth anniversary. The DVD featured newly recorded audio commentary by Finn, Hart and Seymour and other new bonus material. Question: Why did Paul decide to quit?.

He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined. and a hint : Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] Please answer this question : Which location's biodiversity loss likely to be permanent, location C or location D? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided and the definitions of biodiversity loss, it is more likely that location D's biodiversity loss will be permanent. There are several reasons for this conclusion. First, let's discuss the nature of biodiversity loss at each of the locations: 1. Location A: The loss of biodiversity is temporary, indicating that the environmental degradation at this location is reversible through ecological restoration or ecological resilience. This means that the species that have disappeared from this habitat can eventually return or re-establish themselves in the area. 2. Location B: The loss of biodiversity is permanent, meaning that the environmental degradation that has occurred at this location cannot be reversed. The species that have disappeared from this habitat are unlikely to return or re-establish themselves in the area. 3. Location C: The loss of biodiversity has yet to be determined, which means that we do not currently have enough information to assess whether the environmental degradation is reversible or not at this location. 4. Location D (entire globe): Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible, and the global loss of species is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition. Now, when comparing location C and location D, we must consider that the global loss of biodiversity is an irreversible process. While we do not have enough information about location C to know whether its environmental degradation is reversible, we do know that global extinction, as in location D, is irreversible. Additionally, the global loss of biodiversity poses an immediate danger to food security and ecosystem services not just for a specific region, but for all of humanity. This makes location D's biodiversity loss more significant, with far-reaching consequences. Taking all these factors into account, it is more likely that location D's biodiversity loss will be permanent in comparison to location C. However, it is crucial that additional research and examination be conducted within location C, to better understand the specifics of its biodiversity loss and work toward possible restoration or mitigation measures if necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists, who have since been drawn away by Citi Bikes. However, Ben said the bike-share is good for bike sales at his shop. \\"People have used the bike-share and realized how great it is to bike in the city, then decide that they want something nicer for themselves,\\" he noted. Christian Farrell of Waterfront Bicycle Shop, on West St. said at first he was concerned about bike-share, though, he admitted, \\"I was happy to see people on bikes.\\" Farrell's early concerns were repeated by Andrew Crooks, owner of NYC Velo, at 64 Second Ave. \\"It seemed like a great idea, but one that would be difficult to put into use:' Crooks said of Citi Bike. He said he worried about inexperienced riders' lack of awareness of biking rules and strong negative reaction from non-cyclists. However, he said, it's still too early to tell if his business has been impacted . While it's possible bike-share will cause a drop in business, Crooks agreed that the idea is a positive step forward for New York City. Question: What is the author's chief concern about the increasing use of Citi Bikes in New York? - Whether local bike shops will suffer. - How non-cyclists will respond to it. - Whether local bike businesses will oppose it. - How the safety of bike riders can be ensured. Answer:","completion":"The author's chief concern about the increasing use of Citi Bikes in New York is whether local bike shops will suffer."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Detailed Instructions: Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Q: I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK A:","completion":"Part #1: Sequence of actions Usage: I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK This sequence of actions is the input given. It meets the criteria because it is a sequence of valid actions that need to be converted into a command. Part #2: Commands align with actions Usage: I_LOOK -> 'look' In this example, the action I_LOOK is aligned with the command 'look'. It meets the criteria because it shows the relationship between an action and its corresponding command. Part #3: Denoting direction using 'left' and 'right' Usage: I_TURN_LEFT -> 'turn left' Here, the action I_TURN_LEFT is aligned with the command 'turn left'. It meets the criteria because it shows an action being converted into a command that includes the direction in which the action is performed. Part #4: Executing actions while turning around Usage: I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK -> 'walk around right' This example demonstrates the usage of the word 'around'. The given sequence of actions, when executed, results in the command 'walk around right', which makes the agent walk while turning around right. Part #5: Executing commands using 'and' Usage: I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK -> 'turn left and look' This example demonstrates the usage of the word 'and'. The given sequence of actions, when executed, results in the command 'turn left and look', which makes the agent execute the turn-left action and then the look action. Part #6: Executing commands using 'after' Usage: I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK -> 'turn right and look after turn left' This example demonstrates the usage of the word 'after'. The given sequence of actions, when executed, results in the command 'turn right and look after turn left', which tells the agent to execute the turn-right action and look action only after executing the turn-left action. Part #7: Triggering command repetition using 'twice' and 'thrice' Usage: I_JUMP I_JUMP -> 'jump twice' This example demonstrates the usage of the word 'twice'. The given sequence of actions, when executed, results in the command 'jump twice', which tells the agent to execute the jump action two times in a row."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They swim circles around him as he pours magic potions into the water.

She rests on top of one, domed by another, as they float towards the surface and far from her home.When she wakes up, she finds herself in the harbor of a seaside town, Tomonoura. When a large bottom trawler comes towards her, the goldfish swims away from the jellyfish in an attempt to escape but is quickly pulled into the mess of garbage and debris that the trawler picks up in its net. She becomes trapped within a glass jar but manages to escape the net and make it towards shallow water. Meanwhile, a young boy named Sosuke (English: Frankie Jonas Japanese: Hiroki Doi) runs down the hillside path from his home to the water's edge to play with his toy boat.

Build a movie plot around this: who is the owner of the home Gloria The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: \\"Gloria's Revelation\\" Genre: Mystery, Drama, Suspense Plot Summary: In a quaint yet charming suburban neighborhood, lies a sprawling Victorian mansion shrouded in secrecy and surrounded by beautifully manicured gardens. The locals have given the mansion a nickname, \\"Gloria's Home.\\" Strange occurrences have been happening for several decades, but nobody seems to have met the owner, Gloria. As the mysterious events unfold, intertwined lives of the neighborhood unravel, secrets are unveiled, and the shocking truth about Gloria's home and the elusive owner is ultimately revealed. Act 1: The story starts by introducing the main character, Sarah, a young freelance journalist, who has recently moved to the town to escape her troubled past while recovering from a failed relationship. Sarah quickly becomes intrigued by the neighborhood gossip surrounding Gloria's Home. After witnessing peculiar events around the mansion, she decides to pitch an investigative story to her editor about the mysterious house and its owner. Sarah begins to collect testimonies about the strange occurrences within the neighborhood, including unusual noises, misplaced items, suspicious shadows, and the unexplained disappearance of pets. She also learns about the decades-long whispers that involve similarly odd events occurring in the mansion. As her investigation deepens, she uncovers a myth suggesting Gloria's Home as the potential epicenter of the town's bizarre encounters. Act 2: Eager to get to the bottom of this mystery, Sarah conducts archival research in the local library. She discovers that Gloria was a wealthy heiress who moved into the mansion in the 1920s. As her research continues, she stumbles upon the town's dark secret: years ago, a tragic accident occurred at a factory owned by Gloria's family, leading to the loss of many lives. Gloria disappeared from the public eye shortly after and was rumored to be grieving in private over the accident. With this newfound knowledge, Sarah decides to seek entry to Gloria's Home. One night, she sneaks into the mansion under the cover of darkness. Inside the dimly lit house, Sarah finds herself in a labyrinth of rooms, showcasing an exquisite blend of antiques and modern artistry. She begins to feel an eerie presence, which grows stronger as she explores deeper. Act 3: While navigating her way through the mansion, Sarah stumbles upon a hidden room. The room contains pictures and personal items belonging to the victims of the factory accident. As she further investigates, Sarah discovers evidence that suggests Gloria had been providing financial support to the victims' families for decades without their knowledge. In a shocking twist, Sarah learns that Gloria has passed away, leaving the mansion in control of her granddaughter, Amelia. Amelia, who has been living in the town under an alias and is now the mysterious \\"owner\\" of Gloria's Home, has continued her grandmother's secret philanthropy. Uncovering the true identity of Amelia and the real story behind Gloria's Home, Sarah is torn between revealing the truth and respecting the family's decades-long secret. Conclusion: Conflicted, Sarah decides to confront Amelia, who confesses everything and explains her desire to keep her family's legacy alive and support the community in any way possible. Moved by Amelia's story, Sarah makes a difficult choice to keep their secret while advocating for better conditions for those affected by the tragedy. The movie ends with Sarah writing an article about the town, focusing on rebuilding their spirits and lifting the cloud of mystery over Gloria's Home. Despite not revealing Amelia's identity, Sarah manages to promote unity, forgiveness, and progress in the community while honoring Gloria's memory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: We all present these glossy lives to the world; coffee cups presented to dewy sunrises, champagne in airport lounges, luxurious restaurants that cost more than they should and share the blue skies days of exploration. I’m as guilty as anyone. But, what about behind those scenes? Those days where the wind is so strong you can’t instastory for talking (I’m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer ‘er, not sure’. So I thought I’d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn’t be calling myself a travel blogger. And yes, these are all very much first world problems. 1. I hate photographs of myself. Ironic, no? Especially when one of the first rules of blogging is all about the cult of personality. I just don’t like them. I wish I did, but there are few times that I fancy a photo and even less when I like the result. 2. We nip into a MacDonalds at least once every trip. It has now become a tradition between nicer restaurants to nip in and order a Big Mac and fries at some point of our trip – but especially in Europe for some reason. Why do their MacDonalds meals taste better? 3. Pastels aren’t really my shade. Again, I wish I could be super girly, twirling in gossamer skirts painted in spring shades but I’m just not. My colour palette is decidedly autumnal/jewel hued and usually sticks to a scarf draped around my neck in a hopefully fashionable manner. And I’m totally ok with that. 4. I once travelled all the way to New Zealand and back (stopping in 3 countries enroute) without a lens cap on my brand new, fairly expensive camera. This is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be – and how careful I also am.

Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.

The meeting aims to address the simmering conflict caused by rebels unhappy with the government and their recent attacks that have led to increased instability in the region. The situation in the Central African Republic has worsened in the past month as rebel groups, dissatisfied with the government, have staged a series of attacks. These actions have not only heightened tensions between the warring factions, but have also left civilians feeling unsafe and vulnerable in their own country. In a desperate bid to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control, the government of the Central African Republic has appealed to the international community for help in staving off the rebel advances. The involvement of representatives from central Africa, the United States, and Japan in the current discussions signifies the global concern for the situation and the urgency required in resolving it. During the talks, diplomats are expected to explore possible solutions for restoring peace and stability in the region, as well as addressing the grievances raised by the rebels. This collaborative approach, bringing together nations from different parts of the world, underlines the need for collective action in the face of such regional crises. As the negotiations continue, maintaining the safety of civilians and preventing further escalation of the conflict will be a top priority for all parties involved. It is hoped that through this diplomatic intervention, a path can be paved towards a long-lasting resolution that addresses the underlying issues fueling the unrest in the Central African Republic.

Draw Inuyasha's bangs, and two long, pointy lumps of hair on each side of his head. After drawing the head shape and shoulder and chest area for Inuyasha, the most natural next step is to add details to the face and hair. In this step, begin by drawing the eyebrows, which should be mostly straight, with slight angles towards the center. The eyes should be almond-shaped and consistent with the anime style, meaning they should be quite large and expressive. Next, draw the nose, which should be simply represented by a small curved line. For the mouth, sketch a straight line with a small curve at one end to illustrate his characteristic smirk. The detailing of Inuyasha's face is essential as it will help give life to the character. Now, focus on Inuyasha's hair. Start by drawing his bangs, which should consist of numerous, irregular strands of hair that are a mix of short and long. These should cover a considerable portion of his face, falling around the eyes and eyebrows region. After that, move on to the two long, pointy clumps of hair on each side of his head. These clumps should start at the top of his head and extend down past his shoulders. The shape of these distinctive clumps represents his dog demon ears, which are a crucial aspect of his character design.

However, only around 23,000 engineers are graduating in the country each year, while India and China are producing eight and 20 times as many, respectively. The study also points out that the existing pool of STEM experts is stretched thin and aging rapidly, causing UK companies to recruit specialists from abroad. The report urges for the training of STEM experts through alternate routes, as the yearly requirement for graduates will not be met by newly graduating students alone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jean-Philippe Rameau (French: [Zafilip Ramo]; (1683-09-25)25 September 1683 - (1764-09-12)12 September 1764) was one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the 18th century. He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside Francois Couperin. Little is known about Rameau's early years, and it was not until the 1720s that he won fame as a major theorist of music with his Treatise on Harmony (1722) and also in the following years as a composer of masterpieces for the harpsichord, which circulated throughout Europe. Along with Francois Couperin, Rameau is one of the two masters of the French school of harpsichord music in the 18th century. Both composers made a decisive break with the style of the first generation of harpsichordists, who confined their compositions to the relatively fixed mould of the classical suite. This reached its apogee in the first decade of the 18th century with successive collections of pieces by Louis Marchand, Gaspard Le Roux, Louis-Nicolas Clerambault, Jean-Francois Dandrieu, Elisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre, Charles Dieupart, and Nicolas Siret. Rameau and Couperin have different styles. They seem not to have known one another (Couperin was one of the official court musicians while Rameau was still an unknown; fame would only come to him after Couperin's death). Rameau published his first book of harpsichord pieces in 1706 while Couperin (who was fifteen years his senior) waited until 1713 before publishing his first \\"ordres.\\" Rameau's music includes pieces in the pure tradition of the French suite: imitative (\\"Le rappel des oiseaux,\\" \\"La poule\\") and character (\\"Les tendres plaintes\\", \\"L'entretien des Muses\\") pieces and works of pure virtuosity that resemble Scarlatti (\\"Les tourbillons,\\" \\"Les trois mains\\") as well as pieces that reveal the experiments of a theorist and musical innovator (\\"L'Enharmonique\\", \\"Les Cyclopes\\"), which had a marked influence on Daquin, Royer, and Jacques Duphly. The suites are grouped in the traditional way, by key. Rameau's three collections appeared in 1706, 1724 and 1726 or 1727, respectively. After this, he only composed a single piece for the harpsichord: \\"La Dauphine\\" (1747). Other works, such as \\"Les petits marteaux,\\" have been doubtfully attributed to him. During his semiretirement in the years 1740 to 1744, he wrote the Pieces de clavecin en concert (1741), which some musicologists consider the pinnacle of French Baroque chamber music. Adopting a formula successfully employed by Mondonville a few years earlier, these pieces differ from trio sonatas in that the harpsichord is not simply there as basso continuo to accompany other instruments (the violin, flute or viol) playing the melody but has an equal part in the \\"concert\\" with them. Rameau also claimed that the pieces would be equally satisfying as solo harpsichord works--although this statement is far from convincing, since the composer took the trouble to transcribe five of them himself--those where the lack of other instruments would show the least. What were some of his pieces?","completion":"Jean-Philippe Rameau composed many beautiful pieces of music in his lifetime. Some of his famous pieces are: 1. \\"Le rappel des oiseaux\\" - This piece is inspired by bird sounds and is for the harpsichord. 2. \\"La poule\\" - A fun and lively piece, it imitates the sounds and movements of a chicken. 3. \\"Les tendres plaintes\\" - This piece is gentle and emotional, representing the tenderest of complaints. 4. \\"L'entretien des Muses\\" - A sweet and melodic piece that is like a conversation between the mythical Muses. 5. \\"Les tourbillons\\" - A fast and virtuosic piece, imitating whirlwinds. 6. \\"Les trois mains\\" - A challenging piece for the harpsichord, written as if played by three hands. 7. \\"L'Enharmonique\\" - A piece that shows Rameau's skills as a musical theorist and innovator. 8. \\"Les Cyclopes\\" - Inspired by the one-eyed mythological creatures, this piece is energetic and rhythmic. 9. \\"La Dauphine\\" - Composed in honor of the Dauphine (wife of the heir to the French throne), it is a beautiful and elegant piece. 10. \\"Les petits marteaux\\" - Though its attribution to Rameau is uncertain, this piece imitates the small hammer sounds found in some musical instruments. Additionally, Rameau wrote the \\"Pieces de clavecin en concert\\" (1741), which is considered one of the pinnacles of French Baroque chamber music. These compositions showcase the harpsichord as an equal partner with other instruments like violin, flute, and viol."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It differs from documentary television in that the focus tends to be on drama, personal conflict, and entertainment rather than educating viewers. The genre has various standard tropes, including \\"confessionals\\" (also called \\"talking heads\\" or \\"interview segments\\") used by cast members to express their thoughts, which often double as the shows' narration.

Although successful in Melbourne, \\"Neighbours\\" underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them.

The term coconut can refer to the whole coconut palm or the seed, or the fruit, which, botanically, is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling cocoanut is an archaic form of the word. The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word \\"coco\\" meaning \\"head\\" or \\"skull\\", from the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features. - A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur. - Coconut milk is the liquid that comes from the grated meat of a brown coconut . It should not be confused with coconut water . The color and rich taste of coconut milk can be attributed to the high oil content . Most of the fat is saturated fat . Coconut milk is a very popular food ingredient used in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Southern China , the Caribbean and north of South America . - Coconut water is the clear liquid inside young green coconuts (fruits of the coconut palm). In early development, it serves as a suspension for the endosperm of the coconut during the nuclear phase of development. As growth continues, the endosperm matures into its cellular phase and deposits into the rind of the coconut meat. - Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.

Deputy Chief Operating Officer James Murdoch faced aggressive questioning from British lawmakers over his handling and account of the company's phone-hacking scandal. While Mr. Murdoch in one instance altered details of earlier testimony, he again insisted that he didn't know until late last year the extent of illicit activities at the company's former News of the World tabloid. Enlarge Image Close Associated Press News Corp.'s James Murdoch, seen in a video image, said 'it is appalling' News of the World had an investigator follow lawyers for hacking victims. In his second appearance this year before a parliamentary committee probing hacking, Mr. Murdoch on Thursday deflected suggestions that he bungled the company's management of the scandal over the U.K. newspaper's illegal interception of voice-mail messages during the reporting process. The scandal has led to the resignation of senior News Corp. executives, the closure of the newspaper and more than a dozen arrests. Mr. Murdoch denied that he misled the committee in prior testimony in July and accused former News Corp. employees—News of the World editor Colin Myler and lawyer Tom Crone—of giving misleading testimony. In statements to the Guardian newspaper Thursday, Mr. Myler said his testimony had been \\"accurate and consistent.\\" Mr. Crone called Mr. Murdoch's testimony \\"disingenuous.\\" Mr. Murdoch conceded that News Corp.'s handling of the phone-hacking affair had been undermined by the company's inclination to reject legitimate criticism as persecution from rivals. It was \\"the tendency for a period of time to react to criticism or allegations as hostile or motivated commercially or politically,\\" Mr. Murdoch said. \\"What we didn't do, I think, necessarily, is reflect as dispassionately as we might have.\\" Web of Connections Learn more about who's who and how they're all connected in the scandal over allegations of voice-mail interceptions and corrupt payments to police. View Interactive More photos and interactive graphics One member of Parliament compared News Corp.'s U.K. newspaper unit to organized crime. \\"You must be the first mafia boss in history who was not aware that he was running a criminal enterprise,\\" said Tom Watson, a Labour politician and one of News Corp.'s harshest critics. Mr. Murdoch called the comment inappropriate and offensive. News Corp. owns The Wall Street Journal. In revisiting the details of his handling of the hacking scandal, Mr. Murdoch altered one aspect of his July testimony related to what he knew in 2008 about an email that prompted News Corp. to pay roughly £700,000, or about 1 million, in a settlement to a soccer-union official hacked by the News of the World. Mr. Murdoch authorized the payment in mid-2008. The email—containing transcripts of hacked voice mails—appeared to contradict News Corp.'s longstanding assertion that phone hacking at the tabloid had been isolated to one reporter jailed for the practice in 2007. The email mentioned the names of two other reporters on the tabloid's staff, including reporter Neville Thurlbeck. It is now known as the \\"for Neville\\" email. In July, testifying alongside his father, News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch was asked whether in 2008 he saw or was \\"made aware of the 'for Neville' email, the transcript of hacked voice-mail messages?\\" \\"No, I was not aware of that at the time,\\" he replied. That remark subsequently prompted Messrs. Myler and Crone to release a statement disputing Mr. Murdoch, saying they had informed him of the email. On Thursday, Mr. Murdoch said he had been made aware of the email but that it hadn't been shown to him and he hadn't been briefed on its significance. The email \\"was mentioned to me as evidence that was important with respect to it being a transcript of a voice-mail interception that proved that it was on behalf of the News of the World,\\" Mr. Murdoch said. But he clarified that it was mentioned to him only as a reason why the case should be settled and was never referred to as the \\"for Neville\\" email. \\"The suspicion that perhaps other individuals were involved at the News of the World was not described to me, and the email was not shown to me either,\\" Mr. Murdoch said. Mr. Murdoch has maintained that he became aware of broader problems at the tabloid only late last year, when new information surfaced in civil suits against the company. After the hearing Thursday, a News Corp. spokesman said: \\"Mr. Murdoch's testimony has been clear and consistent that he was told of sufficient evidence to justify settling the case but given no indication that further investigation was necessary.\\" Mr. Crone, the former News of the World lawyer, disputed that characterization. \\"The simple truth is that he was told by us in 2008 about the damning email and what it meant in terms of wider News of the World involvement,\\" Mr. Crone said in a statement to the Guardian newspaper. \\"It seems he now accepts he was told of the email, of the fact that it contained transcripts of voice-mail interceptions and that those interceptions were authorized by the News of the World.\\" The News of the World—which was Britain's most popular weekly before it was closed in July—is the subject of three criminal investigations in the U.K. Legislators on Thursday also questioned Mr. Murdoch about revelations that the tabloid hired a private investigator to follow two lawyers representing phone-hacking victims—surveillance that was commissioned while Mr. Murdoch was overseeing the paper. Mr. Murdoch said he wasn't aware at the time that the surveillance had been commissioned, but he apologized that it had happened. \\"I want to say for the record that it is appalling, and it's something the company should never condone,\\" he said. He said Mr. Crone and another News of the World employee had commissioned the surveillance. Mr. Crone didn't address the surveillance in his statement to the Guardian and didn't respond requests for comment for this article. In testimony in September, Mr. Crone denied ordering the surveillance. Mr. Murdoch didn't work at News Corp. when most of the phone hacking allegedly occurred. He joined the company in late 2007 to run its operations in Europe and Asia, leaving the chief executive post at British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC, a U.K. pay-television company partially owned by News Corp. When he joined News Corp., he took on oversight of the company's British newspapers.

During questioning by MPs, Labour's Tom Watson suggested its UK arm had adopted the \\"omerta\\" code of silence. Mr Murdoch said that was \\"offensive and not true\\" and said he was not made aware in 2008 that phone hacking went beyond one rogue reporter. He also said two former executives had given MPs \\"misleading\\" evidence. The clash with Mr Watson, who has pursued the company over the phone hacking scandal, came halfway through the two and a half hour session. 'Bound by secrecy' Mr Murdoch repeatedly told the committee he had not been made aware of details suggesting phone hacking went beyond Clive Goodman - the former News of the World royal reporter jailed in 2007 - when he authorised a large out-of-court settlement to footballers' union leader Gordon Taylor in June 2008. Mr Watson asked if he was familiar with the code of \\"omerta\\" - where people \\"bound together by secrecy\\" pursued their objectives \\"with no regard for the law\\" and suggested that was \\"an accurate description of News International in the UK\\". You must be the first mafia boss in history who didn't know he was running a criminal enterprise Tom Watson MP Mr Murdoch replied: \\"Absolutely not. I frankly think that is offensive and that's not true.\\" The MP said the company was facing a series of allegations around hacking and told him: \\"You must be the first mafia boss in history who didn't know he was running a criminal enterprise.\\" Mr Murdoch said that was \\"inappropriate\\" and said while it was a \\"matter of great regret\\" that \\"things went wrong\\" at the newspaper, when evidence had come to light \\"we acted... with great zeal and diligence to get to the bottom of issues to improve the processes to make sure they didn't happen again\\". The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson, in the hearing, reported that a fellow MP said \\"oh come on\\" when Mr Watson made his mafia claim, whilst others on the committee sighed or \\"tutted\\". Out-of-court settlement Earlier in the hearing Mr Murdoch said he had not been shown a copy of the \\"For Neville\\" email - assumed to refer to former NoW chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, which contained transcripts of voicemail messages revealing that Gordon Taylor's phone had been hacked - at a June 2008 meeting with legal manager Tom Crone. At that meeting he agreed to authorise an increase in the out-of-court offer to Mr Taylor. It was not shown to me at the time, nor was it described to me in those terms in any way James Murdoch He said he was given \\"sufficient information to authorise the increase of the settlement offer\\" but added: \\"The nature of the so-called 'For Neville' email... any wider spread or evidence or suspicion of wider spread of wrongdoing - none of these things were mentioned to me.\\" Mr Murdoch denied misleading the committee at a hearing in July, when he said he had not been aware of the email. Two former NoW executives - former editor Colin Myler and former legal manager Tom Crone - have said they \\"did inform\\" Mr Murdoch of it at the time but he told the committee on Thursday: \\"I believe their testimony was misleading.\\" MP Tom Watson said Neville Thurlbeck told him that Mr Crone had said he had shown the email to Mr Murdoch - something Mr Crone did not confirm when he gave evidence to the committee. Mr Murdoch replied: \\"I really can't say what Mr Crone or Mr Thurlbeck may have discussed but my recollection is very clear.\\" He was also asked whether he knew about a legal opinion given to the company by solicitors Farrer and Co in 2008 which stated there is \\"a powerful case that there is (or was) a culture of illegal information access used at NGN [News Group Newspapers] in order to produce stories for publication\\". Mr Murdoch told MPs on Tuesday: \\"It was not shown to me at the time, nor was it described to me in those terms in any way.\\" He said \\"clearly\\" some within the company knew about the legal advice and the \\"for Neville\\" email - but \\"none of those things were made available or discussed with me\\". In a statement on Thursday, Mr Thurlbeck said he had compiled a dossier in his defence which \\"cleared my name and incriminated others\\" and claimed it had been \\"suppressed\\" by the News of the World. Mr Thurlbeck is on police bail after being arrested on suspicion of unlawfully intercepting voicemail messages and has lodged a claim for unfair dismissal against News International. The Sun Mr Murdoch also said the recent arrest of a journalist on the Sun was a matter of \\"great concern\\" but said he had \\"no knowledge\\" of other News International papers being involved in phone hacking, aside from the News of the World He did not rule out having to close The Sun if it was proved to have been involved but said he did not want to prejudge the outcome of investigations: \\"I shouldn't rule any corporate reaction to behaviour of wrongdoing out. That will be a decision taken at the time.\\" He also apologised for The Sun's coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy, in which 96 Liverpool football fans died saying: \\"I am aware of the concerns and the hurt it caused and it is something we are very sorry for, and I am as well.\\" Mr Murdoch also said revelations that his company had used a private detective to spy on lawyers acting for phone hacking victims in 2010 was \\"appalling\\" and \\"unacceptable\\" and apologised to committee member Mr Watson, who had also been put under surveillance in the past. He also said the use of private investigators on his company's papers had since been \\"severely restricted\\". In July, the News of the World was shut down after it was found to have hacked into the voicemail messages of prominent people, including murdered teenager Milly Dowler. The Metropolitan Police estimate about 6,000 may have had their phones hacked since 2002. The row has put pressure on James Murdoch's position at News Corp - with nearly 35% of News Corporation investors voting against him being re-elected to the board last month. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"James Murdoch, who was the Deputy Chief Operating Officer of News Corp, faced questioning from British lawmakers about how he handled the company's phone-hacking scandal.

Sadly I don't remember the book anymore, but I do recall that I was captivated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This Film represents a typical German Production of low quality. It does not hold my attention - although the story itself is good, it is just badly adabted. At the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. Even the well known and liked German Actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle. However there's hope ...

The future scenes had a similar feel to Brazil in a lot of ways, and even the present scenes were often really visually compelling. But perhaps the most striking thing about it was that it featured two actors I normally don't much like, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both delivered amazing performances here. Pitt especially -- I'd seen one or two films before that made me realize he could in fact actually act (contrary to what I'd originally thought), but this one really outdid them.

When considering giving up temporary premises, such as rented office spaces or temporary commercial locations, it is essential to ensure that all financing details have been properly taken care of. This includes examining current financial commitments, future expenses, and overall financial stability of the business. First, evaluate the current financial obligations tied to the temporary premises. This will involve reviewing rental or lease agreements, existing contracts with suppliers, and any related insurance policies. It is essential to understand the terms and conditions associated with these agreements, including potential penalties for early termination or other breaches of contract. Next, consider the costs associated with moving out of the temporary premises and into a more permanent location. This may include expenses like hiring movers, purchasing or leasing new equipment, or renovating the new space to meet the needs of the business. At this stage, it is crucial to obtain accurate estimates of these costs and ensure that adequate funds are available to cover them. Furthermore, assess the overall financial stability of the business and its ability to generate the necessary funds for a smoother transition to a permanent location. This includes reviewing revenue projections, profit margins, and current cash flow. Be sure to take into account any seasonal fluctuations in revenue or other factors that may impact the business's financial status and create a contingency plan for these uncertainties. Finally, explore potential financing options to support this move. It may be helpful to consult with financial advisors, banks, or other lenders to discuss credit lines or loans, or to consider alternative funding methods like crowdfunding or angel investments. In summary, it is essential to be certain that the financial details are properly handled when giving up temporary premises and transitioning to a new, permanent location.

Choose from: (1). unacceptable; (2). acceptable;","completion":"(2). acceptable The given sentence - \\"I shaped the dough.\\" - is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's break it down to understand why: Syntactic acceptability evaluates whether a sentence is structured correctly according to the grammatical rules of a language. In this case, the sentence is structured correctly in English: 1. The subject of the sentence is \\"I,\\" which is a pronoun referring to the speaker. 2. The verb of the sentence is \\"shaped,\\" which is the past tense of the verb \\"to shape.\\" It is an appropriate verb to describe an action that took place in the past. 3. The object of the sentence is \\"the dough,\\" which is a noun phrase comprised of the definite article \\"the\\" followed by the noun \\"dough.\\" The object of the verb \\"shaped\\" refers to the thing that was shaped, which is \\"the dough\\" in this case. Overall, the sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order and adheres to the grammatical rules of English. Therefore, it is syntactically acceptable. Semantic acceptability evaluates whether a sentence makes sense and conveys a clear meaning. The sentence communicates a clear action: the speaker (I) molded or formed the dough into a particular shape. This action is commonly done while making bread, pastries, or other baked goods, and it is a logical statement in the context of food preparation. Thus, the sentence is semantically acceptable as it conveys a clear and coherent meaning. Combining both syntactic and semantic acceptability, the sentence \\"I shaped the dough.\\" is deemed acceptable in both aspects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: by: Sarah Bleau Updated: Jan 21, 2016 - 11:22 AM Day seven of the search for two-year-old Noah Chamberlin began at 1:19 p.m., seven days to the minute of when he was reported missing. It also began with seemingly hopeful news from Madison County Sheriff John Mehr. Related Headlines PHOTOS: Vigil held as search for Noah Chamberlin continues \\"We've got some leads that we have recovered and that's one reason…I'll just tell you that's one reason why we believe he's still there,” Sheriff Mehr said. >> PHOTOS: Vigil held as search for Noah Chamerlin continues Madison County Fire Chief Eric Turner said they have expanded their search grid to beyond 1,000 acres. He added they will take some of the equipment from the search to use for the upcoming potential winter weather. \\"We want to get it out of there before the weather comes in because, like the sheriff alluded to, if we have a bad snowstorm coming here we might need that equipment elsewhere,\\" said Turner. The Madison and Chester County sheriffs added search dogs came from Hunstville, Alabama Wednesday. Mehr explained the dogs have not and may not pick up a scent because two-year-old Noah is so small and not leaving enough of a scent. Chester County Sheriff Blair Weaver said they have new search crews combing through areas they have already searched, in an effort to get a fresh perspective. The same evening, nearly 200 people came together for a prayer vigil for Noah and his family. \\"What if you were in that place? How would you want to be treated and what would you want done? You would want somebody to pray and lift you up, you want somebody to respect privacy,\\" Pastor Andy Morris, who's known the family for six years, told the crowd. Morris said he met with the family just before the vigil. \\"They're still very hopeful, still very faithful, they believe Noah is going to be found,\\" Morris said. \\"This family is heartbroken, this family is searching day and night because they desire for their loved one to come back home.\\" Sheriff Weaver said earlier in the afternoon that the rumors about Noah's family - specifically citing those about his father's criminal history and his grandmother's relationship - need to stop. He said they've looked into the family and added they are good citizens. Weaver also said time spent investigating rumors and speculation is hindering more constructive search efforts. Noah went missing last Thursday afternoon while on a nature walk in the Chester County woods with his grandmother. He was added to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's website this week. ||||| As the search for 2-year-old Noah Chamberlin continues, a community is rallying around the search and praying he is found safe. As the search for 2-year-old Noah Chamberlin continues, a community is rallying around the search and praying he is found safe. Major developments in the search for missing 2-year-old to be announced at 4 p.m. Two-year-old Noah Chamberlin went missing January 14, but the search for him has not let up. Hundreds of law enforcement officials have remained relentless in the search and are swarming Chester County to find the missing boy. The toddler disappeared nearly a week ago while walking with his grandmother and sister in the woods near his home in Pinson, Tennessee, just 11 miles outside of Jackson. Chester County Sheriff Blair Weaver is still calling the search for Noah a search and rescue operation, despite seemingly deadly conditions in the woods Noah was lost in and the search being in its seventh day. Law enforcement officials said during a press conference Wednesday they have reason to believe Noah will be found. \\"We've got some leads we've recovered, and that's one reason we feel he's still there,\\" they said. Leaders would not elaborate on what type of leads or evidence they found. When pressed for how 'realistic' it is Noah will be found alive, investigators responded by saying they would not give up hope. \\"We still believe he is out there and evidently a lot of people do too, because they're coming to help us. We appreciate the support; we appreciate the help,\\" Weaver said. \\"We haven't stopped and we're not going to stop.\\" The Scale of the Search Weaver said they are expecting to scale back the search for Noah on Friday due to inclement weather. Currently, numerous resources and tools have been brought in to assist in the search for Noah, but many of those may be pulled out on Friday to help the county deal with winter weather. Search leaders said even if they have to scale back the amount of equipment being used, that will not signify an end in the search. They are adamant they will not quit searching for Noah. Officials searched throughout the night Tuesday and expanded the area from the 1,000 acres previously searched up through Tuesday. Volunteers The terrain is muddy and one man even flew to Tennessee from California to help officials search for Noah. Volunteers are anxious to get back out to search for Noah. However, officials are not allowing volunteers to return to the search due to the hazards of the weather. Volunteers could get injured if they search during this time. \\"They're doing everything in God's power to find this child,\\" search volunteer Gerald Parish said. \\"Everything that you can think of, they've thought of.\\" Parish has been out searching and has seen it firsthand. He said he's surprised they haven't found Noah, but at the same time, he admits the area he went missing in is vast and hard to search. Suspicions Arise Many people aren't as forgiving as Parish--some are getting suspicious about Noah's disappearance. TBI officials said they are still not doing an investigation and are only assisting in the search. Law enforcement said FBI and TBI have thoroughly vetted family members and have cleared the family. They do not believe the past history has anything to do with the missing child. Noah's father has been in trouble for narcotics in San Bernardino, California, but has no recorded problems in Tennessee. TBI said it can only investigate if a district attorney requests an investigation, which has not happened yet. A district attorney from a different county with zero ties to this case said state law prohibits the Chester County District Attorney from asking for a TBI investigation unless there is reasonable cause to suspect criminal activity. He said being unable to find Noah is not evidence of criminal activity. Additionally, Child Protective Services with the Department of Children's Services said they could not comment on if they have any past history with the family, but they did say they are not currently involved with the family at this time. \\"Sheriff Weaver is telling us that they [family] would prefer not to address the media at this time. Maybe they're waiting for a result,\\" Tom Mapes,Madison County Sheriff's Department, said. While frustration may be mounting for those following the search for Noah, others said every effort possible is being made to bring the little boy home. \\"They're doing everything humanly possible that they can do to find this child,\\" Parish said. Wednesday night prayer vigil for Noah The community came together Wednesday and instead of church services, they gathered for a prayer vigil in Noah's honor. One of the pastors said he would not be surprised if the entire gymnasium at Chester County High School is full of people wanting to pray for the toddler. It's been a tough seven days for the community. People have donated their time and money to help find Noah. Now, they're coming together through faith with an evening prayer vigil. All of them will be praying for a miraculous rescue that would bring Noah home. \\"Regardless of the outcome--trusting in God and trusting that he is in control, that he ultimately has control of Noah's life--that, I believe, is the main source for the comfort of prayer,\\" Pastor John Gaters of Pinson Baptist Church said. While people were praying, law enforcement were searching. At a time when many would be losing hope, the Chester County community is staying faithful to pray for a miracle. \\"The game plan remains the same. The goal is to find him,\\" Mapes said. Many gathered together at the school to pray for Noah and for a safe return and for answers. \\"I'll just be glad when they have answers,\\" Angela Harris said \\"I'm just grateful that the community we live in people come together, they'll help, come together and help,\\" Tim Roland said. The community is also rallying behind Sheriff Blair Weaver, who continues to search relentlessly for the toddler. Weaver said at some point, the search will need to be scaled back and that could begin after Wednesday night. Rough Terrain and Dropping Temperatures The dropping temperatures and rough terrain are making the search for little Noah even more difficult. \\"It is rough country. You could step off into the hole and not even know it's there,\\" Charles Wooley said. Wooley has spent all of his 70-plus years living in the area, and he said sinkholes are an easy way to break a leg. \\"Here's how they normally start: as the water runs, it can get deeper and deeper and deeper,\\" Wooley said. Sinkholes are all over Wooley's farm. He said the woods where Noah went missing has much rougher terrain than his, so navigating over the hills and gulleys and through the trees is tricky. Sometimes the holes are completely covered in grass. He said those woods would be tough to survive in, even for a trained adult. \\"If they dropped in there--and sometimes dirt and mud could fall on them--you'd never know he's there,\\" Wooley said. To make it more difficult, Wooley said it rained in the area Thursday night after Noah went missing. \\"If the soil in the hole underneath is soupy enough, or loose, they could keep on going,\\" Wooley said. That is why he believes thousands of people and dogs with all kinds of equipment have not found Noah in seven days of searching. He is worried it could end up being the reason they never do. \\"Losing a child has to be one of the most horrible things a parent could face,\\" Wooley said. \\"It's just a sad situation and you can't put it any other way.\\" Searchers have been using special cameras to look inside sinkholes for the past few days. But, there are so many of them, it could take a while to check every one. Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5.

I was prescribed Hydrocodone for the pain before the surgery but complained about not being able to sleep . So after the surgery my Dr. prescribed Oxycodone . What must have happened before the person required surgery ?","completion":"Before the person required surgery for their torn cartilage in the right knee, several events and factors might have contributed to the injury and the decision for surgical intervention. Here is a detailed account of possible events leading up to the surgery: 1. Initial Injury: The person may have experienced a traumatic event or participated in an activity that put stress on the knee joint, leading to the tear in the cartilage. This could involve sports, accidents, or a sudden twist or impact on the knee. Common sports that can cause knee injuries include soccer, basketball, skiing, and running. 2. Onset of Symptoms: After the initial injury, the person likely started experiencing symptoms such as pain, swelling, stiffness, and reduced range of motion in the affected knee. They might also have felt a locking or catching sensation when trying to move the joint. 3. Initial Consultation: The individual probably sought medical advice from a healthcare professional due to the persistent symptoms. The physician might have conducted a physical examination, assessed the knee's range of motion, and palpated the joint to identify any abnormalities. 4. Diagnostic Tests: To confirm the diagnosis of torn cartilage, the healthcare professional may have ordered additional imaging tests, such as an X-ray, MRI, or CT scan, to get a detailed view of the knee joint and surrounding structures. This would help determine the extent of the injury and rule out any other possible conditions. 5. Non-Surgical Treatment: In some cases, prior to deciding on surgery, the physician may have recommended conservative treatment options to manage the pain and inflammation, such as rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE), and over-the-counter pain medications. Additionally, the person might have been advised to use crutches, a knee brace, or participate in physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the knee joint and improve mobility. 6. Evaluation of Treatment Progress: After attempting non-surgical treatment options, the healthcare professional likely assessed the person's progress to determine if the symptoms had improved or if further intervention was required. This might include follow-up appointments, physical examinations, and additional imaging tests. 7. Decision for Surgery: If conservative treatment options failed to alleviate the symptoms or if the cartilage tear was severe, the healthcare professional might have determined that surgery was necessary to repair the damage and prevent further complications. This decision would have been based on factors such as the person's age, activity level, pain tolerance, and overall health. 8. Preoperative Appointment: Prior to surgery, the person would have had a preoperative consultation to discuss the surgical procedure, potential risks and complications, and necessary preparations. The physician may have also ordered preoperative tests, such as blood work, to ensure the individual was fit for surgery. In summary, the person likely experienced an injury that led to a tear in the cartilage of their right knee. They would have undergone several steps to diagnose the issue and attempt non-surgical treatments before ultimately requiring surgery. During this process, they were prescribed Hydrocodone for pain management but requested an alternative medication due to sleep-related side effects. Consequently, their doctor prescribed Oxycodone following the surgery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full birth name of the person who was declared the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time? Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

Thomas Dagget, a Catholic seminary student, loses his faith when he sees disturbing visions of a war between angels. Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon, enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Uziel, a lieutenant of the angel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Colonel Arnold Hawthorne and the theology thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds the dead veteran awaiting burial and sucks the evil soul out of the body.The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the Book of Revelation that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a \\"dark soul\\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon.Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death and keeps him in a state of limbo. Unhappily dominated by Gabriel, Jerry retrieves Uziel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Uziel's body in the morgue. After finding Hawthorne's obituary, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little Native American girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is taken care of by her teacher, Katherine.After finding Uziel's burnt body, all evidence of its oddity now lost, Thomas hurries to Chimney Rock. When Gabriel realizes Hawthorne's soul is missing, he confronts Simon. Gabriel says Hawthorne's soul will tip the balance to whichever side possesses it. Should the rebellious angels win, Heaven will become like Hell with earth in its thrall. Simon refuses to reveal its location, and Gabriel kills him, ripping out his heart. Mary shows signs of possession by the evil soul; she suddenly recounts an incident from Hawthorne's harrowing war experiences in first-person perspective. Meanwhile, Thomas examines Simon's remains and questions Katherine. In Hawthorne's home, he finds evidence of war crimes. Thomas visits a church to reflect and is shaken by a verbal confrontation with Gabriel. He is beginning to understand the nature of the jealous angels who hate humans because God loves them most.At school, Katherine finds Gabriel questioning the children. After he leaves, she rushes to Mary's home and finds Thomas there. As Mary's condition worsens, Katherine takes Thomas to an abandoned mine where she had seen Gabriel. Inside, they find angelic script and experience together a terrible vision of the angelic war. They rush back to Mary's home, only to find Gabriel and Jerry there. Thomas kills Jerry, who thanks him for the release. Katherine stops Gabriel temporarily when her wild gunshot misses him and blows up Mary's trailer home. The three protagonists flee to a Native American site where Mary can be exorcised. In a hospital ICU ward, Gabriel recruits a new unwilling assistant, Rachel, just as she dies of a terminal illness. He needs her because he doesn't know how to drive.That night, Lucifer confronts Katherine and tells her that \\"other angels\\" have taken up this war against mankind, and since then, no human souls have been able to enter Heaven. He knows of Gabriel's plot to use Hawthorne's soul to overthrow the obedient angels, and he knows that if Gabriel wins, under his influence Heaven will ultimately devolve into another Hell. That's unwanted competition. The next day, Lucifer appears to Thomas and advises him to use Gabriel's lack of faith against him. Gabriel arrives and attempts to disrupt the exorcism ritual. Thomas kills Rachel, and he and Katherine fight Gabriel.Lucifer appears first encouraging the tribe to complete the exorcism. Then he confronts Gabriel telling him that his war is based upon arrogance, which is evil, making it Lucifer's territory. Gabriel taunts Lucifer about his past when he fell from grace; Lucifer tells Gabriel he needs to go home and rips out his heart. Simultaneously Mary expels out Hawthorne's soul, a rancid cloud of evil. The \\"enemy ghost\\" starts to attack the people but a bright light from Heaven immediately destroys it. With the threat to his evil kingdom eliminated, Lucifer tells Thomas and Katherine to \\"come home\\" with him. They staunchly refuse. \\"I have my soul...and my faith,\\" declares Thomas.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- Robin Thicke's summertime hit \\"Blurred Lines\\" is an illegal rip-off of Marvin Gaye's \\"Got to Give It Up,\\" Gaye's children claim in court documents filed Wednesday. Fans, journalists and music experts immediately recognized similarities between Gaye's 1977 hit and the 2013's summertime smash, Gaye's heirs contend. The controversy is a high-stakes legal fight involving an alleged conflict of interest with Sony-ATV, the music publisher half-owned by Michael Jackson's estate. Gaye's heirs not only accuse Thicke and \\"Blurred Lines\\" co-writers Pharrell Williams and \\"T.I.\\" Clifford Harris Jr. of copying Gaye's song, but they also contend Sony-ATV failed to meet its responsibility to protect the copyright. The Gaye family contracted with Sony-ATV after the singer-songwriter's death to administer his music catalog, but it also represents","completion":"Thicke, Williams, and Harris Jr., leading to an inherent conflict of interest that the family believes has compromised the publisher's capacity to properly defend their father's intellectual property. The crux of the court case, therefore, revolves around whether \\"Blurred Lines\\" unlawfully borrowed key aspects from \\"Got to Give It Up\\" and whether Sony-ATV's handling of the matter with respect to their dual-sided clientele constitutes a significant breach of fiduciary duty. The implications of such a case are immense, reaching far beyond the involved parties and potentially affecting the entire music industry. As the copyright infringement allegations against Thicke, Williams, and Harris Jr. continue to surface, the intricacies of each claim draw considerable attention to the ongoing debate surrounding the originality in music, the potential line between inspiration and theft, and the responsibility of publishers in safeguarding the rights of their clients. The Gaye family's impassioned battle to preserve the legacy of their father's work is indicative of deeper tensions within the artistic community, where the line between acceptable borrowing of musical elements and plagiarism remains fraught with ambiguity. This highly publicized case has the potential to set a precedent for future copyright disputes, as it raises questions about the legal safeguards that should be implemented to prevent publishers from becoming caught in the middle of conflicting interests. In particular, the court proceedings may offer clarity on the potential consequences of dual representation by a single publishing house, emphasizing the need for more robust guidelines and transparent negotiations to ensure equal protection for all parties involved. Beyond the legal and financial implications, the impact of this case on the careers of Thicke, Williams, and Harris Jr., as well as the reputation of Michael Jackson's estate and Sony-ATV, is also notable. With intertwining interests and damages that could amount to millions of dollars, the outcome of this dispute will likely reverberate throughout the industry and may lead to further examination and potential reform of copyright laws and music publishing practices. As the case unfolds, it is clear that the Gaye family remains steadfast in their pursuit of justice in defense of their father's legacy. Embroiled in contentious legal battles and public scrutiny, the underlying message is that creative integrity and the preservation of artistic works are essential in an industry that thrives on the power of music.

Q: Passage: According to the Yuanshi, the Yuan fleet set out with an estimated 15,000 Mongol and Chinese soldiers and 1,600-8,000 Korean soldiers in 300 large vessels and 400-500 smaller craft along with several thousand sailors, although figures vary considerably depending on the source and many modern historians consider the numbers exaggerated. The primary port for the operation was Quanzhou in Fujian, then the center of China's maritime trade. They landed on Komodahama beach on Tsushima Island on October 5, 1274. Sō Sukekuni, governor of Tsushima, led a cavalry unit of 80 to defend the island, but he and his outnumbered unit were killed in the engagement. The Mongols and Koreans subsequently invaded Iki. Tairano Takakage, the Governor of Iki, fought the invaders with about 100 of his cavalrymen, but he killed himself after his unit was defeated. The Mongol forces landed on November 19 in Hakata Bay, a short distance from Dazaifu, the ancient administrative capital of Kyūshū. The following day brought the Battle of Bun'ei , also known as the \\"First Battle of Hakata Bay\\". The Japanese coalition force opposing them included 120 armed samurai each with a warband and likely numbered between 3,000 and 6,000 strong. Later accounts have both sides believing themselves to be drastically outnumbered by the enemy; the Yuanshi provides an estimate of 102,000 for the Japanese force, while the Japanese Hachiman Gudokun describes the invaders as outnumbering the Japanese 10 to 1. Conlan argues that the Yuanshi's account of the battle suggests that both the Japanese and Yuan forces were of similar size. Conlan estimated that both armies numbered around 3,000 each .

This is due to the supranational nature of community institutions, particularly the Commission and Parliament. In other words, the involvement of these European institutions is key to addressing certain issues within member countries without directly interfering with their internal politics. The Commission, Council, and Parliament all hold specific powers and responsibilities within the European Union, which enable them to ensure adherence to EU laws, policies, and standards. The European Commission, for instance, is responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, and overseeing the application of EU treaties. In this capacity, it can take action to address any violations or discrepancies among the member states. Similarly, the European Parliament serves as a democratic forum where members represent their respective citizens, ensuring that their interests are considered and acted upon. The Council of the European Union, on the other hand, represents the interests of EU member governments and works with the Parliament to coordinate policies, adopt legislation, and negotiate international agreements. In this role, it has the power to ensure that actions taken by member states align with EU guidelines and overarching objectives. By utilizing these supranational institutions, the European Union can address various issues within its member countries without directly intervening in their internal decision-making processes.

Carol has been visiting a psychoanalyst (George Rigaud) because of a string of disturbing dreams she's been having featuring her decadent neighbor, Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg). Julia's frequent, late-night parties infuriate and yet excite Carol, evoking images of wild sex-and-drug orgies. During a meeting between Edmund and Frank, they talk about their recent court cases in which Edmund asks Frank if he has been unfaithful to Carol, which Frank denies. Then a phone call is made by an anonymous woman who claims to Edmund that she has damaging information about his family. But unknown to everyone, Frank is indeed having an affair with his personal secretary Deborah whom he meets after work at her country house for some romantic tryst. Carol's dreams continue which become more complicated during scenes that appear to be dreams or hallucinations. Describing her latest one to her psychoanalyst, they depict a lesbian encounter between the two women, culminating in Carol grisly stabbing the seductive Julia to death. In an enigmatic coda to the dream sequence, Carol sees two kaftan-clad hippies (Mike Kennedy and Penny Brown) who have apparently witnessed the whole thing without intervening. The following day, it's revealed that Julia Durer has indeed been murdered. Inspector Corvin (Stanley Baker) from Scotland Yard arrives to take charge of the investigation.

Mass deaths at about 25 separate colonies have been reported since the weekend, including at Mt Ommaney, Redbank, Boonah, Palmwoods, Laidley and Gatton. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says the heatwave was a significant hit to the population of bats across the state. \\"The heatwave was basically a catastrophe for all the bat colonies in south-east Queensland,\\" he said. \\"That's obviously going to have a pretty disturbing impact on those colonies and those colonies are vital to our ecosystem.\\" The smell of bat carcasses has caused problems for locals. The Scenic Rim Regional Council, west of Brisbane, has organised rubbish collectors to clear up the carcasses of about 2,000 bats. Residents near Boonah's Athol Terrace lookout say they have been putting up with the stench of the dead animals for four days. Hundreds of bats also lie dead in trees and nearby bushes, and are being eaten by maggots. The council today advised local residents it will not send workers into nearby bushland to collect the remaining bat carcasses, as it could cause further disruption to the nearby colony. One resident has told the ABC she is receiving anti-viral treatment after being scratched by a baby bat while clearing the dead animals out of her tree with a rake. Further north, Lockyer Valley Regional Council says it also faces a massive task of cleaning up thousands of dead bats from around Laidley and Gatton. Sunshine Coast Regional Council has sent workers out to collect thousands more dead bats near Palmwoods. At least 16 people across south-east Queensland are receiving anti-viral treatment after coming into close contact with a bat. Queensland Health is advising people not to touch the animals and to call authorities for help in clearing them away. Sammy Ringer from Bat Rescue echoed those concerns, saying it was best to call a wildlife volunteer or a vet. \\"Don't touch them, they're stressed,\\" she said. \\"If they do bite or scratch you and break the skin you can get a vaccination, you can get a shot for the lyssavirus.\\" Topics: local-government, phenomena, environmental-impact, boonah-4310, southport-4215, maroochydore-4558 First posted ||||| Queensland heatwave: Brisbane set to roast as weekend temperatures soar Updated The scorching heatwave gripping much of Queensland is being felt in Brisbane today, with residents set to roast in temperatures of up to 41 degrees Celsius. At 9:25am, the mercury had already hit 35.1C, with the apparent temperature hovering at 37.4C, according to the Bureau of Meteorology website. By 1:00pm, the temperature had risen to 38C, although the apparent temperature was 41C. Queensland's interior has been sweltering through record-breaking heat in recent days, along with parts of Central Australia and north-western New South Wales. The heatwave continued as a Bureau of Meteorology report revealed 2013 was the hottest year on record in Australia. The mass of hot air causing the extreme weather again led to searing temperatures in central and western Queensland on Friday. St George topped the temperature list with 47.2C, while Winton and Longreach also had scorchers at 46.4C and 46.3C respectively. Charleville followed on 46.1C, while Blackall, Roma and Thargomindah all recorded temperatures just above 45C. Brisbane's top for Friday was 34.3C, but the mercury is predicted to reach 41C today as northerly winds push the heatwave south. Further evacuations not expected Firefighters are confident no further evacuations will be needed as they battle a large bushfire on Stradbroke Island. Firefighters are confident no further evacuations will be needed as they battle a large bushfire on Stradbroke Island. The Gold Coast's beaches have been packed with people keen to beat the heat, and that is sure to be the case over the weekend. Queenslanders have also been urged to put their health first during the current heatwave. Last summer, paramedics responded to more than 350 cases of heat-related illness across the state. Steven Clarke from Queensland Ambulance says drinking plenty of water is the key. Mr Clarke says families should ensure loved ones are coping with the heat, with the elderly particularly vulnerable. \\"For the elderly and people with chronic illnesses, especially with kidney problems, diabetic problems, obese people, they need to take extra care,\\" he said. \\"Probably a critical point to make is family need to check their loved ones - grandad and grandma living on their own - they need to ring them up, they need to go around and visit them and make sure they are doing the right thing.

Article: We've reached a strange--some would say unusual--point. While fighting world hunger continues to be the matter of vital importance according to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), more people now die from being overweight, or say, from being extremely fat, than from being underweight. It's the good life that's more likely to kill us these days. Worse, nearly l8 million children under the age of five around the world are estimated to be overweight. What's going on? We really don't have many excuses for our weight problems. The dangers of the problem have been drilled into us by public-health campaigns since 2001 and the message is getting through--up to a point. In the 1970s, Finland, for example, had the highest rate of heart disease in the world and being overweight was its main cause. Not any more. A public-health campaign has greatly reduced the number of heart disease deaths by 80 per cent over the past three decades. Maybe that explains why the percentage of people in Finland taking diet pills doubled between 2001 and 2005, and doctors even offer surgery of removing fat inside and change the shape of the body. That has become a sort of fashion. No wonder it ranks as the world's most body-conscious country. We know what we should be doing to lose weight--but actually doing it is another matter. By far the most popular excuse is not taking enough exercise. More than half of us admit we lack willpower. Others blame good food. They say: it's just too inviting and it makes them overeat. Still others lay the blame on the Americans, complaining that pounds have piled on thanks to eating too much American-style fast food. Some also blame their parents--their genes. But unfortunately, the parents are wronged because they're normal in shape, or rather slim. It's a similar story around the world, although people are relatively unlikely to have tried to lose weight. Parents are eager to see their kids shape up. Do as I say--not as I do.

Charles Michael \\"Chuck\\" Schuldiner (May 13, 1967 - December 13, 2001) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He founded the pioneering band Death in 1983. Schuldiner is often referred to as \\"The Godfather of death metal\\", and his obituary in the January 5, 2002 issue of UK's Kerrang! magazine said that \\"Chuck Schuldiner was one of the most significant figures in the history of metal.\\" Schuldiner was born on May 13, 1967, on Long Island, New York to a Jewish father of Austrian descent and a mother from the American South, a convert to Judaism. Both of his parents were teachers. In 1968, his family moved to Florida. Schuldiner was the youngest of three children: he had an older brother named Frank and an older sister named Bethann. He started playing guitar at the age of 9; his 16-year-old brother had died and his parents bought him a guitar, thinking it would help with his grief. He took classical lessons for less than a year in which his teacher taught him \\"Mary had a Little Lamb\\", which he did not like very much, and almost stopped completely, until his parents saw an electric guitar at a yard sale and bought it for him. The young Schuldiner immediately took to the instrument. After getting amps, he never stopped playing, writing and teaching himself. Schuldiner was known to spend the weekend in the garage or his room playing his guitar, but was limited to three hours on weekdays when school was in session. Schuldiner first played in public in his early teens. Schuldiner was originally inspired by Metallica, Iron Maiden, Kiss and classical jazz, among others. He was particularly interested in the metal movement known as NWOBHM - New Wave of British Heavy Metal - and cited bands of that genre among his favorites. He frequently cited French band Sortilege as his personal favorite metal group. Slayer, Celtic Frost, Possessed, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond and Metallica were later influences he would apply more to his own band. Later in his career, Schuldiner frequently cited progressive metal bands such as Watchtower, Coroner and Queensryche as influences. The official Schuldiner website, Empty Words, quotes Schuldiner's mother making the claim that he enjoyed all forms of music except country and rap. He also enjoyed jazz and classical music in addition to metal and British alternative acts such as Lush. Schuldiner performed well in school before becoming bored with education, and eventually dropped out. He later regretted this decision. He has stated that if he had not become a musician, he would have liked to have become a veterinarian or a cook.

The correct answer is option c) because it directly relates to the topic of the paragraph - saving money on healthcare.

Moreover, avoiding the emergency room for routine care saves money as emergency room visits are often more expensive compared to regular appointments.

Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper.

She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with \\"If I Were a Boy\\"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while \\"If I Were a Boy\\" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio. The two songs were released as a double A-side...

According to this legend, Earth is supposed to somehow destroy this empire. Step 2: Assess the quote by Trevize Trevize expresses disbelief at how a dying world could be a potential threat to the entire empire. This skepticism shows that Trevize may be looking for a logical explanation or clarification regarding the matter. Step 3: Address Trevize's concerns In response to Trevize's doubts, I could provide more details about the legend to help him understand its basis and relevance. Step 4: Elaborate on the legend \\"At the core of the legend, it is believed that the people of Earth were gifted with immense intellect, cunning, and adaptability. As the environment grew uninhabitable, they went on to apply their incredible skills to devise a plan of retribution. This plan was said to be so ingenious that it would lead to the empire's eventual collapse.\\" Step 5: Offer a reason for the legend's existence \\"Believers of the legend argue that it is a reminder of the consequences faced by those who underestimate the power of a collective cause. Some interpret it as a warning to not disregard the potential of even the most diminished adversaries.\\" Step 6: Conclude the discussion So, while it may seem implausible that a dying world could be the undoing of a vast empire, the legend itself has persisted as an important cautionary tale - highlighting the significance of treating others fairly and not underestimating their abilities to fight back."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients.

For most people, it is a picture of a person wearing unusual clothes with a hat on his head, dancing to the music in a cool way. For example, a person who wears a large T-shirt dances on the street. Clearly, clothes those street dancers wear show their personalities and clothing styles. Now let us take a look at street dancers' clothing styles. Tops If you look into the clothing styles of street dancers, you will notice that there is a large difference between the tops that men and women wear. For men, they often wear a large T-shirt with probably a jacket at times. However, for women, they often wear tank tops (T) . Bottoms Today, the street dancers still prefer wearing large jeans and a lot of men also wear Capri pants . However, women start to wear mini skirts or shorts. Nowadays knee-high socks are also a popular new look for the women. Footwear For any street dancer, shoes are important. Any pair of shoes that produces the slightest sound can destroy the performance. So they need a pair of shoes that allows them to move freely. In fact, street dancers' clothing has to be something that allows for a lot of comfort and that shows personalities. The two points are important for any street dancer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Everybody has a little bit of creativity, but only a few lucky ones get to do what for a living? A. sew B. create art C. express yourself D. sing and dance E. write The best answer is A:","completion":"The best answer to this question is indeed a matter of perspective, as everyone has unique talents and the term \\"creativity\\" can mean different things to different people. However, considering the options provided, the best answer is B. create art. To elaborate on why this answer may be the best, it's important to understand that creativity is an innate quality that everyone possesses. Artists, throughout history, have demonstrated an impressive ability to showcase their creative expression through various art forms. Whether it's painting, sculpting, drawing, or any other visual art, the ability to create art has often been regarded as a highly desirable skill that not many can master. Although all the options listed portray some level of creativity, creating art professionally requires a deeper commitment to honing one's skills and talents. Artists must have a strong sense of imagination, a natural inclination towards aesthetics, and a keen understanding of human emotions. By dedicating their time to create evocative and meaningful pieces of art, artists can make a lasting impact on society as a whole. Option A, sewing, is indeed a creative talent that many people possess. However, it is typically seen more as a craft, hobby, or necessary skill for daily life rather than a vocation that relies primarily on creative expression. Sewing can also be quite functional and not always considered an art form. Option C, expressing oneself, is a basic human need but is not always synonymous with making a living. While one could argue that being a public speaker, influencer, or life coach falls under this category, they are not always associated with creativity in the same way as those mentioned in creating art or writing. Option D, singing and dancing, can be considered creative professions for those exceptionally gifted in these areas. However, these talents are often seen as more related to performance arts rather than original creative output, as performers often interpret and share the creative work of others such as singers performing songs written by someone else or dancers performing choreographed pieces created by a choreographer. Option E, writing, is also a form of creative expression and plays a crucial role in educating, entertaining, and inspiring people. However, writing often requires a different set of skills, such as analytical and communication abilities. Furthermore, writing can encompass various styles and purposes, from technical and functional writings to fictional storytelling, which diversify the idea of creativity within the writing profession. In conclusion, while all these options show different aspects of creativity, creating art involves a higher level of self-expression and emotional exploration, allowing the artist to make a living by creating lasting, impactful work. Therefore, the best answer is B. create art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Here is a goal: Make a book holder for children's books. How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of making a book holder for children's books, you can follow these steps: 1. Ideation and Planning: Before you start making the book holder, brainstorm some design ideas and think about what features and functionalities you would like it to have. For instance, do you want a simple open-shelf design, a closed cabinet, or one with compartments for different book sizes? Make sure your design is ergonomic, easily accessible by the child, and visually appealing. 2. Materials and Tools: Once you have a clear vision of what you want your book holder to look like, gather all the necessary materials and tools required. Some popular material choices include wood, plywood, MDF, or plastic. The tools needed may include a saw, screwdriver, hammer, measuring tape, level, pencil, drill, screws, wood glue, sandpaper, and a paintbrush or roller. 3. Measurements: Measure the space where you plan to place the book holder and decide on the dimensions based on the available area and the number of books you wish to store. Keep in mind children's height and accessibility while deciding the dimensions. 4. Cutting the Material: Following your plan, start by marking and cutting the material according to the desired dimensions. Make sure to use the appropriate saw and safety gear during this process. Cut all the necessary pieces such as shelves, sides, back, and top if applicable. 5. Sanding: Before assembling the pieces, it's essential to sand their edges and surfaces. This step helps create a smooth finish and avoid any rough edges that could be harmful to children. 6. Assembly: Lay out all the cut pieces and, following your design, begin assembling your book holder. You can use wood glue to attach the parts, screws to secure them, and a level to ensure the shelves are straight. If your design includes slots or dividers, install them now. If it has doors, attach them with hinges and add the handles. 7. Finishing touches: Inspect your assembled book holder for any imperfections, then sand as needed. Fill any gaps or holes with wood filler, smooth with a fine-grit sandpaper, and clean off any dust using a damp cloth. 8. Painting or Staining: Choose a paint or stain color that complements the room's decor and is safe for children. Apply a primer if needed, and then paint or stain the book holder following the manufacturer's instructions. You may need multiple coats to get the desired finish. Allow the paint or stain to dry completely. 9. Adding Personal Touches: You could further personalize the book holder by adding stickers, decals, or stencils that represent the child's interests. Another option is using chalkboard paint on one side, allowing the child to draw and write directly on the book holder. 10. Positioning and Organizing: Once the paint is dry, move the book holder to its designated spot and fill it with children's books. Organize the books by size, series, or favorite categories, making sure the most frequently used ones are easily accessible. By following these steps, you'll create a beautiful, functional, and safe book holder that encourages children to read and tidy up after themselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I can use this background: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] Now, I have a new situation: The underwater fishing teams picked their spots early. Team Bob went at the mouth of the river, where the freshwater met the salty seawater in the hope that more turbidity from the river and more nutrients will attract more fish.

Group says it is disappointed with EU Commission's 'confrontational' approach. EU antitrust breaches can incur fines up to 10 per cent of global turnover.","completion":"Title: Visa Europe Faces Regulatory Challenges Over Debit Card Fees Introduction Visa Europe, one of the leading payment processing companies, is under scrutiny as it grapples with the European Union regulators concerning its debit card fees. Although the company has tried to make amends by agreeing to certain terms, the recent confrontational approach by the European Commission has raised concerns among all stakeholders. Background Back in 2010, Visa Europe tried to address the issues surrounding its debit card fees by settling with regulators. By agreeing on various terms, the company hoped that it would avoid any more disputes about the charges that are imposed to millions of consumers who use their services. However, it seems that the situation is far from resolved, as the European Commission has recently adopted a more confrontational stance towards Visa Europe. Visa Europe's disappointment with the EU Commission Visa Europe has expressed its disappointment with the European Commission's confrontational approach towards their debit card fee policies. The company's representatives have argued that the aggressive stance of the regulatory body could potentially derail the progress made since the initial agreement in 2010. Moreover, Visa Europe believes that the efforts they have made to comply with the regulations have not been fully acknowledged by the regulators. EU antitrust breaches and potential fines When it comes to EU antitrust breaches, the stakes are high, as companies that violate these regulations can incur significant fines. In fact, charges can be as high as 10 per cent of their global turnover, which is by no means an insubstantial sum. Therefore, any organization, including Visa Europe, needs to take these regulations seriously and address the issues promptly and efficiently. The impact on consumers and businesses The ongoing tension between Visa Europe and the European Commission poses potential risks for consumers and businesses alike. As the payment processing landscape is continuously changing, it is essential that all stakeholders work together to promote a fair and transparent pricing environment. This would not only ensure the protection of consumer rights but also encourage healthy competition among payment processing companies. Looking ahead The dispute between Visa Europe and the European Commission regarding debit card fees highlights the complexities that arise in the modern financial landscape. On one hand, payment processing companies need to generate revenue to support their services; on the other hand, regulators must safeguard consumers and ensure fair competition among businesses. It is crucial that all parties involved, including the European regulatory bodies, try to collaborate on finding a balance that benefits everyone. Only then can the future of payment processing in Europe remain secure and promote innovation and efficiency within the industry. In the meantime, Visa Europe must continue to engage with regulators and demonstrate its commitment to providing transparent and fair services to its customers. Conclusion The ongoing regulatory challenges faced by Visa Europe is a testament to the dynamic nature of the financial and payment processing industry. With the European Commission adopting a confrontational approach, it is now crucial for both parties to find a mutually beneficial solution to ensure the continued growth and stability of the European payment processing market. Furthermore, striking a balance between revenue generation and consumer protection will likely be at the heart of any resolution concerning debit card fees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Adventures of Tartu Movie plot: Screenshot depicting London during the Blitz in 1940 British Captain Terence Stevenson (Robert Donat) accepts an assignment even more dangerous than his everyday wartime job of defusing unexploded bombs. Fluent in Romanian and German and having studied chemical engineering, he is parachuted into Romania to assume the identity of Captain Jan Tartu, a member of the fascist Iron Guard. He makes his way to Czechoslovakia to steal the formula of a new Nazi poison gas and sabotage the chemical plant where it is being manufactured. However, his contact is arrested before he can arrange for a job in the factory. Tartu is instead assigned work as a foreman at a munitions factory, where he is issued a German uniform. He is billeted in the house of Anna Palacek (Phyllis Morris) and her daughter Pavla (Glynis Johns), who works in the plant; also living there are German Inspector Otto Vogel (Walter Rilla) and the lovely Maruschuka Lanova (Valerie Hobson), who lives well by making herself popular with the German officers. That day Pavla shoots a German who earlier had had the man she loved executed. Tartu provides her with an alibi, winning her trust, and then reveals himself as a secret agent. Needing to get into the chemical plant, he asks her help to contact the Czech underground, and is surprised when she contrives for him and Maruschuka to go on a date. They talk guardedly but make it clear they are both working against the Nazis. At work the next day, Pavla is seen attempting sabotage. She whispers to Tartu to protect himself by denouncing her. He does, and she is summarily executed. The factory manager rewards Tartu by arranging the transfer he wants, to the chemical plant. The same day, Maruschuka contacts Dr. Novotny (Martin Miller), the leader of the local resistance group, and says she trusts Tartu.

The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity.

I read this background article the other day: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. I am facing a new situation today: Greg is an environmental scientist. He wants to know how earth's atmosphere differed in two different time. To that end, he selected two time periods, time A and time B. Time A is set in the year one thousand when using fossil fuels was not very common. Time B is set in the year two thousand when fossil fuels are used in large quantities. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which time more carbon dioxide would be realeased into the atmosphere, time A or time B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Time B would have more carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere compared to Time A. This is due to the increased usage of fossil fuels in the year 2000 (Time B) as opposed to the year 1000 (Time A), when the burning of fossil fuels was not very common. The extensive use of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, during Time B has led to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions. These emissions are a result of human activities, including industrialization, transportation, and energy production. In contrast, during Time A, human activities were primarily based on agriculture and had minimal impact on carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels in Time B releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is absorbed by processes like photosynthesis. This additional carbon dioxide acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping heat and contributing to the observed increase in global temperatures, known as global warming or global climate change. As a result, Time B has a greater release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, leading to more significant climate change impacts compared to Time A."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By 2012,the world may need to cope with as many as 50 million people who have fled their homeland,not for political or economic reasons but because the environment has been so badly changed that it cannot support life. The statement has been released by the United Nations to mark UN Disaster Reduction Day. More people are made homeless by environmental disasters than by war,according to the research by the Red Cross. That reality is proved by the earthquake in Pakistan. The widely publicized disaster has brought aid from the global community,according to Janos Bogardi,director of the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security. \\"If we can move swiftly in and give them a new start where they are,then they may stay in the area. Otherwise,they become environmental refugees. Environmentalrelated migrations are most acute in SubSaharan Africa,but they also affect millions of people in Asia and India. Meanwhile,the United States is witnessing increased pressure from victims of mismanaged and worsening soil and water conditions in Mexico and Latin America.\\" he says. Janos Bogardi says these refugees suffer from the impact of gradual environmental change--global warming,sea level rise,air and water pollution and more intense storms,floods and droughts that degrade the land. This is a slow process,but unfortunately a process that is very difficult to go backwards once final damage is done. Janos Bogardi says they are calling on the global community to recognize the serious situation of environmental refugees and to work together to lessen the impact of environmental disaster. What may be the best title of the passage? A) 50 Million environmental refugees by 2010 B) Environmental refugees--an international problem C) The cause of environmental disasters D) Global aid pouring in Answer:","completion":"B) Environmental refugees--an international problem"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - The Marxophone is a fretless zither with a system of metal hammers added for ease of playing . It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major ( middle C to C '' ) , and four sets of chord strings ( C major , G major , F major , and D7 ) . Sounding somewhat like a mandolin , the Marxophone 's timbre is also reminiscent of various types of hammered dulcimers . The player typically strums the chords with the left hand . The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings . A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note . Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings , which produces a mandolin - like tremolo . The bounce rate is somewhat fixed , as it is based on the spring steel strip length , hammer weight , and string tension -- but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip , effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer . Numerically coded sheet music prepared specifically for the Marxophone indicates when and in what order to play melody and chord strings . This type of music , similar to tablature , was produced for those who could not read standard notation . A rectangular piece of metal provides a backstop for the spring steel hammers , displays the name Marxophone and the patent number , and has clips that hold sheet music . It also marks the 15 keys by letter ( C , D , etc. ) , by number ( 1 - 15 ) and in standard musical notation . When the instrument is moved or stored , the metal rectangle bends down , holding the keys against the strings , so the Marxophone can fit into its case -- which is the size of a large briefcase . - A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a stringed instrument. For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a pick, and is a separate tool held in the player's hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat, B. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins. - Lute can refer generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the HornbostelSachs system), more specifically to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes. - In music, unison is two or more musical parts sounding the same pitch or at an octave interval, usually at the same time. - C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps. - The harp is a stringed musical instrument which has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the fingers. Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3500 BC. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. While some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Burma and in Sub-Saharan Africa, while other defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been revived by musicians in the modern era. - The mandocello is a plucked string instrument of the mandolin family. It has eight strings in four paired courses, tuned in fifths like a mandolin, but is larger, and tuned CC-GG-dd-aa (low to high in pitch). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin. - G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Its key signature has one sharp, F. - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\". - The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \\"octavus\\", the eighth). - In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp, flat, and rarely, natural symbols placed together on the staff. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline. - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola. - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians. What is the relationship between 'marxophone' and 'plucked string instrument'?","completion":"The relationship between the Marxophone and plucked string instruments lies in the fact that they are both types of stringed musical instruments. However, the way they produce sound and the mechanisms involved in playing them differ significantly. The Marxophone is a fretless zither with a system of metal hammers added for ease of playing. It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major, and four sets of chord strings. The player typically strums the chords with the left hand, while the right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings. The hammers bounce off the strings to produce the Marxophone's unique sound, which is somewhat similar to a mandolin and various types of hammered dulcimers. On the other hand, plucked string instruments are a class of musical instruments where strings are plucked using fingers, fingernails, or a plectrum. Examples of plucked string instruments include guitars, mandolins, ukuleles, and harps. In these instruments, sound is produced when the strings vibrate after being plucked. In summary, the Marxophone and plucked string instruments are both stringed musical instruments, but they have different approaches to creating sound. The Marxophone uses a hammer mechanism to strike the strings, whereas plucked string instruments involve directly plucking the strings with fingers or a plectrum."},{"prompt":"Facts: - residence: san francisco , california , united states - spouse: fatema akhund -lrb- 2009 -- present -rrb- - occupation: internet entrepreneur - education: computer science - children: aniya sophia akhund -lrb- born 2011 -rrb- - birth date: 16 april 1984 - name: immad akhund - ethnicity: pakistani - nationality: british - birth place: karachi , pakistan - religion: islam - alma mater: clare college university of cambridge Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of immad akhund .","completion":"Immad Akhund is a prominent British internet entrepreneur who hails from Pakistani ethnicity.

What is the name of the drilling fluid that is significantly more expensive than untreated petroleum fuels? Answer the above question based on the context below: Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit. Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene. They are inexpensive and easily available, and were once in common use; disadvantages include flammability and the aromatics they contain, which are a health hazard. Non-aromatic hydrocarbons.

The given equation is 65 = 14v + 23. To isolate the term with the variable v, subtract 23 from both sides of the equation: 65 - 23 = 14v + 23 - 23 This simplifies to: 42 = 14v Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 14. Now that the term with the variable v is isolated, divide both sides of the equation by 14 to solve for the value of v: 42 ÷ 14 = 14v ÷ 14 This simplifies to: 3 = v So, the solution for the given equation 65 = 14v + 23 is v = 3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bradley Manning verdict: guilty on most charges but not on 'aiding the enemy' - live updates Colonel Denise Lind, the military judge presiding over the court martial of the US soldier, delivered her verdict in curt and pointed language, writes Ed Pilkington from Fort Meade: “Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty,” she repeated over and over, as the reality of a prolonged prison sentence for Manning on top of the three years he has already spent in detention dawned. The one ray of light in an otherwise bleak outcome for the Army private was that he was found not guilty of the single most serious charge against him - that he knowingly “aided the enemy”, in practice al-Qaida, by disclosing information to the WikiLeaks website that in turn made it accessible to all users including enemy groups. Lind’s decision to avoid setting a precedent by applying the swingeing “aiding the enemy” charge to an official leaker will invoke a sigh of relief from news organisations and civil liberties groups who had feared a guilty verdict would send a chill across public interest journalism. Lind also found Manning not guilty of having leaked an encrypted copy of a video of a US airstrike in the Farah province of Aghanistan in which many civilians died. Manning’s defence team had argued vociferously that he was not the source of this video, though the soldier did admit to later disclosure of an unencrypted version of the video and related documents. The judge also accepted Manning’s version of several of the key dates in the WikiLeaks disclosures, and took off some of the edge from other less serious charges. But the overriding toughness of the verdict remains: the soldier was found guilty in their entirety of 17 out of the 22 counts against him, and of an amended version of four more. Once the counts are cumulatively added up, the prospects for the Army private are bleak. Barring reduction of sentence for mitigation, which becomes the subject of another mini-trial dedicated to sentencing that starts tomorrow, he will face a substantial chunk of his adult life in military custody. The consequences for Manning, and for the wider world of whistleblowing and official leaking in the digital age, will take time to sink in. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Bradley Manning was found guilty on most charges but acquitted of the most serious charge, 'aiding the enemy,' in a military trial presided over by Colonel Denise Lind.

Given the question: Given the background: Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi. and the situation: Bess and Dee were two entomologists. they were studying ants. Dee liked to learn more about leaf cutter ants, while Bess learned all she could about all other ants. Answer the following question: Which person read more about ants which build fungal gardens? The answer is:","completion":"Dee read more about ants which build fungal gardens. This is because Dee focused on learning more about leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex), which are known to feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. These ants are responsible for building fungal gardens by collecting leaves, cutting them into tiny pieces, and placing them in the gardens to cultivate fungus as their food source. Bess, on the other hand, learned about all other ants in general, and her study might not be focused on the ants that build fungal gardens as much as Dee's."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Blake Lively Shows Off Her Baby Belly 10/21/2014 at 10:00 AM ET For the first time since announcing they’re expecting their first child, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively stepped out as a couple while attending the Angel Ball at Cipriani Wall Street on Monday. The proud parents-to-be were all smiles as they made their way down the carpet. But the actor, 37, only had eyes for his leading lady — and once we saw the mom-to-be’s fitted, floor-length frock we knew why. Lively, 27, showed off her growing bump in a beautiful butter-hued gown from Gucci’s Resort 2015 collection, complete with a plunging embellished neckline. And while the Preserve founder accessorized with Lorraine Schwartz jewels, it was her gorgeous glow that really took her evening look to another level. On Thursday, Lively told PEOPLE she’s having to switch up her pregnancy ensembles to accommodate her growing bump. “Have you seen me!?” she joked. “I’m gonna amp up my style by wearing things that are stretchier — because that’s all that fits!” Although the couple haven’t announced whether they’re expecting a baby girl or boy, Reynolds already has a few names in mind. “I don’t want a name that’s anything pretentious or, like, Hollywood-y.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork.

Although research has been inconclusive, some findings have indicated that electronic communication negatively affects adolescents' social development, replaces face-to-face communication, impairs their social skills, and can sometimes lead to unsafe interaction with strangers. A 2015 review reported that “adolescents lack awareness of strategies to cope with cyberbullying, which has been consistently associated with an increased likelihood of depression.” Studies have shown differences in the ways the internet negatively impacts the adolescents' social functioning. Online socializing tends to make girls particularly vulnerable, while socializing in Internet cafés seems only to affect boys academic achievement. However, other research suggests that Internet communication brings friends closer and is beneficial for socially anxious teens, who find it easier to interact socially online. The more conclusive finding has been that Internet use has a negative effect on the physical health of adolescents, as time spent using the Internet replaces time doing physical activities.

Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to \\"Munshi\\": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, \\"the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.\\" Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice.

Please briefly summarize this news article: No. 20 Lady Vols need to regroup quickly after stunning loss or risk falling out of Top 25 In Tennessee's first season without Pat Summitt, the Lady Vols soon could drop out of the Top 25 for the first time in over a quarter-century. The No. 20 Lady Vols began the post-Summitt era Friday with a stunning 80-71 loss at Chattanooga. Now they don't have much time to recover from their first season-opening loss since 1999, as they continue their road trip Sunday at No. 22 Georgia Tech. A loss to the Yellow Jackets likely would drop the Lady Vols out of the Top 25 for the first time since February 1985. \\"That's just the nature of this game and the nature of our schedule,\\" said Tennessee coach Holly Warlick, who stumbled out of the gate in her head coaching debut after spending the last 27 seasons as an assistant on Summitt's staff. \\"It's extremely hard. With five new players, it is what it is. There's nothing we can do about it. We've got to roll up our sleeves and get back to work.\\" Summitt, who announced last year she had early-onset dementia, stepped down in April after collecting 1,098 wins, eight national titles and 18 Final Four appearances in 38 seasons. Summitt remains on staff as head coach emeritus, attends most of the Lady Vols' practice and watched Friday's game from the stands. The transition figured to cause some growing pains. Tennessee's No. 20 preseason ranking was its lowest position in the Top 25 since 1985. The Lady Vols don't return a single player who started an NCAA tournament game last season during their run to a regional final. Their roster includes five newcomers - four freshmen and a junior-college transfer. But nobody expected this kind of start. Tennessee committed 26 turnovers and had only six assists against Chattanooga. The Lady Vols had 17 turnovers in the first half alone. They never led in the second half and never cut Chattanooga's advantage below six points over the last 13 minutes. \\"We have to learn from this,\\" said Tennessee junior guard Meighan Simmons, one of only three upperclassmen on the roster. The biggest lessons came when Tennessee was on defense. Tennessee spent the preseason adjusting to an uptempo style designed to utilize Tennessee's speed and compensate for its relative lack of size. The Lady Vols believed their energy would harass opposing offenses and force turnovers. \\"We're not going to outscore anybody,\\" Warlick said. \\"We're not going to outshoot them. We've got to get them to turn the ball over to get easy looks.\\" While Tennessee struggled to take care of the ball all night, Chattanooga collected 17 assists and committed only 13 turnovers. The Lady Mocs scored 52 points and shot 56.3 percent from the floor in the second half. \\"Our defense was non-existent,\\" Warlick said. That defense will have to play much better for the Lady Vols to avoid their first 0-2 start since 1970. Georgia Tech went 26-8 and reached a regional semifinal last year and should get an emotional lift Sunday from playing the first women's game at the new McCamish Pavilion. The Yellow Jackets had to play their home games off campus last season. \\"As long as we learn from this, it's OK,\\" Warlick said. \\"If we keep making the same mistakes, we're not going to get any better.\\" There's one history lesson that could encourage Tennessee. When the Lady Vols last dropped a season opener back in 1999, they lost only three more times the rest of the season and went on to reach the NCAA final.","completion":"The Lady Vols, a girls basketball team, lost a game against another team called Chattanooga. This is their first season without their famous coach, Pat Summitt. They are now ranked number 20 and if they lose their next game against the Yellow Jackets, they might fall out of the Top 25. Their new coach, Holly Warlick, thinks they need to work hard and improve. They made many mistakes in their last game, and they need to play better defense. If they learn from their mistakes, they can get better and hopefully win more games in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A:","completion":"To answer the elaborate question regarding the passing of two renowned composers, Richard Strauss and Béla Bartók, we must first delve into the respective life stories and backgrounds of these two extraordinary musicians in order to understand their historical context, contributions to the world of music, and the events leading up to their deaths. Richard Strauss was a German composer, conductor, and pianist born on June 11, 1864, in Munich, Germany. He was an influential figure in the late Romantic and early Modern periods, known primarily for his remarkable skill in orchestration and his versatility in composing music across various genres, including opera, tone poems, chamber music, and lieder. Some of his most famous works include the operas \\"Salome\\" and \\"Der Rosenkavalier,\\" and the tone poems \\"Don Juan\\" and \\"Also sprach Zarathustra,\\" the latter of which was famously used in the opening scene of Stanley Kubrick's film, \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" Béla Bartók, born on March 25, 1881, in Nagyszentmiklós, Hungary (now Sânnicolau Mare, Romania), was a Hungarian composer and pianist who was a prominent figure in the early 20th century, immersed in the realms of both musical composition and ethnomusicology. Known for his fusion of Eastern European folk music and traditional classical music, Bartók's contributions continue to be regarded as some of the most unique and influential in the contemporary classical repertoire. His work reflects a deep understanding of the innovations of that era, such as the twelve-tone technique and the rise of atonality. Some of Bartók's most celebrated compositions include the six string quartets, the piano concertos, and the orchestral suite \\"The Miraculous Mandarin.\\" Now, equipped with the relevant contextual information, we can explore the events leading up to the passing of these two prominent composers. Richard Strauss's later years were marked by a number of challenges, both personal and professional. World War II and the rise of the Nazi regime cast a shadow over Strauss' life. His granddaughter's Jewish heritage further complicated matters, causing him distress in his final years. Despite these difficulties, Strauss continued to compose until his final days. He passed away on September 8, 1949, in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, at the age of 85. His final works bore a more introspective quality, such as the \\"Four Last Songs,\\" which poignantly reflect themes of death and transition. Béla Bartók's later years were also fraught with hardship and struggle. His staunch opposition to the Nazi regime compelled him to emigrate to the United States in 1940. Once in America, however, he found it difficult to establish himself professionally and faced financial troubles. Additionally, his health began to deteriorate—a diagnosis of leukemia would eventually be revealed. Despite these complications, Bartók remained productive; the final years of his life saw the completion of several important works, such as the \\"Concerto for Orchestra\\" and the \\"Third Piano Concerto.\\" His condition finally caught up with him, and Béla Bartók passed away on September 26, 1945, in New York City, at the age of 64. In summary, it becomes clear that Béla Bartók passed away first, on September 26, 1945, followed by Richard Strauss about four years later, on September 8, 1949. While both composers experienced hardships in their twilight years, their legacies continue to influence the world of classical music and provide inspiration to generations of musicians and listeners alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The scientists are foiled by an extremely dense layer of material at the boundary between the two. To penetrate the barrier and reach the magma below, they intend to detonate an atomic device at the bottom of the hole. The leader of the project, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), who is secretly dying of cancer, believes that the atomic device will burn its way through the barrier, but the project's chief geologist, Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore), is convinced that the lower layers of the crust have been weakened by decades of underground nuclear tests, and that the detonation could produce a massive crack that would threaten the very existence of Earth. The atomic device is used and Rampion's fears prove justified, as the crust of the Earth develops an enormous crack that progresses rapidly. Sorenson discovers that there was a huge reservoir of hydrogen underground, which turned the small conventional atomic explosion into a huge thermonuclear one that was millions of times more powerful. Another atomic device is used in the hope of stopping the crack, but it only reverses the crack's direction. Eventually the crack returns to its starting point at the test site, and a huge chunk of the planet outlined by the crack is expected to be thrown out into space. Sorenson remains at the underground control center to record the event despite pleas by his wife Maggie to evacuate with the rest of the project staff. She and Rampion barely escape in time to observe the fiery birth of a second moon. Its release stops the crack from further splitting the Earth. My question: What is Dr. Sorensen dying of?

(CNN) -- England midfielder Michael Carrick missed a first-half penalty as English Premier League champions Manchester United suffered a sensational 1-0 defeat at newly promoted Burnley. Michael Carrick misses his first-half penalty as Manchester United slumped to a stunning defeat at Burnley. The home side scored the only goal of the game in the 19th minute when Stephen Jordan's deep cross for Martin Paterson was headed away by United full-back Patrice Evra -- only for Robbie Blake to meet the ball on the volley and fire a spectacular shot into the top corner. United pressed hard for an equalizer and wasted a golden opportunity just before the end of the half when Blake turned from hero to villian by tripping Evra in the penalty area.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the specific Welsh name of that which takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere)? , can you please find it? Other early Welsh Arthurian texts include a poem found in the Black Book of Carmarthen, \\"Pa gur yv y porthaur?\\" (\\"What man is the gatekeeper?\\"). This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere). The Welsh prose tale Culhwch and Olwen (c. 1100), included in the modern Mabinogion collection, has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur's men, though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place. The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen, daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant, by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks, including the hunt for the great semi-divine boar Twrch Trwyth. The 9th-century Historia Brittonum also refers to this tale, with the boar there named Troy(n)t. Finally, Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads, a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes to assist recall. The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions, but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre-existing Welsh traditions. Even in these, however, Arthur's court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole, with \\"Arthur's Court\\" sometimes substituted for \\"The Island of Britain\\" in the formula \\"Three XXX of the Island of Britain\\". While it is not clear from the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae that Arthur was even considered a king, by the time Culhwch and Olwen and the Triads were written he had become Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon, \\"Chief of the Lords of this Island\\", the overlord of Wales, Cornwall and the North.In addition to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae.

He saves a girl called Sarah from a horde of the reanimated dead, and they escape through the floor of a church. An evil necromancer named Mathias confronts Sarah and demands an amulet given to her by her uncle before he died. Sarah refuses, and after threatening to unleash all the evils he can conjure, Mathias disappears. In the morning, Sarah and Jacob return to Sarah's house through streets, fields, churches and underground tunnels, pursued by hordes of demonic creatures. They arrive around midday to find Mathias is already there, holding a sword to Sarah's little sister Jill's throat. Mathias threatens to kill Jill unless Sarah gives him the amulet. Sarah makes Mathias promise he will let Jill go, and gives him the amulet. Mathias disappears with both Jill and the necklace, and Sarah begs Jacob to go save Jill from Mathias. Jacob reluctantly agrees. Jacob arrives at Sarah's dead uncle's house and fights Mathias. He manages to destroy the amulet, defeating Mathias, but Jill falls through a hole in the floor. Jacob dives after her and breaks her fall with his own body, unharmed himself because he cannot die due to a protection spell that Sarah's uncle cast before he died. They return to Jill's home.

Read this and answer the question Bitumen was used in early photographic technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.[not in citation given] What feature of bitumen use in photography made it impractical?","completion":"The feature of bitumen use in photography that made it impractical was the many hours of exposure in the camera that were required for the process."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie title: Frankenstein Created Woman Movie plot: Abetted by the elderly Dr. Hertz (Thorley Waters) and handyman Hans (Robert Morris), Baron Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) determines that the soul does not immediately leave the body upon death, and can be transplanted from one body to another with a special apparatus he has developed. Hans is in love with Christina (Susan Denberg), the disfigured daughter of a local innkeeper. Christina's father disapproves of their relationship because Hans's father was executed for murder -- an execution Hans witnessed as a young boy. One night, while visiting Christina at the inn, Hans fights with three upper class snobs -- Anton (Peter Blythe), Johann (Derek Folds) and Karl (Barry Warren) -- when they insult her. Later that night, the three snobs sneak back into the inn and assault Christina's father, killing him.Hans is arrested for the murder. Despite the sterling character references of Dr Hertz and Frankenstein, the testimony of Anton, Johann and Karl persuade the jury. Because Hans will not reveal his whereabouts during the time of the murder -- he was making love with Christina -- he is sentenced to die at the same guillotine that killed his father some twenty years earlier.Frankenstein sees this as an opportunity to test his new machinery on a human, and he has Dr Hertz arrange to receive Hans's dead body. Christina, unaware that Hans had been sentenced to death, stumbles upon the execution site and sees Hans die. Distraught, she throws herself off a bridge and drowns. Frankenstein and Hertz successfully trap Hans' soul. The authorities bring Christina to Dr Hertz's office. Frankenstein persuades Hertz to trap her soul; once they have healed her injuries and facial disfigurements, they will restore her soul to her body.The procedure is a success. At first Frankenstein refuses to reveal to Christina who she really he is or allow her to leave Hertz's house, but after a few weeks he takes her to see the guillotine. When Christina sees the device she cries out \\"Papa!\\" and faints. Frankenstein's suspicions are proven:...

What is the answer for the question: What Republics did the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public, except on special occasions? from the following article ? The 1896 French colonisation of Madagascar brought an end to the rule of the Merina sovereigns. The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past. The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions. In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire. The tombs, chapel, exterior of Manjakamiadina and two traditional wooden houses (Besakana and Mahitsy) have since been restored with further restorations planned to continue until at least 2013.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, \\"He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart.\\" When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\" on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: Early Seventies Britain was a very depressing place. It was completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike.

Ranaviruses can infect amphibians, reptiles and fish. In the UK, they have devastated common frog populations. This research suggests that the introduction of infected animals from aquatic retailers into ponds or moving species between different ponds may be exacerbating the problem. The findings are published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Dr Trent Garner, from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), told BBC News: \\"The virus seems to be spreading at a rate that exceeds the ability of a frog to hop, and there seems to be human-aided dispersal of the virus.\\" Ranaviruses are a group of viruses found across the world and they affect different species in different ways. In the UK, one type of ranavirus was found to be present in the South East of England in the 1980s, and it has since spread. It can kill common frogs either by causing sores and blisters to form on the animal's skin or by causing their internal organs to bleed. \\"In a certain proportion of populations, the disease persists. And when it persists, frogs decline by around 85%, and they don't seem to be recovering,\\" said Dr Garner. To analyse the movement of the disease in the UK, scientists looked at two decades of data recorded by a citizen science scheme called the Frog Mortality Project, which is now coordinated through Garden Wildlife Health. Genetic records suggested that ranavirus was not always present in the UK, and had probably been introduced to the UK on two separate occasions. The study also found that while infection is spread by the natural movement of amphibians, garden ponds could also be playing a key role. Dr Garner said: \\"Potentially garden ponds can act as stepping stones for infected animals to move around and reach new sites.\\" He said that taking frogspawn or frogs from one pond and placing them in another could be helping to spread ranavirus. \\"There are also other species that could potentially carry ranavirus - ornamental fish for example. So I do think there is a case to be made to investigate their role in infections.\\" Lead author Dr Stephen Price, from University College London, ZSL and Queen Mary University of London, said: \\"Ranavirus is one of the most serious health threats currently facing the UK's amphibian population. \\"So our findings that humans seem to have helped move the virus around, facilitating its rapid spread, could be translated into some straightforward ways to manage the risk of disease outbreaks.\\" He added: \\"We certainly don't want to discourage people from adding ponds to their urban gardens - this remains one of the most positive steps we can all take to support wildlife. \\"But equally we would strongly urge people to try to limit how much potentially-infectious material they're moving into and out of their gardens in the process.\\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter: @BBCMorelle What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Ranaviruses, which can infect amphibians, reptiles, and fish, have been devastating common frog populations in the UK.

Joe's farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops. But I can use this background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: What is an answer for this question: Which farmer helped to stabilize the soil more? A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it is evident that Gary, the farmer who started agroforestry a few years back and grows cover crops, helped to stabilize the soil more. The implementation of agroforestry practices has a significant impact on soil health, and the growth of cover crops further aids in soil stabilization and fertility. Let's delve deeper into the advantages of Gary's approach and how it contributed to better soil stabilization: 1. Agroforestry systems: By incorporating trees and shrubs alongside agricultural crops, Gary created an integrated ecosystem that significantly reduces the risk of soil erosion. The root systems of the trees not only hold the soil together but also create pathways for water to infiltrate, thereby reducing surface runoff and soil erosion potential. 2. Cover crops: Gary's decision to grow cover crops complements the benefits of his agroforestry system. Cover crops, being groundcover plants, protect the soil surface from the direct impact of raindrops and wind, which can dislodge soil particles and cause erosion. Their root systems also contribute to soil structure improvement, allowing for better water infiltration and reducing the speed of surface runoff. 3. Nutrient cycling: Through the growth of cover crops and the integration of trees in his agroforestry system, Gary was able to increase nutrient cycling in his soil. The roots of the cover crops and trees can penetrate deeper into the soil, making nutrients more accessible to the plants. Furthermore, the organic matter provided by the trees and cover crops decomposes, gradually releasing nutrients back into the soil. 4. Reduced nutrient loss: As explained in the background information, agroforestry systems like the one used by Gary can reduce nutrient loss into streams. The dense vegetation buffers and slowdown runoff, preventing nutrient leaching and preserving soil fertility. 5. Improved plant growth: The combined effect of agroforestry and cover cropping provides a healthy environment for plant growth. The improved soil structure and nutrient availability lead to increased overall crop productivity, while the trees and cover crops themselves offer additional benefits, such as habitat for beneficial insects and microorganisms, which further aid in the stabilization and enrichment of the soil. In conclusion, Gary, with his agroforestry system and cover crops, significantly contributed to soil stabilization on his farm. This approach not only protects the soil from erosion but also improves soil fertility and offers various ecological benefits, making his farming practices more sustainable than Joe's farm with depleted soil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge.

Just as it becomes clear that Kaufman may have no real talent, he puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation and song. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them making his big Elvis payoff all the more enjoyable. This is the first of many times we see Kaufman trick the audience, as \\"fooling the audience\\" is his performance style.His autistic, eccentric style catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who signs him as a client and immediately gets Kaufman on a new sitcom, 'Taxi' in 1975, much to the dismay of sitcom-hating Kaufman.

Around this time, he gains popularity by making successful guest appearances on the new show 'Saturday Night Live'.At a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance from a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer named Tony Clifton, whom Andy wants to guest-star several times on Taxi on his terms, and whose bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor.

Given the following context: Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources... answer the following question: What are the full scientific names of the mangrove tree species that all have the same characteristics?

The service at the city's St Mary's Cathedral was told the 28-year-old was a \\"family man and a gentle giant\\". Family and friends of the Newcastle United supporter were joined by club manager Alan Pardew and team captain Fabricio Coloccini. Mr Sweeney and fellow Newcastle fan John Alder, 63, were killed when the flight crashed in Ukraine on 17 July. A Newcastle scarf and shirt was placed on his coffin as a sign of his commitment to the team. The hour-long service was told Mr Sweeney loved reading, especially Lord Of The Rings and Animal Farm. The pews of St Mary's Cathedral were packed for the funeral service - a celebration of Liam Sweeney's life as it said on the front of the order of service. Some wore badges with a photo of Liam alongside Newcastle United's badge and others T-shirts bearing the message - RIP Sweeney and Alder. It was Liam's passion for the football club and Geordie pride which ran through the service. His coffin was brought in to the sounds of Local Hero. A poem read by friends Malcolm Pegg and Amanda-Jade Fowler told of how fervently he had followed his team. We also heard of Liam's love of reading, music and The Simpsons. Canon Robert Spence described him as \\"a gentle young boy who became a giant gentleman\\" and said he \\"deserves a place in Geordie mythology\\". There were plenty of thoughts too for the family of John Alder, the fellow fan whose body has not yet been found. Rachel Kerr, BBC News, at St Mary's Cathedral Prayers were also said for the family of Mr Alder during the service. A tearful rendition of a poem was read out in the cathedral, which included the words: \\"If the Toon were playing you were there, win or lose through bad and good, Newcastle United were in your blood.\\" Pictures inside the order of service showed Mr Sweeney when he was a boy in his Newcastle kit.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Hill town had two large forests nearby. Lake forest had trees that were in a symbiotic relationship with a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi were less prevalent in Brook forest. and a hint : Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. Please answer this question : Which forest had fewer AM fungi which reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's break down the information given in the hint and relate it to the situation of the two forests. Hint analysis: 1. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. 2. In these situations, plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi, and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. Now let's relate this information to the situation of the two forests: 1. Lake Forest: Has a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, indicating suitable environmental conditions for their growth. 2. Brook Forest: Has lesser arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, indicating that the environmental conditions might be different. From the hint, we can deduce that when the soil nutrient and moisture concentrations are higher, there are fewer AM fungi, and they reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. Based on the conditions specified in the situation, Brook Forest has fewer arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Therefore, it is more likely that Brook Forest is the one where AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae due to higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit.

Given the question: Information: - Ragtime also spelled rag-time or rag time is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War. - A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana.

Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. - Humphrey Richard Adeane Lyttelton (23 May 1921 25 April 2008), also known as Humph, was an English jazz musician and broadcaster from the aristocratic Lyttelton family. - Dennis Moss MBE ( 16 August 1927 -- 28 May 2008 ) was a British jazz tenor saxophonist . He was known for playing with most of the high profile figures of British jazz , including Vic Lewis , Ted Heath , Johnny Dankworth , Alex Welsh , and Humphrey Lyttelton . - Alex Welsh (9 July 1929 25 June 1982) was a Scottish Dixieland jazz musician, who played the cornet and trumpet, and sang. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Vic Lewis (29 July 1919 9 February 2009) was a British jazz guitarist and bandleader.

Becca is quickly befriended by many students at her new high school, including Jennifer (Anneliese van der Pol) but she is intrigued by the mysterious and aloof Edward Sullen (Matt Lanter), who perplexes her during their time in the biology class, despite thinking she smells of tuna.Later, Becca is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot. Edward inexplicably moves from several feet away and stops the vehicle by thrusting another student in its path without any harm to himself or Becca (the other student is very badly injured). He later refuses to explain this act to Becca and warns her against befriending him. After much research, she tells Edward that she knows what he is, but reaches the wrong conclusion that he is a Jonas Brother. Edward corrects her, saying he is a vampire but that he only consumes animal blood, and shows her the shiny bling he wears under his clothes.

Brownell allegedly assaulted the musicians near 21st and O streets about 11:45 p.m. Sunday. Police reported Tuesday evening that Brownell had turned himself in and was in custody at the Sacramento County Jail. Brownell allegedly uttered “sexual orientation epithets” before attacking the musicians, according to a press release by the Police Department. 20 for 365 Days of Unlimited Digital Access Last chance to take advantage of our best offer of the year! Act now! Police had arrested Brownell on Sunday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and illegal possession of a firearm. Officers said they found guns at Brownell’s residence when they arrested him. “The Sacramento Police Department has zero tolerance for these crimes,” the department said in a news release Monday evening. In social media posts, the injured musicians all said their attacker referred to them with homophobic slurs because they were wearing skinny jeans. Slaves guitarist Alex Lyman posted on Instagram that he suffered a 4-inch stab in his side not far from his spleen. Another guitarist, Weston Richmond, broke his right hand and had minor cuts. The band posted on Facebook that it will still headline the Sacramento Concerts in the Park event Friday, though Richmond will not be able to perform. Blake Abbey, the lead singer for local band Musical Charis, said on his Facebook page that he was stabbed in the arm and required surgery. Slaves is composed of Sacramento musicians who previously played in other area bands, including former Dance Gavin Dance lead vocalist Jonny Craig. The band released its only album in June 2014 and has more than 94,000 fans on Facebook. Sacramento police spokesman Officer Justin Brown had earlier said alcohol was also a factor in the assault. He called a triple stabbing “very unusual” for midtown. Local musicians James Cavern and Carly DuHain will host a benefit show Saturday night to raise money for the victims’ medical expenses. The show, titled “I Wear Skinny Jeans,” will begin at 10 p.m. at Pour House, 1910 Q St., where Cavern works. Cavern has played music with Abbey many times since he came to Sacramento four years ago, he said. His initial reaction to hearing about the stabbing was “shock and anger.” “There was a lot of shock factor hearing the word ‘faggot’ thrown around,” Cavern said. “The story seemed almost just unbelievable, that someone would respond in such a way over something like that.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In Sacramento, three musicians were stabbed in what has been reclassified as a hate crime.

The tweet discusses someone being at a credit union, with the situation suggesting that the person is looking for someone to help or adopt a cat (referred to as \\"kitteh\\"). However, the tweet mentions \\"nobody there can take him,\\" which indicates that the person has been unsuccessful in finding someone to tend to the cat. This is followed by the statement \\"talking about putting him outside 2nite\\" (tonight), which implies that the cat might end up spending the night outdoors, unprotected. Based on this context, we can analyze the sentiment expressed in the tweet. The tweet has a predominantly negative sentiment, as it talks about a dire and urgent \\"kitteh situation.\\" The writer seems concerned and slightly desperate, as they are actively trying to find a solution for the cat but are unable to succeed. By using the word \\"urgent,\\" the author emphasizes their need for immediate help for the cat. Anxiety and frustration are also present in the sentiment due to the unsuccessful search for assistance. The writer mentions that nobody at the credit union can take the cat, which conveys a sense of hopelessness or disappointment. This desperation intensifies with the idea of putting the cat outside, especially if it implies leaving the cat to the mercy of the environment and without shelter. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet is largely negative, marked by concern, frustration, and a sense of urgency. The author clearly cares about the well-being of the cat and is seeking help to improve its current situation, but has been met with disappointment and an inability to find a solution.

Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed. Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Although hernias can happen to anyone, certain factors might put you at a higher risk for herniation. These may be chronic conditions, or they may pass with time — for example, if you have a bad cough. Risk factors for hernias include: Increased abdominal pressure Coughing Heavy lifting Constipation Pregnancy Obesity Advancing age Smoking Steroid use A hernia is an imperfection in the muscular container of an organ. Because of this imperfection, the organ is pushed through an opening, resulting in a hernia. As the organ comes through the opening, it will create a swollen area or bulge in the skin. A hernia often gets bigger when you are standing or when you are straining. The site of the swollen area may vary depending on what kind hernia you have. The terms for different hernia types refer either to the location or the cause of the hernia. Inguinal - These are hernias occurring in the inguinal region (between the hip bone and crotch) or groin. Umbilical - Occur around the belly button Femoral - Occur along the inner thighs Incisional - Occur when incisions from prior surgeries create weak points in an organ's muscular container Diaphragmatic or hiatal - Occur when there's a congenital defect in the diaphragm If the hernia affects your intestine, it can change or even block the flow of food through your digestive system. This can cause an intestinal back-up that results in nausea and vomiting. If the intestine is not completely blocked, you may just see milder symptoms, like nausea without vomiting or decreased appetite. You may experience constipation if you suffer from an inguinal or femoral hernia low in the body. Constipation is, in essence, the exact opposite of vomiting. When the flow of feces is blocked, you may experience constipation -- instead of it all coming out, it stays in. Needless to say, this symptom necessitates immediate surgical intervention. Hernias can be very serious when they interfere with the functions your body needs in order to survive. If you are experiencing any constipation, see your doctor immediately. Many people with hernias don’t have any complaints of pain or severe or significant noticeable symptoms. But, they may have a feeling of heaviness or fullness in the affected area, especially in the abdomen. You might chalk this up to complaints of bloating. If nothing else, you'll feel keenly aware of your abdominal area, whether it's feeling full, weak, or just has a mysterious pressure. You can relieve the \\"bloating\\" from hernias by resting in a reclined position. Though it's not always present, pain is a sign of hernia — especially if there are complications. Inflammation can cause a burning sensation or sharp pain. Pressure build-up can result in a tearing pain that suggests the hernia is directly touching the muscle walls. Here's how pain affects hernias in different stages: Irreducible hernia: the hernia cannot return to a normal state, but instead gets larger; you may feel occasional pain. Strangulated hernia: the bulging organ is losing its blood supply, and could be dead soon without medical attention. You'll feel significant pain in this case, along with nausea, vomiting, fever, trouble moving your bowels. This condition requires emergency surgery. Hiatal hernia: the stomach bulges out of its cavity, causing chest pains. This also affects the flow of food, causing acid reflux and making it hard to swallow. Untreated hernia: hernias are usually painless and symptomless, but if left untreated, may cause pain and other health problems. All hernias have the potential to become dangerous. If you suspect you have one, you need to see a doctor for evaluation as soon as possible. He or she will determine whether you actually have one, and also discuss its severity and your treatment options. If you know you have a hernia and feel sudden throbbing or pain in the area, go to the emergency room immediately. The hernia could become \\"strangulated\\" and cut off blood supply, which is highly dangerous.","completion":"The article discusses the risk factors, types, symptoms, and potential dangers of hernias, emphasizing the importance of seeking medical attention for proper evaluation and treatment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"Title: Good for Board Game Enthusiasts but Needs Some Improvements Rating: ★★★ I've been using the com.boardgamegeek app for a while now and I have quite mixed feelings about it. The database of board games is impressive, allowing me to keep track of my collection and discover new games that I might be interested in. The user interface is also clean and easy to navigate, which definitely helps when I'm looking for something specific. However, there are some areas where the app falls short. The search functionality could be improved; sometimes it takes multiple attempts to find the game I'm looking for due to the app not loading the search results properly. I've also encountered some performance issues and occasional crashes that can be quite frustrating, especially when I'm in the middle of adding a game to my collection or reading reviews. The app's integration with the BoardGameGeek website could be more seamless as well. There are times where I have to switch between the app and the website to see all the information I need about a game, which is not very convenient given that they should serve the same purpose. Overall, the com.boardgamegeek app is a good starting point for board game enthusiasts, but it definitely has room for improvement. If the developers could address the performance issues and better integrate it with their website, I believe this app could easily become a 5-star resource for the board gaming community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point.

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which happened earlier, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration or the declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster? Context: The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference. Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent. Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression. Ireland distanced itself further from Britain with the introduction of a new constitution in 1937, making it a republic in all but name.

A black hole is created when a large star burns out. Like our sun, stars are unbelievably hot furnaces that burn their own matter as fuel. When most of the fuel is used up, the star begins to die. The death of a star is not a quiet event. First there is a huge explosion. As its outer layer is blasted off into space, the dying star shines as brightly as a billion suns. After the explosion gravity pulls in what's left of the star. As the outside of the star sinks toward the center, the star gets smaller and smaller. The material the star is made of becomes tightly packed together. A star is so dense that a teaspoon of matter from it weighs billion of pounds. The more the star shrinks, the stronger the gravity inside it becomes. Soon the star is very tiny, and the gravity pulling it in is unbelievably strong. In fact, the gravity is so strong that it even pulls light into the star! Since all the light is pulled in, none can go out. The star becomes black when there is no light. Then a black hole is born! That's what we know about black holes. What we don't know is this: What happens inside a black hole after the star has been squeezed into a tiny ball? Does it keep getting smaller and smaller forever? Such a possibility is hard to imagine. But if the black hole doesn't keep shrinking, what happens to it? Some scientists think black holes are like doorways to another world. They say that as the star disappears from our universe, it goes into another universe. In other words a black hole in our universe could turn into a \\"white hole\\" in a different universe. As the black hole swallows light, the white hole shines brightly--somewhere else. But where? A different place, perhaps, or a different time -- many years in the past or future. Could you travel through a black hole? Right now, no. Nothing we know of could go into a black hole without being crushed. So far the time being, black hole must remain a mystery. Black holes are a mystery--but that hasn't stopped scientists from dreaming about them. One scientist... When the star begins to die _ .

Plot title: Dead Snow Movie plot: A woman, Sara, is being chased through the snows of Norway. She is ultimately cornered and eaten by zombies in World War II Nazi SS uniforms. Seven students on Easter vacation arrive at a small cabin near Ãksfjord. The cabin is owned by Sara, Vegard's girlfriend. The group begins to drink and party until a mysterious hiker arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppe, led by StandartenfÃ¼hrer Herzog, occupied the area. For three years, the Nazis abused and tortured the local people. Near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, the soldiers looted all the town's valuables. However, the citizens staged an uprising and ambushed them, killing many. The survivors, including Herzog and Michael Schwab, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker then continues on his way. That night, Vegard wakes to a figure placing something beneath the floorboards of the cabin. He calls out, believing it to be Sara, but she ignores him and leaves. Vegard follows, and finds her outside covered in blood. Vegard suddenly jolts awake in his bed, revealing it was a dream. Meanwhile, the hiker has set up camp in the mountains and is eating dinner when he is disturbed by a noise outside. He investigates, and is attacked and killed by a zombie. The next morning, Vegard, out looking for Sara, discovers the hiker's body. He searches the area, falls through the snow into a cave, and is knocked unconscious. After sunset, Erlend finds an old wooden box filled with valuables and golden trinkets. They celebrate, and one of them pockets a gold coin. They eventually return the rest of the treasure to the box. Erlend goes to the outhouse where he and Chris have sex. Afterwards, Erlend return to the cabin, and drops a gold coin.

Many colleges students choose Business,Law not Computer Programming as their majors convinced that these professions are where the big money is.It is not unusual to see the college students taking a part--time job as a warm--up for the real battle.I often see my friends taking GRE tests,working on English or computer certificates and taking the driving tests to get a license.Well,I have nothing against being practical.As the competition in the job market gets more and more severe,students do have reasons to be practical. However,we should never forget that college education is much more than skill training.Just imagine,if your utilitarianism becomes the main trend on campus,leaving no space for the cultivation of students' minds,or development of their soul.We will see university is training out well--trained spiritless working machines.If utilitarianism controls society,we will see people lost in the money--making adventures;we will see humanity losing their grace and dignity,and that,would be disastrous.I'd like to think society as encouraging and people regard profit or fame only as a horse that pulls the courage.Yet without the driver picking direction,the courage would go straight and may even end out in a dangerous situation.

In July, he said Mrs Clinton had been careless but not criminal in handling sensitive material on her private email server while secretary of state. The issue flared up again with the discovery of new \\"pertinent\\" emails. They were reportedly found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of one of the Democratic presidential candidate's closest advisers. Mr Comey's letter to Congress late last month, revealing the bureau's inquiry into Mrs Clinton's emails had been revived, shook up the White House race and reinvigorated the campaign of Republican nominee Donald Trump. It was much ado about nothing, but it certainly amounted to something. While FBI Director James Comey, in effect, said \\"never mind\\" with regards to Hillary Clinton's emails, for the past two weeks the story has dominated the political conversation, and Democrats have paid a price. While Mrs Clinton's presidential hopes have stabilised, talk of a possible rout - and sweeping down-ballot victories in congressional races - are a distant memory. Mrs Clinton will now try to focus on her closing campaign message. Donald Trump almost certainly will continue to accuse his opponent of corruption and, perhaps, again allege the FBI is covering for her. With only two days until voting, the dust kicked up by this story won't have fully settled by the time Americans head to the polls. Once this election is over, there should be serious soul-searching within the FBI and the media about how this saga played out. The nation's top law-enforcement agency was a source of constant leaks, as internal disputes spilled into public view. If Mr Trump wins, many on the left will blame Mr Comey for the result. If Mrs Clinton prevails, she likely will bear a lasting grudge over this political near-miss. How FBI email verdict affects election The FBI director had announced that the agency would investigate if the newly discovered messages contained classified information. But in Sunday's follow-up, Mr Comey wrote: \\"Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation. \\"During that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State. \\"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\\" On board the candidate's campaign airplane, her team said they were always confident of the outcome. Communications director Jennifer Palmieri told media: \\"We're glad this matter has been resolved.\\" But the Trump team cried foul. Newt Gingrich, an adviser to the Republican nominee, tweeted: \\"Comey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this and announce something he cant [sic] possibly know.\\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted: \\"If FBI conclusions remain unchanged, that means she still was reckless & careless, still lied about classified info, lied re: # of devices.\\" Campaigning in Minnesota on Sunday, Mr Trump made no mention of Mr Comey's findings. But he did say Mrs Clinton \\"will be under investigation for a long, long time, likely concluding in a criminal trial\\". He also renewed his claims that the Democrat was being \\"protected by a rigged system\\". The FBI has already established Mrs Clinton had classified information on a private email server that was run out of her upstate New York home. Mr Comey said in July that her handling of sensitive material during her 2009-13 tenure as secretary of state was \\"extremely careless\\", but cleared her of criminal wrongdoing. The revelation that she handled sensitive information while breaking federal rules by running her own email server has dogged her campaign since last year. A new NBC/Wall St Journal opinion poll on Sunday before news broke of the FBI letter suggested a four-point lead for Mrs Clinton. The latest Washington Post/ABC tracking poll put her lead at five points. Sunday's campaign stops take her to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Also on Mr Trump's itinerary were Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Who is ahead in the polls? 48% Hillary Clinton 44% Donald Trump Last updated November 8, 2016 Who will win?

Article: What color do you like best? Do you like yellow, orange and red? If you do, you must be an optimist, a leader, or an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer grey and blue? Then you are probably quiet, shy and you would rather follow than lead. If you love green, you are likely to be strong-minded and determined. You wish to succeed and want other people to see you are successful. At least this is what psychologists tell us. They have been seriously studying the meaning of color preference, and the effects that colors have on human beings. They tell us that we don't choose our favorite color as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you do so as soon as you open your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly. Black is while light and bright colors make people not only happier but more active. A yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and more comfortable than a dark green one does, and a red dress adds warmth and cheer to sad winter days. It is a fact that factory workers work better, harder and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or dark grey. Remember, then, that if you feel low, you can always brighten your day or your life with a few colorful things.

Country singer Billy Ray Cyrus honored a Nevada teacher killed by a 12-year-old student in a schoolyard shooting last year, calling him a 'true American hero.' Cyrus praised Michael Landsberry and presented a memorial plaque to his widow, Sharon, during a concert Saturday night in Incline Village, a Nevada community on north shore of Lake Tahoe. Police say Landsberry, a 45-year-old ex-Marine, tried to talk the shooter, 12-year-old Jose Reyes, into turning over the handgun before he was shot in the chest Oct. 21 at a middle school in the Reno suburb of Sparks. The student wounded two classmates before taking his life. Hero: Billy Ray Cyrus meets with the widow of Michael Landsberry, whom the country star lauded as a hero on Saturday. 'Tonight we are here to honor a true American hero,' Cyrus told a crowd of over 1,000. 'Michael Landsberry made the ultimate sacrifice to save his students after serving three terms in Afghanistan.' Cyrus said Landsberry also represented the courage of the Vietnam veteran honored in his patriotic song, Some Gave All. With a large photograph of Landsberry in the background and the math teacher's widow on stage, Cyrus led the crowd in singing the song. Cyrus said he was moved by the story of Landsberry's actions in the school shooting and decided to recognize him when offered a chance to perform at Lake Tahoe. He and his father, Ronald Ray Cyrus, made similar presentations honoring American heroes for more than a decade, and this marked the first time the country star has done so since his father's 2006 death. 'Just about every year, my dad and I would find an unsung hero and present them with a Some Gave All' award,' he told The Associated Press. 'I kind of play everything by ear, and I thought sometime when the time is right, I would love to recognize the sacrifice Michael made,' he continued. Marine: Landsberry, a former Marine, tried to get Jose Reyes to put the gun down before the 12-year-old killer fatally shot him. Sharon Landsberry thanked Cyrus and said his tribute moved her and their two daughters, Alisa Cook, 25, and Andrea Cook, 18. Alisa Cook also attended the concert, while Andrea Cook offered a videotaped message from an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, where she serves in the Marines. 'We all love him today. ... He lives within all of us,' Sharon Landsberry said of her husband. Cyrus, who rose to fame in 1992 with the hit song Achy Breaky Heart, also gave her a 'financial gift.' The amount was not disclosed. Interviews with Reyes' parents, teachers and classmates and the boy's own writings paint a portrait of a child troubled by depression and feelings of inadequacy at home and tormented by a school life in which he was mocked, teased and mistreated. Some warning signs were there. His father had taken him to a psychotherapist just three days before the shooting and the doctor proscribed an antidepressant after the boy told of being teased at school, called 'gay' and accused of peeing in his pants. His mother had done research on autism after Jose showed signs of it. 'True American hero': Cyrus mentioned Landsberry's three tours in Afghanistan when honoring the 'true American hero' A look at his phone and his video viewing habits was more troubling. In addition to phone images of the two teens who committed suicide after killing 13 at Colorado's Columbine High School in 1999, Sparks Police Chief Brian Allen said Tuesday investigators found searches on the Reyes family laptop in both July and October for 'Super Columbine Massacre Role Playing Game.' Forty-seven of the 69 video games in the boy's collection were 'violent themed first-person shooter or shooter type games' such as Grand Theft Auto V, Assassins Creed and Call of Duty 4. The youth who had wrestled with speech problems since kindergarten, who students told police been called 'stupid' and/or 'retard' in the hallways and poked by others in the side, tried to explain in separate suicide notes that offer insight and contradiction. In one to 'teachers and students,' Allen said the boy 'clearly expressed anger ... over his belief that he was embarrassed and mistreated at school' and 'indicated he would get revenge.' Reyes wrote that he'd been called gay, lazy, stupid, an idiot, had his money stolen and been accused of wetting his pants. Killer: 12-year-old Jose Reyes showed several signs that he was capable of violence - investigators discovered the boy's admiration for the Columbine High School killers. 'Well that all ends. Today I will get revenge on the students and teachers for ruining my life,' he wrote, adding that he would bring a pistol and rifle to school 'to shoot you and see how you like it when someone (sic) making fun of you.' 'Have a great death at school,\\" he said on the one-page note of spiral notebook paper he closed with a drawing of a tombstone that read: 'Sparks Middle School 1965-2013.' But in the second contradictory note to his parents, he said 'this shooting is not because of the shooting games, bullying or other stuff.' He said it was because 'some bad things in the past cause of me.' 'And now I'm just a monster,' Reyes wrote. 'If you hate me and my family doesn't love me it's okay. I know that I'm just an idiot. But I love you and I wish the past would be good and better someday.' Police learned one of the students shot during the rampage had teased Reyes about not having muscles during a physical education class, had called him names and may have played a part in pouring water on him when he was accused of wetting his pants. The mistreatment didn't rise to the level to merit bullying charges, Allen said. Terrifying: Two other students were wounded before Reyes killed Landsberry and then took his own life. Police earlier said Reyes' parents could be charged if they knowingly made the 9 mm pistol available to the boy. But Allen said Tuesday the investigation turned up no evidence that Jose and Liliana Reyes were aware that their son knew where the 9 mm pistol was kept in a kitchen cabinet. Ken Robison, a Reno lawyer for the parents, said prosecutors indicated to him earlier they would not be charged, but Tuesday's announcement brought a 'sense of relief.' Allen said the boy acted alone and did not communicate his plan to anyone. 'We will never know the complete motive or intent behind this tragic incident as the only person with the true knowledge felt acting out in violence and taking his own life was the best course of action,' he said. 'That in itself is a tragedy.'

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Understand that even if you were an outstanding undergraduate (as most graduate students were), you will face an entirely different set of challenges in graduate school. The specific nature of your coursework, research, teaching, and laboratory obligations will vary tremendously depending on your field, your school, and your department, and so will your potential paychecks and funding packages, so do some research and figure out what, exactly, you’re signing up for. Many department websites will answer your basic questions about particular programs, so start there to get a sense of what your obligations as a graduate student might be. Consider contacting current students as well. Most programs have a Director of Graduate Studies who can put you in touch with students in your program. You can then send an email or two to ask more specific questions. Current students may have insights about the standard workload and funding packages, and – unlike the website – they may be forthcoming about the potential downsides of pursuing a degree in their department. Graduate school is not something to do just because you can’t think of anything else to do with your life. No one should sink years of time, money, and energy into a graduate degree without being crystal clear about his or her goals and what is required to achieve them. This goes double for people with families. Know your reasons for pursuing a graduate degree, and do some extra research about what your opportunities will look like after graduate school – don’t just assume that your M.A. or Ph.D. will get you a wonderful job. Many people in the academic world are reluctant to admit this, but the job market for academics is abysmal right now, especially in the humanities and social sciences. If you are pursuing a graduate degree in one of these fields, think twice: even if you go to a top program and do well, you may find yourself, five to ten years down the road, with an impressive Ph.D., considerable debt, and no job. For graduate students with a family, this might be especially troubling. Do your research, and go in with your eyes open (if at all). If you are married or in a committed relationship, it is imperative to discuss the upcoming challenges with your spouse or partner. For most people with families, beginning a graduate program will entail some combination of relocating, quitting jobs, creating a new budget, making new child-care arrangements, and re-evaluating the division of household labor. These are major, life-changing developments, so work to discuss them openly and honestly. If your partner is not an academic, he or she may not fully understand what your new commitments will look like. Once you’ve done the research yourself, make sure you pass along your knowledge and clear up potential misunderstandings – let your partner know, for example, if you think you’ll need to work on weekends or travel for research. If your children are old enough to understand, you’ll need to discuss your plans openly with them as well. Remember that your decision to attend graduate school will change their lives, too: they will likely need to adjust to new schools or child-care facilities, changes in their schedules, and less time with you. Be up front with them, in a way that’s appropriate to their ages and maturity levels, and explain why you’re taking this path. Whatever your financial circumstances, graduate school is an expense to be considered carefully. Ideally, you should avoid going to graduate school, especially in the humanities and social sciences, unless you are fully funded by your program of choice – “fully funded” generally meaning that you receive a tuition waiver and a modest monthly stipend, often in exchange for teaching or laboratory duties. But people with families should be extra cautious, especially since “full funding” will probably not include money for expenses like child care. Research child-care costs ahead of time. If you’ve been a stay-at-home parent and plan to pay for child care for the first time, you may have no idea how expensive these services can be. If you’re quitting a “real world” job to attend graduate school, you may not realize how insufficient your stipend will be once you subtract the costs of child care from it. Either way, you need to know what you’re getting into. Be sure you look into any tax credits or deductions associated with child care costs. Factor in changes to your partner’s income, too. If you’re married or in a committed relationship, your partner’s income also needs to be assessed. Are you moving to attend graduate school? If so, your partner will probably have to find a new job – how will you pay the bills in the meantime? Will your decision to attend graduate school affect your partner’s work schedule or potential for overtime hours? If so, you need to consider that as well. You may be tempted to get as much financial aid as possible from the government, but though this decision might be appealing right now, it’s probably unwise in the long term. Ph.D. programs, especially, take a very long time; the debt will add up, and then, in the end, you’ll face the horrible academic job market. How will you pay it back? Summary:","completion":"Graduate school presents a unique set of challenges, including coursework, research, and financial obligations, which demand careful consideration, research, and open communication with family members to determine if it is the right path for you and your goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the family that owned Belton House before it was accepted by the National Trust?, using the article: Until its acceptance by the National Trust, Belton House was always in the ownership of the family of its builder, though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass sideways and sometimes through the female line. The owners of Belton are buried in the village of Belton's parish church close to the house. Their tombs are collectively one of the most complete sets of family memorials in England—continuous generation to generation for almost 350 years. The earliest Brownlow buried here is the founder of the family fortune the lawyer Richard Brownlow (1555–1638), and one of the most recent is the 6th Baron Brownlow (1899–1978). The owners of Belton House have been: Sir John Brownlow I (1594–1679) Bequeathed Belton to his great-nephew John Brownlow II. Sir John Brownlow II (1659–1697).

The constant terms on the right side of the equation are -24312 and -32800. We can combine these terms by adding them: -24312 + (-32800) = -57112 So we get the equation: -16927 = 855*l - 57112 Step 2: Add 57112 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable (855*l). To isolate 855*l on the right side of the equation, we add 57112 to both sides: -16927 + 57112 = 855*l - 57112 + 57112 40185 = 855*l Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 855 to solve for l.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - Ronald McKinnon ( born September 20 , 1973 ) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League .

Enclosing some 3.9 million ft (360,000 m) in exhibition space and hosting more than a million visitors each year, the GWCC is the third-largest convention center in the United States. Opened in 1976, the GWCC was the first state-owned convention center established in the United States. The center is operated on behalf of the state by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which was chartered in 1971 by Georgia General Assembly to develop an international trade and exhibition center in Atlanta. The authority later developed Centennial Olympic Park and the Georgia Dome. The Georgia Dome's replacement, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, is currently under construction and is scheduled to open in June 2017; while the GWCCA will own the physical stadium, the Atlanta Falcons will be responsible for its operation. - Christmas or Christmas Day (meaning \\"Christ's Mass\\") is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family. - A touchdown is a means of scoring in both American and Canadian football. Whether running, passing, returning a kickoff or punt, or recovering a turnover, a team scores a touchdown by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone. - The Harlon Hill Trophy is an award in American college football given to the individual selected as the most valuable player in NCAA Division II.

Article:The University of Glasgow researchers found that participants in the Scottish government-funded Walk Well programme were not walking more or sitting less. They said participants had difficulties finding time to walk with carers, which may be due to social care budget cuts. They said more intensive or home-based programmes may be required in future. Dr Craig Melville, senior lecturer in learning disabilities psychiatry, said: \\"Cuts in social care budgets have disproportionately impacted on disabled people and even when social care support is available, it is often not funded at a level that allows paid carers to support adults with intellectual disabilities to be physically active.\\" According to the study, only 5% of adults with intellectual disabilities meet public health recommendations for physical activity, compared to 64% of adults in the general population. About 50% were classed as obese, compared to a national average of 25%. The Walk Well intervention programme was designed for adults with intellectual difficulties to increase their levels of physical activity and reduce the time they spend sitting. The programme was funded by the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish government. It consisted of three face-to-face physical activity consultations, which included behaviour change techniques, written resources for patients and carers, and an individualised structured walking programme. Researchers carrying out the review selected 102 participants at random - 54 took part in the Walk Well programme and 48 were on a waiting list. Over a 12-week period, both groups took fewer than 5,000 steps per day and 59% had a BMI in the obesity range. A majority of participants lived in the most deprived neighbourhoods of Scotland. Dr Melville said: \\"The lack of effect in the Walk Well trial may be due to a lack of availability of social support to make walking accessible, facilitate community participation and moderate social disadvantages.\\" He also suggested that social enterprises, volunteer organisations and buddy programmes might have a role to play in supporting adults with intellectual disabilities to be more active. A Scottish government spokesman said: \\"The Scottish government is committed to improving the lives of people with learning disabilities, and we acknowledge this report. \\"We want people with learning disabilities to enjoy a healthy life.

The Walk Well programme was designed to reduce sedentary time, increase physical activity, and provide support through consultations and walking programs tailored to individuals with intellectual difficulties. However, researchers found that participants faced challenges finding time to walk with carers, which may be a consequence of social care budget cuts. Lead researcher Dr. Craig Melville emphasized that cuts in social care budgets have had a disproportionate impact on disabled people, with social care support often underfunded to the extent that it cannot adequately support adults with intellectual disabilities in being physically active.

That is the home of the Johnson Space Centre. There they are tested to see how strong and smart they are. One of the first tests is for the heart. The people walk or run, then the space doctors see how fast their hearts are beating. Another important test is performed. In this test the person must curl his body up in a ball. When he is in that position, he is put into a round cloth bag. The doctors give him no idea how long he will have to stay in the bag. If a spaceship broke down in space, the astronauts would get into bags like this. Then they would have to wait and curl up in darkness, until help could arrive. You can see that an astronaut must not be afraid of tight space or darkness. After the tests, only the best people are chosen to start astronaut training in a training centre. The astronauts in training learn many other things. They learn how to jump out of a moving airplane. They learn to how to blow up a lifeboat and get into it while they are in the ocean. The astronauts also have to learn how to get lifted out of the ocean by helicopter . That may look fun, but it can be dangerous. After they finish training, the astronauts continue to work. They stay in good shape by running and doing exercise. They read about their special jobs. In that way they can learn new facts about space travel. Then the big day comes. The astronaut is told to go to work on a flight into space. The crew members get to know each other first. Then they can learn which job each will do. Which of the following is NOT true? A) After the tests, only the best people are chosen to start astronaut training in a training centre. B) The crew members get to know each other after the tests.

Article: FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — A black college football player killed by a white police officer likely used a synthetic psychedelic drug and marijuana prior to the deadly confrontation at a Texas car dealership, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday. Christian Taylor was unarmed when Arlington police officer Brad Miller shot him on Aug. 7. Miller has been fired. The report shows there was THC, one of the active components of marijuana, and a synthetic drug that causes hallucinations in his system. The autopsy also showed Taylor was shot four times, in the neck, torso and abdomen. The 6-foot-tall, 19-year-old attended Angelo State University in San Angelo in West Texas, where he was to start his sophomore year on the team. The Tarrant County district attorney has said it will bring a case against Miller, 49, to a grand jury. However, the Arlington police department has yet to hand over the case, according to spokeswoman Samantha Jordan. Miller's attorney John Snider said he hoped that in light of this evidence, the Arlington police chief would reconsider his decision to fire Miller. Security footage from the lot shows Taylor breaking out the windshield of a car on the lot and then driving his vehicle into the glass showroom. There is no video footage of the shooting itself. Inside the showroom, Miller ordered Taylor to get to the ground. Instead, Taylor cursed at the officer and advanced toward him. The officer fired when Taylor was about 10 feet away, Arlington police chief Will Johnson said in a news conference last month. Friends of Taylor said he had recently developed a zeal for his Christian faith. According to the autopsy report, he had biblical verses, an angel and a cross tattooed on his body. ||||| Christian Taylor, the black, unarmed 19-year-old whose fatal shooting by an Arlington police officer last month garnered national attention, had used a synthetic drug that can cause hallucinations before his death, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday by the Tarrant County medical examiner’s office. The autopsy characterized the illegal psychedelic found in Taylor’s blood, an NBOMe, as a drug that’s known to “cause distorted perceptions, agitation and hallucinations” and one that has been “associated with random and bizarre behavior in users.” The autopsy report likened some of the drug’s effects to those of LSD. Taylor’s autopsy also indicated recent use of marijuana. Taylor, an Angelo State University football player, was shot four times in the early morning of Aug. 7. Brad Miller, an officer in training, was one of six officers responding to a burglary call at a car dealership. He fired after Taylor reportedly rushed him. Surveillance video showed Taylor acting erratically before the shooting. Taylor’s death was ruled a homicide. Arlington Police Chief Will Johnson fired Miller four days after the shooting, citing Miller’s failure to follow proper police procedures during the call. Police said at the time they expected to present the case to a Tarrant County grand jury. Zhivonni McDonnell, a public information officer for Arlington police, said late Wednesday the department declined to comment: “The case will continue progressing through the criminal justice system.” Taylor’s family could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Mike Heiskell, an attorney who represents the family, told WFAA-TV (Channel 8) that “regardless of what may have been in his system, this was still an unjustified death of a young man.” But John Snider, the attorney representing Miller, said in a statement that the autopsy report is “very significant evidence.” “In light of this crucial development we hope that Chief Johnson will reconsider his rush to judgment,” he said in an emailed statement. Snider had previously criticized Johnson, saying he only fired Miller to “appease anti-police activists.” The footage Surveillance camera footage released shortly after the shooting showed Taylor at the dealership, at one point standing on the hood of a silver Ford Mustang, stomping on the glass and trying to rip it away, and eventually trying to climb inside. Taylor also drove his Jeep through the dealership’s showroom window, though that’s not shown on camera. Taylor died from gunshot wounds to the neck, chest and abdomen, according to the autopsy. The report stated “all the bullets appear to have been fired in front of him,” indicating Taylor was facing Miller when he was shot. According to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration, the drug commonly known as “N-Bomb” that was found in Taylor’s blood can cause agitation, aggression and visual and auditory hallucinations, among other health issues. At least 19 deaths nationwide have been linked to a set of synthetic drugs known as the NBOMe compounds, according to the DEA. A bill introduced in the Texas Legislature this year by Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, added the NBOMe compounds and other substances derived from the same chemical structure to Penalty Group 1-A, which carries felony punishment. That law went into effect Tuesday. Friends’ reactions Taylor was arrested in 2013 on a misdemeanor drug possession charge. The charge was dismissed after he completed probation this summer. His friends said they never saw him using drugs. Legista Beckford, who was Taylor’s close friend and teammate at Angelo State, said the budding defensive back was always the first person to say no to any kind of unsafe behavior. “He was always the guy to be like, ‘Put on your seat belt,’ or ‘Be safe in my car,’” Beckford said. Taylor’s close friends from Mansfield Summit High School said he had specifically steered clear of narcotics. “In front of my face, I’ve never seen him do drugs,” said Sam Armardi. “Marijuana is probably the only thing anybody did in high school.” And after Taylor turned suddenly religious over the summer, his friends said, he seemed intolerant of even small vices. “He was saying: ‘You shouldn’t be smoking. You shouldn’t be doing this. You shouldn’t be doing that. God is good. God is great,’” Armardi said. Armardi said he had heard unconfirmed rumors that Taylor had used LSD with a friend one month before his death and had planned to use it again the night he was slain. “Those were the only two times they did it, and we never heard about the drugs again until after he passed away,” Armardi said. Several friends recalled Taylor talking about running out of time or being tired. Most assumed he was just worn out from football practice or college stress. “He told me he was a little depressed,” said Jordan McHenry. “We were just wondering if he needed help.” Taylor didn’t respond well to the suggestion. “Jordan just called me thinking that I’m crazy and need help,” he texted to his friends’ group chat a few weeks before his death. “Are you crazy?? … I know I’m living right with God.” Staff writers Avi Selk and Claire Z.

The dogs could be playing together but not necessarily chasing each other. 3. The dogs might be running after an object, such as a ball or a stick thrown by their owner. 4. The dogs might be running away from something or someone. 5. The dogs could be chasing something else entirely, like a squirrel or a bird, and not each other. To determine whether the dogs are, in fact, chasing each other, additional information would be required. This information could include a more detailed description of the dogs' behavior, accounts from observers, or even video footage showing the interaction between the dogs as they run in the snow. In conclusion, we cannot draw a direct relation between the statement \\"The dogs are running in the snow\\" and \\"The dogs are chasing each other.\\" Further information and context would be necessary to make this determination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Aaron Turner (born November 5, 1977) is an American musician, singer, graphic artist, and founder of label Hydra Head Records. He is most widely known for his role as guitarist and vocalist for the post-metal band Isis, while also participating in several other bands and projects such as Old Man Gloom, Lotus Eaters and Split Cranium, a collaboration with Jussi Lehtisalo of Finnish band Circle who toured with Isis in 2009. Though raised in New Mexico, Turner moved to the Boston area where he attended school and formed Isis and Hydra Head. In June 2003, Turner moved operations of both the band and label to Los Angeles, California. Context: Touring with Isis in 2007, Turner used two different guitars: a 1976 Fender Telecaster Custom (black), and a 1975 Fender Telecaster Deluxe (brown), played through various effects (his pedalboard layout changed every gig depending on what songs the band decided to play that night), a VHT/Fryette Pitbull Ultra Lead, and two 4x12 Sunn cabinets. He has also acquired a custom guitar from the Electrical Guitar Company (as did fellow Isis guitarist Michael Gallagher). In the past, Turner has also used a Gibson Les Paul Standard, PRS CE24, and has played through Sunn, Mesa Boogie, and Mackie amplifiers. When playing with Isis, Turner and his fellow guitarists usually tuned their instruments (low to high) B-F#-B-E-G#-B, to achieve a heavier sound. They also used other tunings, though less frequently, such as F# (octave below)-F#-B-E-G#-B. In 2016, Turner described the live rig he used with SUMAC as consisting of two custom-built guitars from the Electrical Guitar Company. Both have lucite bodies and aluminum necks, and custom-wound wide frequency range pickups. The newer of the two--a prototype for a signature model--has a slightly flatter fingerboard radius than the older instrument. On a tour of the Eastern US, Turner was using an Orange Dual Dark 100 amplifier head with a slaved Fryette Two/Ninety/Two power amp. Both heads drove Orange and Marshall cabinets, though Turner claimed to have no strong preferences for particular speaker cabinets. While recording, Turner prefers to use a Fryette Pitbull Ultra Lead, an amp model he's used consistently since his work in Isis. Turner described using a variety of effects pedals in his live rig. Specifically, he runs a BOSS TU-3 Chromatic Tuner, a Death By Audio Apocalypse fuzz, a MASF fuzz, a Strymon BlueSky reverb (which he described as the one essential pedal in his rig), a TC Electronics Ditto Looper X2, and an EHX Forty-Five Thousand sampler (used to trigger preset samples during performance. Turner prefers a Heil PR20 vocal microphone. Question: What is an example of a guitar effects pedal that he used? Answer:","completion":"An example of a guitar effects pedal that Aaron Turner used is the Strymon BlueSky reverb pedal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language. - Lhotse Shar is a subsidiary mountain of Lhotse, and the 11th-highest mountain on Earth, at high. It has the highest fatality rate of all the eight-thousanders for every 2 people who summit the mountain, one person dies attempting to. However, this is primarily because most climbers tend to try to ascend to the primary peak of Lhotse, rather than the lowest summit of the mountain.

Miura skied 6,600 feet ( 2000 m ) in 2 minutes and 20 seconds and fell 1320 feet down the steep Lhotse face from the Yellow Band just below the South Col. He used a large parachute to slow his descent . He came to a full stop just 250 ft. from the edge of the crevasse . The ski descent was the objective of The Japanese Everest Skiing Expedition 1970 . Six members of this expedition died . At the same time , another independent Japanese expedition ( called The Japanese Mount Everest Expedition 1970 ) undertook a combined ascent of ( a ) the normal route ( including Naomi Uemura who made the summit ) and ( b ) the first attempt at the South - West Face ( this is the tall black face on the movie poster with the Y - shaped snowy gully ) .

Work could mean a variety of settings such as a small store or a factory. - \\"Industrial complex\\" refers to an area where multiple industrial facilities or businesses are located, which may or may not have office buildings. Though some industrial complexes contain office buildings, they are typically more associated with manufacturing or production facilities. - \\"New York\\" could refer to either New York City or New York state, but given that it is a more specific location, it may not be the most suitable answer for a general question. Nonetheless, it is true that New York City does contain many office buildings. - \\"Suburbia\\" generally refers to residential suburban neighborhoods, which are not primarily known for having multiple office buildings. While it is possible to find some office buildings in suburbs, they are typically far less concentrated than in city centers.

Summarize this article: by Fox News | September 26, 2011 If Mitt Romney was in New York City Monday to kiss the ring of business mogul Donald Trump, he didn't seem to want the press to capture his reaction afterwards. According to Fox News producer Nicole Busch, Romney's director of operations stood with the media the entire time they waited to catch a glimpse of the former Massachusetts Governor...only to tell reporters and cameras after an hour that Romney had already come and went. \\"Chicken Mitt!!\\" DNC spokesperson Brad Woodhouse wrote in a rapid fire email to reporters upon learning the Romney aide had misled the press while the candidate departed another exit. \\"Bwok-Bwok!\\" he continued. But in contrast to the DNC's caricature of Romney's actions, Donald Trump told Fox News Channel anchor Neil Cavuto afterwards that he and Romney had a \\"really had a great hour together\\" and that he was \\"impressed by certain things\\" Romney said during their meeting. \\"I thought he was very good at the debate, I think he did a good job, I did tell him that,\\" Trump said, although he has yet to endorse a candidate. Mitt Romney requested the one-on-one meeting with Donald Trump, their first since Romney declared a run for the Oval Office; fellow Republican hopefuls Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry have already met with the reality television host. Herman Cain has a meeting scheduled next week. In the interview with Cavuto, Trump walked back from less than flattering comments he has made about Romney in the past. \\"Mitt Romney is a basically small business guy, if you really think about it,\\" Trump said of his potential rival in April as he pondered the idea of a presidential run. \\"He was a hedge fund. He was a fund guy. He walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn't create. He worked there. He didn't create it.\\" The hither-to lack of fuzzy feelings between the two men did not stop the DNC from trying to lump the two men together in a web video released Monday morning, entitled \\"Trump, Romney: You're Fired!\\" You can watch the DNC web video here. ||||| Fresh off a victory in the Michigan straw poll, Mitt Romney will be reaching out to another sizable part of the Republican base Monday -- Donald Trump Romney will be meeting with His Trumpness in New York on Monday afternoon, becoming the latest GOP presidential aspirant to court the developer/TV host/former potential candidate/birth certificate investigator. Rick Perry dined with Trump earlier this month at pricey, exclusive Jean-Georges in Manhattan. (You might recall that in June, Trump and Sarah Palin shared some slices of pizza in Times Square . Read into that what you will.) Michele Bachmann has also met with the Donald and plans to do so again.Why court the blessings of Trump? That’s a good question. Well, for one thing, there are still those out there who believe Trump should be president of the United States. There’s a whole website and everything. (It includes items such as “Trump Answers Boy’s Prayer for New Bike.”) For another, say what you will about the man, but he has a platform. He can pretty much show up on Piers Morgan ’s CNN show or Fox News just about whenever he likes. (And don’t forget “Celebrity Apprentice” on NBC . Don’t worry. He’s not going to let you forget it.) Third, he has money. And he knows other people with money. Presidential candidates like money.But Democrats are just as eager to associate Trump with the GOP, as the candidates seem to be to meet with him. Part of it is that it makes Perry, Romney and the like look a little less, well, serious. The other is that Trump is sort of the epitome of the fatcatness that Democrats argue the GOP protects. (This is what GOP calls \\"class warfare.\\")The Democratic National Committee, in fact, has released a video in advance of the Romney-Trump summit, imaginatively titled “You’re Fired” that paints both men as uber-capitalists who care little about the middle-class, education, Medicare or Social Security.Romney is on a small roll. He was widely viewed as handily winning the Fox News- Google debate Thursday night while his top rival, Perry, turned in a shaky performance. Then Perry lost a Florida straw poll he had been expected to win to Herman Cain . On Sunday, Romney trounced Perry and all others in a straw poll in his home state of Michigan.But can he win the coveted Trump endorsement? If there’s one thing to be sure of, it’s that Trump will keep America in suspense as long as possible before answering that question. |||||","completion":"Mitt Romney, a man who wants to be president, visited Donald Trump, a famous businessman, to talk in New York City.

Please write a short summary for the following article: W. Va. man mauled by pit bull while aiding dying neighbor Two West Virginia men are dead and a pit bull is under quarantine after the dog’s owner suffered an apparent heart attack Sunday night and the animal attacked a neighbor who tried to help, police said. David Wallace, 63, was entertaining a friend at his Wheeling home at 8:50 p.m. when he started to suffer from what appears to be a heart attack, police Sgt. Gregg McKenzie told the Daily News on Wednesday. Wallace lived in an upstairs apartment of a makeshift duplex and his guest rushed downstairs to ask his neighbor, Roy Higgenbotham Jr., 62, for help. Higgenbotham immediately called 911 and ran upstairs, McKenzie said. But when he tried to help Wallace, the normally docile pit bull became agitated and attacked Higgenbothem’s arms and upper torso, McKenzie said. “The dog was not viciously attacking people in the street,” he said. “This was an isolated incident. All indications are, he was just being a good guard dog and protecting his owner and residence.” The two men were transported to a hospital and died about 40 minutes later, but police have not confirmed the cause of death for either men, McKenzie said. Police are awaiting the results of an autopsy and toxicology tests. The pit bull may not have caused Higgenbotham’s death, McKenzie said. “He may have had a pre-existing medical condition,” he said. The woman who was visiting Wallace’s home escaped by crawling out of the second story window. The fire department provided a ladder so she could get down, McKenzie said. The incident is still under investigation. The 3-year-old pit bull remains under quarantine at Ohio County Animal Control in Triadelphia, W.Va. A representative was not immediately available Wednesday morning to discuss the animal’s condition. A neighbor and eyewitness, Beth Patsch, told WTRF-TV that the female pit bull terrier is normally sedate, but likely became confused when she saw her owner in pain. “It seems like she was protecting him from the person trying to resuscitate him,” Patsch told the TV station. “She was always wonderful. They had actually had (the dog) and her mother, and her mother had just passed in the fall, I believe, and this was the puppy. They’ve had her since she was tiny, tiny and never a problem.” ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: A volcano is a vent through which molten rock and gas escape from a magma chamber. Volcanoes differ in many features, such as height, shape, and slope steepness. Some volcanoes are tall cones, and others are just cracks in the ground ( Figure below ). As you might expect, the shape of a volcano is related to the composition of its magma. The three types of volcanoes are composite, shield, and cinder cones. Q: What are the 3 types of volcanoes? A: A:","completion":"The three types of volcanoes, as mentioned in the given paragraph, are composite, shield, and cinder cone volcanoes. These different types of volcanoes showcase distinct features, shapes, and eruption patterns, which are influenced by the composition of their magma. 1. Composite volcanoes, also known as stratovolcanoes, are characterized by their large, symmetrical, conical shapes. These types of volcanoes have steep slopes and can reach great heights. Their magma composition primarily consists of viscous, silica-rich lava, which can lead to explosive eruptions. The erupted material often includes tephra (solid fragments) and pyroclastic flows (fast-moving currents of hot gas and volcanic matter). Composite volcanoes form through alternating layers of lava flows and volcanic debris during multiple eruptions over time. Some well-known composite volcanoes include Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Vesuvius in Italy, and Mount St. Helens in the United States. 2. Shield volcanoes are characterized by their broad, gently sloping shapes, with their slopes resembling a warrior's shield. These volcanoes typically have non-explosive eruptions due to their magma composition, which is mainly composed of low-viscosity, low-silica basaltic lava that can easily flow over great distances. This type of lava creates extensive lava fields and gently sloping shield volcanoes over time. As the lava flows cool and solidify, the shield volcano's structure is built up in layers. Some famous shield volcanoes include Mauna Loa and Kilauea located on the Big Island of Hawaii. 3. Cinder cone volcanoes, also known as scoria cones, are the smallest and simplest of the three types. They are characterized by their steep, conical shapes, and smaller size compared to composite and shield volcanoes. These volcanoes are formed from the eruption of gas-charged, basaltic magma, which produces a volcaniclastic material called cinders or scoria. As the cinders accumulate around the vent, they eventually form the conical shape of a cinder cone volcano. Cinder cone volcanoes are often found on the flanks of larger volcanoes, and their eruptions generally don't last long. A well-known example of a cinder cone is Paricutín in Mexico, which grew rapidly from a cornfield to a 1,200-foot tall volcano between 1943 and 1952. In summary, the three types of volcanoes are composite, shield, and cinder cones, each displaying distinct features, shapes, and eruption styles based on the composition of their magma."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 1: She pulled at it but the head was barbed. - This sentence indicates that she attempted to pull \\"it\\" (presumably an object), but the object has a barbed head, which might imply that her attempt was unsuccessful or difficult. Sentence 2: She tugged at it. - This sentence simply states that she exerted a pulling force on the object. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Yes - This option implies that if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 must also be true. The action of pulling (as mentioned in Sentence 1) can be interpreted as a form of tugging. Therefore, if she did try to pull at the object in Sentence 1, it would mean she tugged at it as well, making Sentence 2 true. B. It is not possible to tell - This option implies that the information provided in Sentence 1 is not sufficient to draw a conclusion about the truth of Sentence 2. C. No - This option implies that if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 must not be true. However, as discussed earlier, if she pulled the object in Sentence 1, it suggests she tugged at it, making Sentence 2 true. Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is: A.

Question: When were the September 11 attacks? Movie title: W. Movie plot: George W. Bush dreams of being a baseball player and is in the empty stadium. In 1966, Bush endures an initiation by his fellow Yale University students as a Delta Kappa Epsilon pledge. During the hazing, Bush successfully recalls the names and nicknames of many of the fraternity members, and states that his family's political legacy is one in which he has no interest. After Bush is jailed in New Jersey for rowdiness following a football game, his father, George H. W. Bush states that he will help Bush for the last time. Following his graduation from Yale, Bush takes a job at an oil patch back in Texas, but he quits after a few weeks. In 1972, \\"Junior\\" reveals his real aspirations in a father-son talk: working in professional baseball. Bush is accepted into Harvard Business School with the help of his father. After heavy drinking, Bush crashes his car into his family estate and challenges his father to a fistfight. His brother, Jeb, stops the fight. In 1977, Bush announces he will run for Congress. At a barbecue, Bush meets his future wife, Laura Lane Welch. During a debate, Bush is criticized by his Democratic opponent, Kent Hance, who says that Bush is not a real Texan and has spent campaign contributions to throw an alcohol-fueled party for underage Texas Tech University students. Bush does poorly in the debate and loses the election, but with the highest number of votes for a Republican candidate in the state's history. In 1986, Bush becomes a born-again Christian, gives up alcohol, and mends his relationship with his father. The elder Bush invites him to assist with what becomes his 1988 presidential campaign, although Bush himself suspects that he only was asked because Jeb was busy. Bush's political advisor, Karl Rove, tells him that he has the potential to make a name for himself. Bush becomes a front office executive of the Texas Rangers baseball team, while his father oversees the victory of the Gulf War. Although Allied forces win the war within 100 hours, the elder Bush decides not to invade Iraq...

Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that \\"it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers\\". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final. He sang \\"Tears in Heaven\\" by Eric Clapton; judge Holden told him he had \\"a gift from God in [his] voice\\". At the final on 30 May, he again sang \\"Pie Jesu\\".

Read this and answer the question Hayek's principal investigations in economics concerned capital, money, and the business cycle. Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility to the value of money in his Theory of Money and Credit (1912), in which he also proposed an explanation for \\"industrial fluctuations\\" based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the \\"Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle\\". Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle. There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates. Hayek claimed that \\"the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process\\".

Write a summary based on this article: [Editor’s note: This item has been updated since it was originally posted.] A statement released Wednesday evening by the family Amber Vinson, one of two Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas nurses diagnosed with Ebola, says she appears to be free of the disease. That was news to a spokesperson for Emory University Hospital, to which Vinson was transferred one week ago. “Amber is steadily regaining her strength and her spirits are high,” says the statement sent to media by Steven Jumper of the Washington, D.C.-based PR firm Ghost Note Agency. “We are overjoyed to announce that, as of yesterday evening, officials at Emory University Hospital and the Centers for Disease Control are no longer able to detect virus in her body. She has also been approved for transfer from isolation. Amber remains under treatment within Emory’s Serious Communicable Diseases Unit.” When reached by The Dallas Morning News Wednesday evening, Emory spokesperson Janet Christenbury said she was “not aware of that at all.” She said she would provide an update as soon possible. Jason McDonald, spokesperson for the CDC, says he is “not aware of any test results.” He hopes to have an update tomorrow. “Healthcare provider will determine by diagnostic whether a patient is free of Ebola virus,” he says via email. “We have criteria we ask medical staff to meet but the determination is made by medical care provider.” Previously, Vinson’s family has not allowed Emory or the CDC to comment on Vinson’s condition. “Amber and our family are ecstatic to receive this latest report on her condition,” said Vinson’s mother Debra Berry in the statement provided by the PR agency, which has been updating the media about Vinson’s condition. “We all know that further treatment will be necessary as Amber continues to regain strength, but these latest developments have truly answered prayers and bring our family one step closer to reuniting with her at home.” Meanwhile, closer to home, the number of people being monitored for Ebola continues to shrink. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 108 people are “still being actively monitored” for the diseases, while 66 others have been cleared. And most of those are, like Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, health-care workers at Presbyterian who had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan during his two visits to the hospital. “As the graph shows, the number of people at possible risk for contracting Ebola is decreasing each day,” said Dr. Lyle Peterson, the senior CDC official in Dallas, in a prepared statement. “Although we are not out of the woods yet, it is very encouraging we have not seen any other cases. This has been an incredible team effort and we are grateful to Mayor Rawlings and Judge Jenkins for their support.” Added Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, “Working together we are winning the war on Ebola, and every day we are closer to successfully accomplishing our mission.” “There are still more hurdles to overcome, but we’ve reached a significant milestone in this difficult journey,” said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings in a prepared statement. “I’m grateful that these 66 brave people have completed the monitoring period, and I look forward to the day when the others finish their monitoring periods as well.” 10.22.14 Graph Contact Monitoring ||||| A statement quotes Vinson's mother, Debra Berry, as saying that the news has \\"truly answered prayers.\\" Dallas nurse Amber Vinson is seen smiling in her Atlanta hospital room in a photo released by her family.

Wednesday night, Fort Worth's religious communities gathered to pray for the well-being of those tormented by Ebola, both in Texas and abroad. Their timing was unintentionally spot-on. One week after Dallas nurse Amber Vinson had been diagnosed with Ebola, we learned Wednesday the CDC declared her to be Ebola-free. A just-released photo of Vinson speaks volumes. She's smiling, taking a \\"selfie\\" from her hospital bed in Atlanta. Her mother Debra Berry issued a statement. It reads, in part: \\"We all know that further treatment will be necessary as Amber continues to regain strength, but these latest developments have truly answered prayers and bring our family one step closer to reuniting with her at home.\\" Vinson should soon be moved out of isolation. The second Dallas nurse fighting Ebola, Nina Pham, was upgraded Wednesday to \\"good\\" condition. The Nolan Catholic High School and TCU graduate warmed hearts last week as she appeared in a video, upbeat, preparing to be transported from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. We also learned Wednesday that Pham's beloved dog, Bentley, had tested negative for Ebola. He'll undergo one more test before his 21-day quarantine ends, and if all goes well, he should be reunited with Pham when she recovers. \\"We grieve for Nina Pham and for Amber and their families,\\" said Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price at the vigil. \\"Both of them are going to be fine.\\" Some back at home believe Vinson's news bodes well for Pham, too. \\"We believe there will be more good news coming,\\" said Rev.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach.

This breed is known for its distinctive coat, which resembles that of its wild counterparts, and its intelligent, active and energetic nature. Facts relevant to the question: 1. Bengal cats, like all cats, are obligate carnivores. This means that they require a diet primarily based on animal proteins to provide the essential nutrients they need. 2. Cats must consume certain amino acids, vitamins, and minerals from animal sources that are not found or are insufficient in plant-based diets. For example, cats require taurine, an amino acid found mainly in meat, to maintain healthy heart function and eyesight. A deficiency in taurine can lead to severe health problems. 3. Pancakes are typically made from flour, eggs, milk, and other ingredients. They are not a complete source of nutrition for Bengal cats and lack the necessary nutrients derived from animal proteins. 4. Feeding a Bengal cat a diet consisting of only pancakes can lead to malnutrition and serious health issues due to nutrient deficiencies.

Those on the other side, however, held little hope a clone could never truly recreate a pet, many simply didn't wish to go against the natural law of life and death.

It is revealed that Sam can travel back to any time and location during his lifetime (occupying his body of that time in his life), needing only to concentrate on where and when he wishes to arrive. He has helped the local police capture criminals under the guise of being a psychic. We learn that Sam pays his sister's rent and buys her groceries, and that she rarely leaves the apartment and lives in squalor in a run-down section of Detroit.That night, Elizabeth (Sarah Habel), the sister of Sam's murdered girlfriend Rebecca (Mia Serafino), arrives at Sam's apartment. She believes that the man about to be executed for her sister's murder, Lonnie Flennonds (Richard Wilkinson), is innocent, and she offers to pay Sam to find the real murderer. Sam turns her down, but goes to speak with the man who tutored him on time travel, Goldburg (Kevin Yon), who reminds him of the cardinal rules: he's not to alter his own personal past, nor travel in time with his body left unsupervised. We learn that a fire that claimed the lives of Sam and Jenna's parents had claimed Jenna's life, but Sam altered time so that their parents died instead. After Goldburg's departure, their buxom bartender Vicki (Melissa Jones) seductively offers Sam a buttery nipple; he and Vicki have sex, but upon seeing Rebecca's photo, he cannot continue.Sam changes his mind and agrees to help Elizabeth out.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Make a tracing table.","completion":"To accomplish the goal of making a tracing table, also known as a lightbox, follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather materials and tools: - A wooden or plastic container (could be a shallow box or drawer) will serve as the base for your tracing table. The size of the box will depend on the desired size of your tracing table. - A sheet of plexiglass or clear, sturdy plastic - this will serve as the top surface where you'll place your drawings or designs to trace. - LED strip lights or a small LED lamp - these will provide the light source for your tracing table. - Frosted white or translucent paper or film - this will help distribute light evenly across the top surface. - Ruler, pencil, and masking tape - Wood glue, nails, or screws (depending on the material of your base) - Drill and drill bits - Jigsaw (optional) - Sandpaper - Protective eyewear and gloves 2. Measure and cut the plexiglass or plastic sheet: - Measure the inner dimensions of your container and cut the plexiglass sheet to match using a jigsaw or have it cut at your local hardware store. Make sure to leave a small gap (approximately 1/8 inch) around the edges for easy installation and removal. - Sand the edges of the cut sheet to remove any sharp edges. 3. Prepare the light source: - If using LED strip lights, measure the interior surface of the container base and cut the LED strips accordingly. Connect the cut LED strips in series or parallel, depending on your desired brightness and voltage requirements. - If using a small LED lamp, choose a position inside the container that will provide even light distribution. 4. Install the LED lights: - Attach the LED strip lights or lamp to the inside of the container using glue or mounting hardware. Make sure the lights are secure and the wiring is neatly organized. - Drill a hole in one of the container's sides to accommodate the power cord and any connectors. This will allow you to plug in the lights externally. 5. Install the frosted white or translucent paper or film: - Cut the frosted paper or film to fit the interior dimensions of the container. - Secure the paper or film in place using masking tape, ensuring it is smooth and wrinkle-free. This layer will help diffuse the light for more even illumination on the work surface. 6. Place the plexiglass or plastic sheet on top: - Carefully place the cut plexiglass or plastic sheet on top of the container, nesting it within the edges. Make sure the sheet is clean and free from dust or smudges for the best tracing results. 7. Test your tracing table: - Plug in your LED lights and turn on the tracing table. Place a reference image on the surface, and put a blank sheet of paper on top. You should be able to see the reference image through the blank sheet, allowing you to trace the design easily. 8. Secure the plexiglass sheet (optional): - If you want to secure the top sheet in place, you can use wood glue, nails, or screws, depending on the material of your container. Make sure not to overtighten the screws or apply too much pressure, as this could crack or damage the plexiglass. Congratulations! You've successfully made a tracing table or lightbox that you can use for your various tracing, design, and artistic needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. Nate and Andy were two zoologists. They have been studying the characteristics of nocturnal and diurnal animals. Andy studied nocturnal animals, while Nate studied diurnal animals. Which zoologist learned less about bats? The answer is:","completion":"Nate would have learned less about bats because he studied diurnal animals. Diurnal animals are active during the day and sleep at night, which is the opposite behavior of bats. Bats are nocturnal animals, meaning they are active at night and sleep during the day, so Andy who studied nocturnal animals would have learned more about bats."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person with whose help Swift modelled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \\"Rising Stars\\" campaign? , can you please find it? Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \\"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career.

The answer is:","completion":"Smith's Magazine and Fit Pregnancy are both examples of print media, specifically falling under the category of magazines. Print media, as the name suggests, refers to those forms of media that are primarily transmitted and disseminated through physical means, such as books, newspapers, and magazines. Print media has been a significant method of communication and information dissemination for centuries, with its roots dating back to the invention of the Gutenberg printing press in the 15th century. Smith's Magazine, as the name implies, is a magazine that covers a variety of topics, often focusing on current events, pop culture, fashion, and lifestyle. It features interviews, informative articles, and well-researched stories that appeal to a diverse readership. The magazine covers both national and international news, often through the lens of the magazine's unique perspective. Smith's Magazine is available in both print and digital formats, which means that subscribers can either receive the physical magazine in their mailboxes or access the content online through a website or app. Fit Pregnancy, on the other hand, specifically caters to pregnant women and new mothers, addressing their unique needs and concerns during this life stage. The magazine provides articles and resources on prenatal and postnatal care, nutrition, fitness, fashion, and lifestyle tips specifically tailored for pregnant women and new mothers. This niche focus helps the magazine cater to its target audience more effectively, offering specialized information that its readers are unlikely to find in general-purpose magazines. Both Smith's Magazine and Fit Pregnancy share the essential characteristics of magazines as a type of print media: they are periodical publications featuring informative and engaging content, typically with a mix of written articles, images, and sometimes interactive elements. Magazines cater to specific interests and groups, allowing them to reach dedicated audiences who are interested in their content. In summary, Smith's Magazine and Fit Pregnancy are both types of print media, with each magazine representing different subject matter and target audiences. While Smith's Magazine focuses on a broader array of topics such as current events, pop culture, and lifestyle, Fit Pregnancy is specifically aimed at pregnant women and new mothers, providing information and resources relevant to their needs. Both magazines offer their readers a mix of articles, images, and sometimes interactive content, adhering to the basic format of magazine publishing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is distinct from rice starch, which is usually produced by steeping rice in lye. Rice flour is a particularly good substitute for wheat flour, which irritates the digestive system of some people. Rice flour is also used as a thickening agent in recipes that are refrigerated or frozen since it inhibits liquid separation. OPT: [I] no. [II] yes. Is this statement correct \\"is rice powder and rice flour the same\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"is rice powder and rice flour the same\\" is correct. Rice flour and rice powder are two terms used interchangeably to describe the same product. Both are made from finely milled rice grains and have similar properties and uses in cooking and baking. Rice flour is known for its versatility as a substitute for wheat flour in many recipes, especially for people experiencing gluten intolerance or celiac disease. There are different types of rice flour available based on the type of rice used for milling. These include: 1. White Rice Flour: Made from finely milled white rice, this is the most common type of rice flour. It has a mild, neutral taste and can easily be incorporated into various recipes. 2. Brown Rice Flour: Brown rice flour is prepared using unpolished brown rice, which retains the bran and germ layers. It has a nuttier flavor and higher nutritional content compared to white rice flour. 3. Glutinous Rice Flour: Also known as sticky rice flour or sweet rice flour, this type is made from short-grain glutinous rice, which is starchier than other varieties. Glutinous rice flour is commonly used in Asian desserts and dishes requiring a sticky, chewy texture. Rice flour applications and benefits: 1. Gluten-Free Baking: As a gluten-free alternative to wheat flour, rice flour can be used in baking recipes like bread, pancakes, waffles, muffins, cookies, and cakes. It may require blending with other flours or modifying the recipe to achieve the desired texture. 2. Thickening Agent: Rice flour serves as an excellent thickening agent for sauces, gravies, and soups. Since it does not form lumps and dissolves easily, it is preferred over wheat flour for thickening purposes in many cuisines. 3. Coating for Frying: Rice flour can be used as a coating for deep frying or pan-frying food items, providing a crispy, golden-brown crust. 4. Noodle Making: Rice flour is a primary ingredient in making gluten-free noodles, such as Vietnamese rice noodles and Japanese udon noodles. As a versatile, gluten-free alternative to wheat flour, rice flour (also known as rice powder) offers a suitable option for those with dietary restrictions or individuals seeking new flavors and textures in their recipes. Its wide range of applications and benefits make rice flour an essential ingredient in many culinary traditions around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When you do wash your hair 24 to 48 hours prior, make sure that you only use shampoo. Conditioner will prevent the dye from adhering. Put on a shirt that you won't mind staining, then wrap an old towel or a plastic cape around your shoulders. Coat your hairline, the tips of your ears, and the back of your neck with petroleum jelly. Finally, pull on a pair of plastic gloves. Work in an area that is easy to clean, such as a bathroom or kitchen. If you are worried about staining the counters or floors, cover them with newspaper, paper bags, or plastic bags. It is easier to dye your hair in layers .5–1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) thick rather than in sections. Part your hair across the back of your head at about ear-level. Pull everything above the part into a bun. Secure the bun with a claw-clip. It'll be the easier to remove and replace. If you have very thick hair, you may want to part it even lower so that you are working with thinner sections. If your hair is too short to pull into a bun, use clips. If you have chin-length or shorter hair, you may not have to do this step at all. Some dyes come in a kit that already include the dye and developer. For other dyes, you must purchase the developer separately. Follow the instructions that came with the dye to find out how you should mix them. You can mix the dye in the squeeze bottles that came in the kit, or you can mix it in a non-metal bowl. If you are lightening your hair, add 1 to 3 packets of toner. The more packets you use, the ashier the final color will be. If you can't find packets of toner, don't worry; you can wash your hair with purple shampoo afterwards to remove brassy hints. Take a thin strand of hair from an inconspicuous area, such as your nape, and apply the dye to it. Cover the strand with plastic wrap, and let the dye sit for the time recommended on the bottle. Rinse the dye out with cool water, then let it dry. You don't have to use conditioner for this since this is just a strand test. Although not absolutely necessary, strand tests are highly recommended because the color may come out differently from what you expect. If the dye did not turn out the way you wanted it, you’ll have to buy a different color.","completion":"The article provides guidelines for dyeing hair at home while ensuring minimal damage and maximizing color adherence.

Please briefly summarize this news article: CVS customers say unauthorized prescription refills still occur Problem was, De Maria's son had given no such instructions, and the prescription was for a temporary skin problem, not any type of chronic condition. No refills were needed. Even worse for CVS: De Maria, 60, works in the drug industry and knows a thing or two about how the game gets played. \\"These automatic refills have become a standard industry practice,\\" she told me. \\"They have become very prevalent.\\" Federal and state authorities launched investigations into unauthorized refills after I wrote columns about how CVS and other drugstores were routinely signing up customers for automatic refills without their approval. CVS, for its part, blamed the practice on rogue drugstore managers and insisted that the company's official policy was that customers are always asked before being enrolled in ReadyFill, the chain's refill program. But I've obtained company documents showing that CVS pharmacists are expected to enroll at least 40% of patients into ReadyFill. Failure to do so, pharmacists say, can result in reduced compensation or even being fired. Some CVS pharmacists have told me that, because of the investigations, company managers quietly told them to ease up on the automatic refills. But recent reports of people still being enrolled in ReadyFill without approval indicate that not all stores have gotten the message. Indianapolis resident Bill Rainsberger, 55, said he was notified by his local CVS recently that a refill was ready for a medicine he'd already stopped taking. \\"I never, ever signed up for automatic refills,\\" he said. \\"I didn't even know they had such a thing.\\" Mike DeAngelis, a CVS spokesman, declined to answer when I asked what steps the company has taken to reduce incidents of people being enrolled in ReadyFill without their permission. He said only that customers can call (800) SHOP-CVS, or (800) 746-7287, to report any prescription-related problems. De Maria works as a sales rep for a leading drug company. After she received the calls from CVS about her 23-year-old son's prescription being refilled, she headed straight to the pharmacy. She said she asked a worker how her son had been enrolled in ReadyFill. The worker insisted that he must have asked to be included in the program. \\"So I told her to show me the proof that he'd signed up,\\" De Maria recalled. \\"Show me anything that proves this. She couldn't do it.\\" De Maria told me that pharmacies and prescription benefit managers — the companies that manage drug benefits for insurers and employers — have realized there's a lot of money to be made from automatic refills. \\"They bill insurers for it, they get paid for it,\\" she said. \\"And most of the time the prescription isn't picked up and it goes back on the shelf, although the insurer might not be reimbursed.\\" At CVS, De Maria said, the store's pharmacist eventually got involved and agreed to remove her son from ReadyFill and reverse the prescription so that her insurer would be paid back. \\"As the pharmacist was fixing things, I told her I couldn't believe that they were still doing this,\\" De Maria said. \\"Hadn't they had enough negative press?\\" What did the pharmacist say? Summary:","completion":"A growing number of CVS customers have raised concerns about unauthorized prescription refills, despite the company's claims to the contrary. Federal and state authorities even launched investigations into the widespread accusations. While CVS has blamed this practice on rogue store managers, evidence suggests that pharmacists are expected to enroll at least 40% of patients into ReadyFill, the chain's refill program. CVS pharmacists have reported that failing to do so would result in reduced compensation or job termination, and that company managers have asked them to be less aggressive in automatic refills due to the investigations. However, recent cases show that customers continue to be enrolled in ReadyFill without their consent. One notable case involves De Maria, an industry insider who works as a sales rep for a major drug company. After receiving calls about her son's prescription refill - a temporary medication for a skin problem - she criticized the scheme. According to De Maria, pharmacies and prescription benefit managers have been benefitting financially from these automatic refills, which often result in unused medications going back on the shelf while the insurers bear the cost, without being reimbursed most of the time. Despite awareness and public outcry about such practices, it seems that not all CVS stores have adjusted their practices accordingly. The CVS company spokesman, Mike DeAngelis, has not provided insight into what steps the company has taken to prevent people from being enrolled into ReadyFill without their permission."},{"prompt":"Given the background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem.

Write a text based on this summary: bulgarian police chief calls british tv investigation biased Text:","completion":"Title: Bulgarian Police Chief Accuses British TV Investigation of Bias Amid Rising Tensions In a recent statement, the Bulgarian Police Chief has criticized a British TV investigation, calling it biased and claiming that it portrays his country's law enforcement negatively. The ongoing tensions between the two nations have been exacerbated by a series of reports from the British media that have painted the Bulgarian police force in a negative light. The controversy initially emerged following an in-depth report by a prominent UK TV network, which exposed alleged corruption and abuse within the Bulgarian police department. The British investigation, led by renowned journalists, delved into various instances of suspected corruption and misconduct by Bulgarian police officers. It included interviews with victims, whistleblowers, and experts who provided damning evidence of these allegations. The documentary highlighted issues such as the misuse of power by some officers, participation in organized crime, and the systemic cover-up of illegal activities. In response to these accusations, the Bulgarian Police Chief strongly refuted the claims made in the report. He argued that the portrayal of the entire force as corrupt and abusive is unfounded and clearly demonstrates a bias against Bulgaria. He pointed out that any organization, irrespective of its size or influence, may have a few bad apples, but such incidences should not be taken as a blanket representation of the entire police force. Furthermore, the Police Chief stated that the Bulgarian police force comprises dedicated and honest officers who continuously work to protect and serve their country. He expressed his disappointment with the British TV network for failing to incorporate this side of the story in their documentary, which in his opinion, demonstrates an agenda driven approach by the channel to demonize the Bulgarian police force. The TV investigation has undoubtedly caused diplomatic ripples between the UK and Bulgaria. Advocates for the Bulgarian police have called for an apology from the British TV network for their ostensibly one-sided investigation, claiming that it has damaged the reputation of a committed and professional institution. Additionally, they argue that such accusations cast a shadow not only on the police force but also on the entire nation, potentially causing harm to the bilateral relations between the UK and Bulgaria. In the wake of this controversy, both sides have raised their concerns. While the supporters of the British TV investigation maintain that exposing corruption and abuse in any form is essential for a healthy democracy, the Bulgarian authorities argue that the report was incomplete and lacked the essential elements of journalistic integrity. As the story unfolds, it remains to be seen how these allegations and counter-allegations will influence the already tense relationship between the UK and Bulgaria. The British authorities may need to reconsider their approach in investigating similar issues in foreign countries, taking into account the sensitivity of international relations and the potential for affecting diplomatic ties. On the other hand, the Bulgarian authorities must also ensure that any instances of corruption or abuse of power within their police force are addressed promptly and effectively, upholding the rule of law and the trust of their citizens. In conclusion, the Bulgarian Police Chief's accusations of bias against the British TV investigation have sparked a heated debate surrounding journalistic ethics, the portrayal of foreign countries and institutions, and the impact of such reports on international relations.

Adam Farooqui holds a sign as he stands at Zuccotti Park on Wednesday in New York. \\"We need to have a symbolic presence,\\" said Ned Merrill, 52, a blanket draped over his shoulder. He spoke as workers for Brookfield Office Properties, which owns the plaza, maneuvered around the scattered protesters with steam cleaners. The barricades that came down Tuesday were chained together and neatly stacked at the north end of the park. On Tuesday, about 300 protesters filled Zuccotti after the barricades were taken down. Police spokesman Paul Browne said the New York Police Department and Brookfield had been talking about removing the barriers last week. The decision was made to remove them Tuesday because officials felt they were no longer necessary, Browne said. Merrill said it's important for at least a few protesters to be at Zuccotti at all times. He said he's been there from midnight to about 10 a.m. most nights since Dec. 1. \\"Most people in American know that something is wrong,\\" he said. \\"Much of what is wrong is that money owns the political process.\\" Robert Segal, who is 47 and works in a wine store, also spent Tuesday night at Zuccotti. \\"The rest of the world want a place where they can come down and join Occupy Wall Street at critical moments,\\" he said. Tents and sleeping bags have been banned from Zuccotti Park since a Nov. 15 police raid evicted protesters who had been sleeping there since Sept. 17. Merrill said security guards have prevented him from sitting on a piece of plastic foam when he spends the night there. They told him it was considered bedding, he said. On Monday, civil rights groups filed a complaint with the city's buildings department saying the barricades were a violation of city zoning law. The granite plaza a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange is a privately owned public park. It is required to be open 24 hours under city zoning laws. Copyright 2012 The Associated Press.

Here are the steps to solve the equation: 1. Start with the equation: a - 20809 = -20817 2. Your goal is to isolate the variable a on the left side of the equation. As you can see, there is a constant value, which is -20809, that you need to get rid of. To do this, add 20809 to both sides of the equation: a - 20809 + 20809 = -20817 + 20809 Since adding and subtracting the same value from both sides of an equation retains its equivalence, the equation after this step would be: a = -20817 + 20809 3.

Let's break down each sentence to understand why this is the case. Sentence 1: The speaker appears to be struggling with the idea of people who believe in God and love, and advocate for peace and forgiveness, not being able to unite. The sentence reflects an internal conflict within the speaker, as they can intellectually understand why this may be the case, but emotionally, it is difficult for them to accept. Sentence 2: The speaker expresses the belief that people can be hypocritical when they are religious. This sentence indicates the speaker's general opinion about religious individuals—specifically, that they can be hypocritical in their actions compared to their professed beliefs. The connection between the two sentences lies in their focus on the inconsistencies and challenges experienced by religious people. Though the first sentence does not directly entail the second, both sentences are related to religious beliefs and the internal struggles that may arise in reconciling those beliefs with the realities of human interactions. The first sentence expresses a desire for unity among people who share similar beliefs, while the second sentence provides a possible explanation (hypocrisy) for why such unity might not always be achieved.

Answer the following question: Dee and Ann were two cousins. Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which cousin experienced fewer thunderstorms? Hint: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content. Answer:","completion":"Dee, who lived in a coastal town at sea level, likely experienced fewer thunderstorms compared to Ann, who lived in a mountain village at an altitude of 8000 ft. There are several reasons for this difference in thunderstorm frequency and intensity between the two locations. One of the key factors influencing thunderstorm development is the temperature difference between higher and lower altitudes. The higher you go, the cooler the air usually becomes due to a decrease in surface temperature and radiational heating. This relationship is known as the adiabatic lapse rate. When the temperature decreases with altitude, as it typically does, there is a higher likelihood of thunderstorm development. However, there are instances when temperature might actually increase with altitude, causing an inversion. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap, suppressing thunderstorm development. In this case, mountain tops might experience warmer temperatures than the valleys below. While inversions can occur in both coastal and mountainous regions, they are more likely to be associated with the mountain village where Ann lives. The uneven solar heating described in the paragraph also has an impact on the temperature and moisture gradients (frontogenesis) that contribute to the formation of thunderstorms. Coastal towns, like where Dee lives, tend to have more consistent temperature and moisture profiles due to the moderating influence of the nearby ocean. This ocean-driven stability reduces the likelihood of strong thunderstorm development. On the other hand, mountain villages, like where Ann lives, can have much more varied temperature and moisture profiles due to the complex topography. This variability can give rise to a higher potential for thunderstorm formation. Lastly, local-scale temperature differences caused by the different characteristics of Earth's surfaces (e.g., reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content) can also influence the formation of thunderstorms. Coastal towns usually have a more uniform surface, while mountainous regions have more diverse surface characteristics. This greater diversity in the landscape of mountain villages can often lead to a higher frequency of thunderstorms compared to coastal towns. In conclusion, Dee, who lived at sea level in a coastal town, experienced fewer thunderstorms than Ann, who lived in a mountain village at an altitude of 8000 ft. This difference is primarily due to the combination of factors related to altitude, temperature profiles, and local surface characteristics."},{"prompt":"Obrowo Gmina Miastko - Obrowo [ɔˈbrɔvɔ] (Kashubian: Òbrowò) is a village in Gmina Miastko Bytów County Pomeranian Voivodeship in northern Poland.

Taste in music: Showing a preference for or regularly consuming music genres that are primarily linked to white American culture, such as rock, country, or electronic music, over genres traditionally tied to African-American culture like hip-hop, R&B, or jazz. 4. Academic achievement: Pursuing higher education or displaying a strong commitment to academic success, which may sometimes be seen by some members of the black community as embracing a traditionally \\"white\\" value system or distancing oneself from their own cultural background. It is important to note that these are generalized stereotypes of both black and white Americans and may not represent the actual behavior or preferences of individuals. Additionally, the concept of \\"acting white\\" is subjective and can vary from one person's perception to another's. The notion of \\"acting white\\" has been critiqued by scholars and commentators for perpetuating harmful stereotypes, and it oversimplifies the complex and diverse experiences of both black and white people in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:But with the party reduced from 57 MPs to just eight - and the loss of ex-ministers such as Vince Cable, Norman Baker, David Laws and Danny Alexander - here are the remaining MPs: Former Lib Dem president Tim Farron has retained his Westmorland and Lonsdale seat. He has held the seat since 2005, when he ended a 95-year rule by the Conservative Party. Though on Friday he saw his majority slide by 3,315 to 8,949, from 60% to 51.5%. At the Lib Dem conference in March, Mr Farron - seen by some as a frontrunner to succeed Nick Clegg - was quoted in the Mail on Sunday suggesting the party's brand would be tainted for a generation by governing with the Conservatives. Asked if he would stand to replace Mr Clegg if he was no longer leader, Mr Farron said it would be \\"foolish and disloyal\\" to consider a post-election leadership bid. Mr Farron was elected as the party's president in November 2010, winning 53% of the vote and taking over the role in January 2011. He was re-elected unopposed in autumn 2012, until handing over the role at the beginning of January 2015 to Baroness Brinton. A long-standing Norwich City supporter, Norman Lamb served first as chief parliamentary adviser to Nick Clegg following the 2010 general election and then as a junior minister at the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, before he was promoted to minister of state for care and support at the Department of Health. In January 2015, he was appointed to the Lib Dem general election cabinet as the party's health spokesperson. On Friday, he told BBC Radio Norfolk: \\"I will think carefully about how I can best serve my party\\". Mr Lamb has served as Norfolk North's MP since 2001. The son of Hubert Lamb, a leading climatologist, he studied law at Leicester University and, after working as a parliamentary assistant for a Labour MP, built a career as a litigation solicitor, ultimately specialising in employment law. He was partner of Steeles Solicitors and is the author of 'Remedies in the Employment Tribunal'. Greg Mulholland held his Leeds North West seat, where he has been MP since 2005. Shortly before Mr Clegg's resignation as party leader on Friday, Mr Mulholland ruled himself out of the leadership contest. When asked, he told ITV News: \\"No. Very easy answer...My priority is rebuilding [the party] locally.\\" Following Mr Clegg's resignation later on Friday, Mr Mulholland said on Twitter: \\"The 2010 failure to ensure no Liberal Democrat MP voted against a rise in [student tuition] fees was catastrophic. Now we need a leader who voted against.\\" Mr Mulholland was one of the Lib Dems who voted against a fee rise (see the full list of how the Lib Dems voted here). He continued on Twitter: \\"In 2010 the party made the right decision to go into Coalition. Then the leadership made 3 fatal errors 1. fees 2. NHS Act 3. bedroom tax. \\"It really is time for a realignment of British politics & a voting system that does not grotesquely distort & disenfranchise.\\" MP for Southport since 2005, John Pugh held on to his seat, despite losing 8,055 votes. Winning with a reduced majority, he said on Friday that it was time for the party to reflect on how it moves forward after devastating losses across the country. Mr Pugh has previously served as shadow spokesman for transport and health, and, after the election of Nick Clegg as party leader, he worked with Vince Cable as shadow Treasury spokesman. With the formation of the coalition in 2010 he was appointed as co-chairman of the Liberal Democrat parliamentary committee for health and social care, a position he relinquished at the end of 2013 to focus on producing a report examining the social and economic issues facing the north. Born in Liverpool, he graduated in philosophy from Durham University before entering the teaching profession - where he taught in the state and independent sectors and was head of philosophy and religious studies at Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby, prior to his election. Mark Williams is the only Liberal Democrats MP in Wales, after successfully holding on to his seat in the Ceredigion constituency. Mr Williams was appointed to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee in 2005 before becoming the Liberal Democrat spokesman for Wales, and at varying times has been spokesman on schools and higher education. Born in Hertford and educated at Aberystwyth University, Mr Williams worked for the Liberal MP for Ceredigion, Geraint Howells, before becoming a research assistant to Liberal Peers in the House of Lords. He later worked as a primary school teacher and deputy head teacher before being elected to parliament in 2005. Alistair Carmichael was the only Lib Dem MP to survive the SNP landslide in Scotland - 10 others lost their seats. Though his Orkney and Shetland seat was considered to be one of the party's safest, his majority was cut from 9,928 to 817, with a 23.9% swing to the SNP. The safety of his seat has previously led to speculation that the former Scottish secretary could be a potential successor to Mr Clegg. However, in February he appeared to rule out any bid for the leadership. When asked whether he would like to lead the party, Mr Carmichael said: \\"No. There's no vacancy and I have the constituency that is furthest away from London. \\"I have got a family that still includes school age children. And the commitment that it takes to be party leader in modern politics is enormous. At the party conference in March, he said liberalism was needed \\"more than ever\\". He told the conference: \\"In a world where nationalism and populism can seem like attractive options - a world where the power of the state and corporate interests can seem to overwhelm the rights and freedoms of the individual - in a world like that liberalism is needed more than ever before and more than ever before our country needs Liberal Democrat influence in government. Liberal Democrat Tom Brake was the only party member to hold his seat in London, in Carshalton and Wallington, beating Tory rival Matthew Maxwell Scott by 1,500 votes. In every other London seat, the capital is now in the hands of either Labour or the Conservatives. Mr Brake has held his seat since 1997, when he overturned a Tory majority. In September 2012, he was appointed to his first ministerial position as deputy leader of the House of Commons, having been appointed a privy counsellor in June 2011. Following Mr Clegg's resignation, Mr Brake told BBC London: \\"I don't think he should be the fall guy\\". He confirmed on Sunday Politics he would not be contesting the leadership.

He's spent the season on the Saints' practice squad. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? the eagles spoke to boston scott","completion":"Yes, the following sentence is a logical continuation of the information provided in the preceding text: The Eagles spoke to Boston Scott before signing him to their active roster. The prior text informed us about the Philadelphia Eagles signing Boston Scott, a running back from the New Orleans Saints. As part of the process of signing a player from another team's practice squad, communication between the interested team and the player is essential. They would discuss the contract, the player's role in the team, and other relevant aspects. In this case, Boston Scott, who was initially drafted by the Saints in the sixth round of the 2018 draft, had spent the season on their practice squad. His performance likely caught the attention of the Philadelphia Eagles, leading them to sign him to their active roster.

(CNN) -- Jodi Arias and her legal team began fighting for her life Tuesday when a new jury heard opening arguments on whether she should receive a life or death sentence for her murder conviction. It's been a long legal journey for Arias, 34, whom a jury found guilty last year of first-degree murder in the gruesome killing of ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, 30. This week's court proceeding in Arizona is a retrial of the penalty phase. In 2013, the same jury that convicted her became deadlocked later on whether she should be executed for the 2008 murder of Alexander, who was stabbed 29 times, shot in the face and had his neck slit from ear to ear. The impasse came when the jury voted 8-4 in favor of the death penalty for Arias, a source with knowledge of the jury's vote said at the time. \\"The tale of this relationship is one of infinite sadness,\\" Arias's lawyer, Kirk Nurmi, told the jury onTuesday. \\"The story of this relationship is one of tragedy, friendship, spirituality, lust, passion, forbidden sex, abuse and violence.\\" Nurmi said Arias went through an abusive childhood and developed a personality disorder early in life but had never committed a crime before the killing. She also suffered emotional abuse at the hands of Alexander, he said. She is very remorseful and is punishing herself, he said. The only appropriate sentence is life in prison, Nurmi concluded.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.\\"? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Question: Analyze the sequence of events that led to Antigonus II Gonatas eventually being hailed as the king of Macedon and discuss the main factors that contributed to his rise to power. Answer: Antigonus II Gonatas' rise to power can largely be attributed to the tumultuous political climate in the aftermath of Cassander's death, as well as the strategic decisions made by his father, Demetrius. Following Cassander's death in 298 BCE, an opportunity arose for Demetrius to invade Macedon, eventually seizing the Macedonian throne in 294 BCE. He then went on to conquer Thessaly and most of central Greece, further solidifying his reign. However, in 288 BCE, Demetrius faced defeat at the hands of Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus, who invaded Macedon and claimed the kingdom for themselves. Despite this setback, Demetrius continued to build support in central Greece and the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens but ultimately struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which granted him passage to Asia Minor to wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia. He left his son, Antigonus Gonatas, in Greece to maintain control over his territories. After encountering some initial successes, Demetrius was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 BCE, ultimately dying in captivity. In the meantime, Lysimachus, who had claimed Macedon and Thessaly for himself, faced defeat and was killed by Seleucus in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium. Seleucus then sought to conquer Lysimachus' territories in Thrace and Macedon but was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus, who subsequently crowned himself as king of Macedon. Ptolemy's reign was short-lived, however, as he was killed during a Gaul invasion in 279 BCE. As a result, Macedon was plunged into a state of anarchy. In this chaotic environment, Antigonus II Gonatas, now an experienced and capable leader, invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 BCE and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. His military victory and leadership skills led him to be hailed as the king of Macedon, which he would rule for the next 35 years. In summary, Antigonus II Gonatas' rise to power can be attributed to the combination of his father's strategic decisions, the shifting power dynamics in the region, and his own military prowess in seizing opportunities amidst the chaos surrounding Macedon."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What's the answer to that question: what major airport is near destin florida?

Answer the following question: Given the following context: André Kertész (French: [kɛʁtɛs]; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known. They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period. answer the following question: What is the original name of the person who was involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement?

Harrington promises to cancel an investigation of Karswell's involvement in Satanism if Karswell will rescind a threat he has made against Harrington. After learning that a parchment given to Harrington has disintegrated, Karswell glances at the clock and ushers Harrington out, promising to do all that he can. As Harrington drives home, a gigantic demon materialises and pursues him. Losing control of the car, Harrington crashes into an electrical pole and is electrocuted. Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) arrives in England to attend a convention at which Harrington had intended to expose Karswell's cult. Holden is informed of Harrington's death and that the only link between it and Karswell's cult is an accused murderer, Rand Hobart (Brian Wilde), who has fallen into a catatonic stupor. While Harrington's collaborators consider the possibility of supernatural forces, Holden rejects the idea as superstition. Following Harrington's notes, Holden visits the British Museum's library to examine books on witchcraft. A book Holden requests is discovered to be missing. Karswell offers to show Holden his own copy at his mansion. At Harrington's funeral, Holden meets the dead man's niece, Joanna (Peggy Cummins), who gives him Harrington's diary.

Write an article with the title: \\"Memorial Day ceremonies honor those who serve\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Memorial Day ceremonies honor those who serve As the sun cuts through the morning mist and the birds sing their praise to the dawn, men and women gather together from all walks of life to participate in one of the most solemn and honorable traditions in America - Memorial Day ceremonies. Held each year on the last Monday of May, Memorial Day originates from the post-Civil War era and honours those who have paid the ultimate price for our nation's freedom and security. These ceremonies are a powerful reminder of the sacrifices made by our military service members, past and present. From large-scale parades in major cities to small-town gatherings at local cemeteries, Memorial Day ceremonies take many forms, all with the common goal of honouring the men and women who have worn the uniform and given their lives in the service of the United States of America. The ceremonies foster a sense of unity, providing an opportunity for all who attend to remember, mourn, and express their gratitude for the lives that have been lost to protect the nation's ideals. One of the most iconic symbols of Memorial Day is the placement of American flags on the graves of fallen soldiers. Families, friends, and volunteers venture out to cemeteries across the country to adorn each headstone with a symbol of national pride, ensuring that their memory and sacrifice are acknowledged. In Arlington National Cemetery, for example, an annual event called \\"Flags In\\" involves members of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, also known as The Old Guard, placing flags on more than 228,000 headstones. Another time-honored ritual is the laying of wreaths on memorials or cenotaphs by military personnel, government officials, and members of the public. These wreaths are a visual representation of the gratitude and remembrance bestowed upon the fallen. Their circular shape signifies eternity and the continuity of life, reminding us that the sacrifices of those who have passed still resonate with us today. Memorial Day ceremonies often incorporate moments of silence or reflection. Community members are invited to partake in prayer, meditation, or contemplation to create a sacred space for honouring and remembering the fallen. This poignant reflection provides a moment of introspection, fostering an appreciation for the bravery and selflessness of those who have lost their lives in service to their country. On a grander scale, the National Memorial Day Parade takes place in Washington, D.C., featuring a procession of patriotic floats, high school marching bands, and uniformed veterans. It offers a powerful display of pride in remembering those who have fought and died for the United States. Adding to the spirit of remembrance, veterans' organizations like the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars hold events, marches, and vigils to honor their fallen comrades. As families celebrate the beginning of the summer season with picnics, barbecues, and outdoor activities, it is important to pause and remember the true meaning of the day. Memorial Day ceremonies serve as a vital link between the past and the present, ensuring that the sacrifices made by courageous men and women are never forgotten. In attending such events and participating in these acts of remembrance, we also indirectly support those currently serving by acknowledging the weight and importance of their duty. Ultimately, Memorial Day ceremonies are a vital manifestation of our collective appreciation for those who have given everything for our freedom. It is through these gatherings, moments of silence, and commemorative acts that we can reaffirm our commitment to those who serve, continue their legacies, and extend our deepest gratitude for their ultimate act of devotion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The wolf head crest also appears in the late 16th-century stained glass of the Withdrawing Room. The chimneypiece in this room is decorated with female caryatids and bears the arms of Elizabeth I; its plaster would originally have been painted and gilded, and traces of this still remain.William Moreton III used what is today known as the Exhibition Room as a bedroom in the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the adjoining Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition Room as a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style tempera painting, thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house, with a much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.The Corn Store adjacent to the Chapel may originally have been used as accommodation for a gatekeeper or steward.

Complete the next sentence: How to immobilize an injured or frightened cat Wrap the cat in a pillowcase then put it in a box. One of the safest and easiest ways to immobilize a cat is by wrapping its body in a pillowcase. Place your cat on top of a pillowcase lying on a flat surface, several inches from the edge of the pillowcase.","completion":"Begin by calmly and gently talking to the cat to provide reassurance and help reduce its stress levels. Approach the cat slowly, ensuring not to make any sudden movements that may startle it further. Remember to wear gloves for added protection, as injured or frightened cats may instinctively become aggressive. Start by gently grasping the cat from behind, holding it by scruff of the neck and supporting its lower body with your other hand. This helps to control the animal and reduces the risk of injury for both you and the cat. Slowly and securely, lower the cat onto the pillowcase, ensuring that its head is facing the open side of the pillowcase. Once the cat is in position, hold the two upper corners of the pillowcase and slowly fold them over the cat's back. Be cautious and careful while doing this to avoid unnecessary movement and pain for the injured cat. Make sure to tuck the pillowcase underneath the cat, enclosing it without creating too tight of a wrap. Next, hold the bottom corners of the pillowcase and fold them up towards the cat's head, creating a secure and snug hold around the animal. By doing so, you will help to prevent the cat from wriggling free and ensure its safety during transportation to a veterinary clinic or emergency facility. Now that the cat is safely wrapped and immobilized in the pillowcase, gently and carefully lift it up with both hands, ensuring to maintain adequate support for the cat's body. Transfer the cat into an appropriately sized box or pet carrier for easy and secure transportation, placing it so that its head remains towards the opening of the box, allowing the cat to breathe comfortably. Before closing the box, provide a soft layer of cushioning, such as towels or blankets, to help stabilize the cat's body and minimize discomfort during the transport. Ensure that the box or carrier has adequate air holes and keep the cat in an upright position. It is important to handle the cat as gently as possible to prevent further stress or aggravation of injuries. The process of immobilization should be done with great care and precaution, as an injured or frightened cat may react unpredictably. Once the cat is safely secured in the box or carrier, swiftly transport it to a veterinarian or emergency facility for appropriate care and treatment. Time is of the essence when dealing with injured animals, and ensuring that your cat receives prompt medical attention is crucial to its recovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which language is this?","completion":"The language used in the given sentence \\"Pomatuješ na naši dohodu?\\" is Czech. Czech is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic and by Czech speakers worldwide. Czech is very closely related to Slovak, and it also shares similarities with other Slavic languages such as Polish, Russian, and Serbian. The sentence translates to \\"Do you remember our agreement?\\" in English. In Czech, the word \\"pomatuješ\\" means \\"do you remember\\", \\"na\\" is a preposition that can translate to \\"on\\" or \\"at\\", \\"naši\\" means \\"our\\", and \\"dohodu\\" means \\"agreement\\" or \\"deal\\". As demonstrated in the sentence, Czech language uses subject-verb-object sentence structure like in most of the other Slavic languages and English. Czech is an inflected language, meaning that words change their form according to grammatical rules such as gender, number, and case. This enables a certain degree of flexibility in word order, which can be helpful in expressing emphasis and other contextual information. Additionally, Czech uses diacritic marks (accent signs) to indicate differences in pronunciation. In terms of its alphabet, the Czech language uses the Latin script, with 40 letters based on the addition of diacritics to 26 Latin characters. Some unique characters include Č (č), Š (š), and Ž (ž), which represent specific sounds in the language. Furthermore, Czech vocabulary has evolved with influences from Latin, German, and other regional languages. Overall, the Czech language is a rich and complex language with a long history and a multitude of regional dialects. It has contributed to the cultural development and identity of the Czech Republic and its people, as well as being an essential communication tool in the broader Slavic language family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: An endangered deer with vampire-like fangs was spotted for the first time in nearly 60 years, in a remote forest in northeastern Afghanistan. The fanged creature is known as the Kashmir musk deer, and it is native to the Himalayas of northern India, Pakistan's Kashmir region and northern Afghanistan. Only the male deer have fangs, and they use them during mating season to compete for females. A team of researchers scoured Afghanistan's Nuristan province during 2008 and 2009, and recorded five sightings of the animal. This was the first time the species had been spotted since 1948. During the survey, the researchers spotted a single male Kashmir musk deer near the same area three separate times. The researchers also recorded one female and her baby, and saw a second single female that they think may have been the same deer, without her baby. These musk deer are classified as an endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. Musk-deer meat is a local delicacy, but the species is mostly hunted for its scent glands that are more valuable by weight than gold -- some believe the glands have pharmaceutical properties, and they sell for nearly 20,455 per pound (45,000 per kilogram) on the black market, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Three decades of war have ravaged Nuristan province, and the continued violence and political instability make the black-market trade of scent glands uncontrollable. Furthermore, the species is quickly losing suitable habitat. All of the musk deer were spotted on sheltered rocky outcrops around 9,843 feet (3,000 meters) high. In the summer, they regularly trek along steep slopes that make them almost impossible to approach and keep them ly safe from hunters. However, heavy snowfall in the winter drives the species farther down, to more human-accessible slopes, and hunters come from all over the country to stalk the deer for their valuable scent glands.

Benjamin had not broken a bone as a kid and was fearless.. (2). Nelson had not broken a bone as a kid and was fearless..","completion":"Benjamin wanted to learn to skateboard but Nelson thought it was dangerous. The sentence could end in either of the following ways, depending on which character perspective you want to emphasize in the story: 1) Benjamin had not broken a bone as a kid and was fearless: In this case, the sentence focuses on Benjamin's perspective. Growing up, Benjamin had never experienced injury or pain from risky activities such as skateboarding. This instilled a sense of fearlessness in him and drove him to pursue skateboarding as a new hobby. He believed that his good fortune and youthful exuberance would continue to protect him from harm. This indifference to risk created tension between Benjamin and Nelson, who perceived skateboarding as a dangerous activity and worried about the potential consequences. In this scenario, the story may revolve around Benjamin's journey to learn skateboarding and overcome the challenges he faces due to his inexperience and Nelson's apprehensive attitude. Ultimately, both characters may learn valuable lessons from their differences. Benjamin may come to understand the importance of safety precautions and respecting the fears of others, while Nelson may become more open-minded about new activities and realize the value of pushing oneself beyond one's comfort zone. 2) Nelson had not broken a bone as a kid and was fearless: In this alternative ending, the focus shifts to Nelson's perspective. Nelson, having never experienced injuries or pain during his childhood, developed a sense of fearlessness and security. Despite this personal outlook, he viewed skateboarding as a dangerous activity and expressed his concerns for Benjamin's safety. Nelson's apprehension might stem from hearing about accidents or witnessing the negative experiences of others. As a result, he wanted to shield Benjamin from potential harm, even if he hadn't experienced it himself. In this version of the story, Nelson's protectiveness could act as a catalyst for both characters to explore their beliefs and attitudes towards risk-taking and develop a more balanced perspective. As Benjamin navigates the world of skateboarding and encounters challenges along the way, Nelson might start to acknowledge the benefits of facing one's fears and trying new things. Meanwhile, Benjamin might learn that considering the potential dangers of an activity and being cautious can still lead to personal growth and fulfilment. Both endings offer unique insights into human nature, highlighting the complex interactions of fearlessness, risk-taking, and personal growth.

Even if we stopped killings everywhere, we couldn't do so without killing people ourselves. Does it follow that \\"We couldn't stop killings everywhere without killing people ourselves. \\"?","completion":"To analyze this statement, let's break it down step by step: 1. Understand the statement: The statement claims that even if we were able to stop all killings everywhere, we could not do so without killing some people in the process. In other words, to put an end to killings, we would have to engage in killing as well. 2. Define 'killings': In this context, \\"killings\\" refers to intentionally causing the death of another person or persons. 3. Explore scenarios: Let's consider different scenarios in which we try to stop killings everywhere. This could involve implementing stricter laws, educating people about conflict resolution, providing adequate support systems for mental health, and finding non-violent solutions to problems. In these scenarios, it does not necessarily require us to kill any people. 4. Analyze the statement's absolute nature: The statement implies that there is no way to stop killings without engaging in killings ourselves. This is quite an absolutist claim, which may not hold true for every real-world situation. 5. Evaluate: Upon reflecting on the scenarios where killings can be stopped without killing others and considering the absolutist nature of the statement, it does not logically follow that \\"We couldn't stop killings everywhere without killing people ourselves.\\" So, the answer is no, it does not necessarily follow that \\"We couldn't stop killings everywhere without killing people ourselves.\\" There could be alternative, non-violent means of addressing and stopping killings which do not involve causing more deaths."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation. - Alexandria (or ; Arabic: '; '; \\"\\") is the second largest city and a major economic centre in Egypt, extending about along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the north central part of the country. Its low elevation on the Nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports. It is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination. - The Balearic Islands are an archipelago of Spain in the western Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. - Roussillon (or ; ) is one of the historical counties of the former Principality of Catalonia, corresponding roughly to the present-day southern French \\"département\\" of Pyrénées-Orientales (Eastern Pyrenees). It may also refer to \\"Northern Catalonia\\" or \\"French Catalonia\\", the first used by Catalan-speakers and the second used by French-speakers. A 1998 survey found that 34% of respondents stated they speak Catalan, and a further 21% understand it. - Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula. Under the Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed Callaecia (or Gallaecia, whence modern Galicia). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the \\"vicarius\\" for the Hispaniae (that is, the Celtic provinces). The name, Hispania, was also used in the period of Visigothic rule. - The Visigoths were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths. These tribes flourished and spread during the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or the Migration Period. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD. - Languedoc-Roussillon is a former administrative region of France. Since 1 January 2016, it is part of the new region Occitanie. It comprises five departments, and borders the other French regions of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Rhône-Alpes, Auvergne, Midi-Pyrénées on the one side, and Spain, Andorra and the Mediterranean Sea on the other side. It is the southernmost region of mainland France. - Hispania Ulterior (English: \\"Further Spain\\", or occasionally \\"Thither Spain\\") was a region of Hispania during the Roman Republic, roughly located in Baetica and in the Guadalquivir valley of modern Spain and extending to all of Lusitania (modern Portugal, Extremadura and a small part of Salamanca province) and Gallaecia (modern Northern Portugal and Galicia). Its capital was Corduba. - The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian. - Languedoc ( Occitan: \\"Lengadòc\\" ) is a former province of France. Its territory is now contained in the modern-day region of Occitanie in the south of France. Its capital city was Toulouse. It had an area of approximately 27,376 square kilometers (10,570 square miles). - The Principate is the name sometimes given to the first period of the Roman Empire from the beginning of the reign of Augustus in about 30 BC to the Crisis of the Third Century in 284 AD, after which it evolved into the so-called \\"Dominate\\". - Gallia Narbonensis (Latin for \\"Gaul of Narbonne\\", from its chief settlement) was a Roman province located in what is now Languedoc and Provence, in southern France. It was also known as Provincia Nostra (\\"our Province\\"), from its having been the first Roman province north of the Alps, and as Gallia Transalpina (\\"Transalpine Gaul\\"), distinguishing it from Cisalpine Gaul in northern Italy. It became a Roman province in the late 2nd century BC. Its boundaries were roughly defined by the Mediterranean Sea to the south and the Cévennes and Alps to the north and west. The western region of Gallia Narbonensis was known as Septimania. - Arius (250 or 256336) was a Christian presbyter and ascetic of Berber origin, and priest in Baucalis in Alexandria, Egypt. His teachings about the nature of the Godhead in Christianity, which emphasized the Father's divinity over the Son, and his opposition to what would become the dominant Christology, Homoousian Christology, made him a primary topic of the First Council of Nicaea, which was convened by Emperor Constantine the Great in 325. - Tarraco is the ancient name of the current city of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain). It was the oldest Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula, founded during the Second Punic War by Scipio Calvus, and became capital of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior, and of Hispania Tarraconensis during the Roman Empire. - Septimania ( ) was the western region of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis that passed under the control of the Visigoths in 462, when Septimania was ceded to their king, Theodoric II. Under the Visigoths it was known as simply Gallia or Narbonensis. It corresponded roughly with the modern French region of Languedoc-Roussillon. It passed briefly to the Emirate of Córdoba in the eighth century before its conquest by the Franks, who by the end of the ninth century termed it Gothia or the Gothic March (\\"Marca Gothica\\"). - God the Father is a title given to God in various religions, most prominently in Christianity. In mainstream trinitarian Christianity, God the Father is regarded as the first person of the Trinity, followed by the second person God the Son (Jesus Christ) and the third person God the Holy Spirit. Since the second century, Christian creeds included affirmation of belief in \\"God the Father (Almighty)\\", primarily as his capacity as \\"Father and creator of the universe\\". Yet, in Christianity the concept of God as the father of Jesus Christ goes metaphysically further than the concept of God as the Creator and father of all people, as indicated in the Apostle's Creed where the expression of belief in the \\"Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth\\" is immediately, but separately followed by in \\"Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord\\", thus expressing both senses of fatherhood. - Arianism, in Christianity, is a Christological concept that asserts that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who was created by God the Father at a point in time, is distinct from the Father and is, therefore subordinate to God and not the same as. Arian teachings were first attributed to Arius (c. AD 250336), a Christian presbyter in Alexandria, Egypt. The teachings of Arius and his supporters were opposed to the prevailing theological views held by proto-orthodox Christians, regarding the nature of the Trinity and the nature of Christ. The Arian concept of Christ is that the Son of God did not always exist but was created by God the Father. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - The term tetrarchy (from the , \\"tetrarchia\\", \\"leadership of four [people]\\") describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals, but in modern usage usually refers to the system instituted by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293, marking the end of the Crisis of the Third Century and the recovery of the Roman Empire. This tetrarchy lasted until c. 313, when internecine conflict eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving Constantine in control of the western half of the empire, and Licinius in control of the eastern half. - Hispania Citerior (English: \\"Hither Spain\\", or \\"Nearer Spain\\") was a Roman Province in Hispania during the Roman Republic. It was on the eastern coast of Spain down to the town of Cartago Nova, today's Cartagena in the autonomous community of Murcia, Spain. It roughly covered today's Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia and Valencia. Further south there was the Roman Province of Hispania Ulterior (\\"Further Spain\\"), which further away from Rome. The two provinces were formed in 197 BC, four years after the end of the Second Punic War (218-201 BC). During this war Scipio Africanus defeated the Carthaginians at the Battle of Ilipa (near Seville) in 206 BC. This led to the Romans taking over the Carthaginian possessions in southern Spain and on the east coast up to the River Ebro. Several governors of Hispania Citerior commanded wars against the Celtiberians who lived to the west of this province. In the late first century BC Augustus reorganised the Roman provinces in Hispania and Hispania Citerior was replaced by the larger province of Hispania Tarraconensis, which included the territories the Romans had conquered in central, northern and north-western Hispania. Augustus also renamed Hispania Ulterior Hispania Baetica and created a third province, Hispania Lusitania. - Gallaecia or Callaecia, also known as Hispania Gallaecia, was the name of a Roman province in the north-west of Hispania, approximately present-day Galicia, northern Portugal, Asturias and Leon and the later Suebic Kingdom of Gallaecia. The Roman cities included the port Cale (Porto), the governing centers Bracara Augusta (Braga), Lucus Augusti (Lugo) and Asturica Augusta (Astorga) and their administrative areas Conventus bracarensis, Conventus lucensis and Conventus asturicensis. - Reccared ( or Recared ; Latin : Reccaredus ; Spanish : Recaredo ) I ( c. 559 -- 31 May 601 ) ( reigned 586 -- 601 ) was Visigothic King of Hispania , Septimania and Galicia . His reign marked a climactic shift in history , with the king 's renunciation of Arianism in favour of Chalcedonian Christianity in 587 . Reccared was the younger son of King Leovigild by his first wife Theodosia . Like his father , Reccared had his capital at Toledo . The Visigothic kings and nobles were traditionally Arian Christians , while the Hispano - Roman population were Roman Catholics . The Catholic bishop Leander of Seville was instrumental in converting the elder son and heir of Leovigild , Hermenegild , to Catholicism . Leander supported his rebellion and was exiled for his role . When King Leovigild died , within a few weeks of April 21 , 586 , bishop Leander was swift to return to Toledo . The new king had been associated with his father in ruling the kingdom and was acclaimed king by the Visigothic nobles without opposition . In January 587 , Reccared renounced Arianism for Catholicism , the single great event of his reign and the turning point for Visigothic Hispania . Most Arian nobles and ecclesiastics followed his example , certainly those around him at Toledo , but there were Arian uprisings , notably in Septimania , his northernmost province , beyond the Pyrenees , where the leader of opposition was the Arian bishop Athaloc , who had the reputation among his Catholic enemies of being virtually a second Arius . Among the secular leaders of the Septimanian insurrection , the counts Granista and Wildigern appealed to Guntram of Burgundy , who saw his opportunity and sent his dux Desiderius . Reccared 's army defeated the Arian insurgents and their Catholic allies with great slaughter , Desiderius himself being slain . The next conspiracy broke out in the west , Lusitania , headed by Sunna , the Arian bishop of Mérida , and count Seggo . Claudius , Reccared 's dux Lusitaniae , put down the rising , Sunna being banished... - Theodoric II (Gothic: Þiudareiks II), \\"Teodorico\\" in Spanish and Portuguese, (426 early 466) was the eighth King of Visigoths from 453 to 466. - Lusitania or Hispania Lusitana was an ancient Iberian Roman province including approximately all of modern Portugal south of the Douro river and part of modern Spain (the present autonomous community of Extremadura and a small part of the province of Salamanca). It was named after the Lusitani or Lusitanian people (an Indo-European people). Its capital was \\"Emerita Augusta\\" (currently Mérida, Spain), and it was initially part of the Roman Republic province of Hispania Ulterior, before becoming a province of its own in the Roman Empire. Romans first came to the territory around the mid 2nd century BC. A war with Lusitanian tribes followed, from 155 to 139 BC. In 27 BC, the province was created.

Stanley Donen ( DAWN-@n; born April 13, 1924) is an American film director and choreographer whose most celebrated works are Singin' in the Rain and On the Town, both of which he co-directed with actor and dancer Gene Kelly. Other noteworthy films include Royal Wedding, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Funny Face, Indiscreet, Damn Yankees!, Charade, and Two for the Road. He began his career in the chorus line on Broadway for director George Abbott, where he befriended Kelly. Stanley Donen was born in Columbia, South Carolina to Mordecai Moses Donen, a dress-shop manager, and Helen (Cohen), the daughter of a jewelry salesman. His younger sister Carla Donen Davis was born in August 1937. Although born to Jewish parents, he became an atheist in his youth. Donen described his childhood as lonely and unhappy as one of the few Jews in Columbia, and he was occasionally bullied by anti-semitic classmates at school. To help cope with his isolation, he spent much of his youth in local movie theaters and was especially fond of Westerns, comedies and thrillers. The film that had the strongest impact on him was the 1933 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musical Flying Down to Rio. Donen said that he \\"must have seen the picture thirty or forty times. I was transported into some sort of fantasy world where everything seemed to be happy, comfortable, easy and supported. A sense of well-being filled me.\\" He shot and screened home movies with an 8 mm camera and projector that his father bought for him. Inspired by Astaire, Donen took dance lessons in Columbia and performed at the local Town Theater. His family often traveled to New York City during summer vacations where he saw Broadway musicals and took further dance lessons. One of his early instructors in New York was Ned Wayburn, who had taught eleven-year-old Astaire in 1910. After graduating from high school at sixteen, Donen attended the University of South Carolina for one summer semester, studying psychology. Encouraged by his mother, he moved to New York City to pursue dancing on stage in the fall of 1940. After two auditions he was cast as a chorus dancer in the original Broadway production of Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, directed by the legendary George Abbott. The titular Pal Joey was played by the young up-and-comer Gene Kelly, who became a Broadway star in the role. Abbott cast Donen in the chorus of his next Broadway show Best Foot Forward. He became the show's assistant stage manager, and Kelly asked him to be his assistant choreographer. Eventually Donen was fired from Best Foot Forward, but in 1942 was the stage manager and assistant choreographer for Abbott's next show Beat the Band. In 1946, Donen briefly returned to Broadway to help choreograph dance numbers for Call Me Mister.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When did he decide to become a cheoreographer?","completion":"Stanley Donen decided to become a choreographer after he was cast as a chorus dancer in the original Broadway production of Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, directed by the legendary George Abbott.

Clothes protect people from the elements, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. However, clothing that is too sheer, thin, small, tight, etc., offers less protection. Clothes also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific environmental hazards, such as insects, noxious chemicals, weather, weapons, and contact with abrasive substances. Conversely, clothing may protect the environment from the clothing wearer, as with doctors wearing medical scrubs. Q: What type of hazard is noxious chemicals?","completion":"Noxious chemicals are a type of environmental hazard. They are substances that can be harmful or lethal to humans and other living organisms, especially if they are inhaled, ingested or come into contact with skin. These could include anything from pesticides and industrial chemicals to certain types of cleaning products. Clothing designed to protect against such hazards is commonly used in industries where workers are likely to be exposed to dangerous substances, like in chemical plants, laboratories, or certain healthcare settings. This special clothing is often referred to as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and may include items like chemically resistant suits, gloves, boots, goggles, respirators, and more. These garments are designed to create a barrier between the wearer and the harmful substances they could potentially come into contact with. This barrier minimizes exposure and therefore reduces the risk of harm or injury to the person wearing them. Scientists and researchers in labs, for example, might use lab coats, gloves, and safety goggles to protect their skin and eyes from spills or splashes of corrosive or toxic substances. Workers in the cleanup or transportation of hazardous waste also utilize similar protection methods, often with more extensive coverage. Meanwhile, healthcare workers may use PPE like aprons, gloves, and face shields to protect themselves from exposure to infectious biological hazards, including body fluids that may contain viruses or bacteria. While not often thought of as “noxious chemicals,” these biological hazards can also be extremely harmful if they come into contact with unprotected skin or mucous membranes, illustrating even further the crucial role clothing can play in protection. Altogether, clothing serves a significant protective role, whether it's against the elements, physical hazards, or chemical and biological ones. It is essential to choose and use the correct type of protective clothing based on the risks present in a given environment or activity, in order to ensure the best possible protection against potential hazards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

CHAPTER XX Valentin de Bellegarde died, tranquilly, just as the cold, faint March dawn began to illumine the faces of the little knot of friends gathered about his bedside. An hour afterwards Newman left the inn and drove to Geneva; he was naturally unwilling to be present at the arrival of Madame de Bellegarde and her first-born. At Geneva, for the moment, he remained. He was like a man who has had a fall and wants to sit still and count his bruises. He instantly wrote to Madame de Cintre, relating to her the circumstances of her brother's death--with certain exceptions--and asking her what was the earliest moment at which he might hope that she would consent to see him. M. Ledoux had told him that he had reason to know that Valentin's will--Bellegarde had a great deal of elegant personal property to dispose of--contained a request that he should be buried near his father in the church-yard of Fleurieres, and Newman intended that the state of his own relations with the family should not deprive him of the satisfaction of helping to pay the last earthly honors to the best fellow in the world. He reflected that Valentin's friendship was older than Urbain's enmity, and that at a funeral it was easy to escape notice. Madame de Cintre's answer to his letter enabled him to time his arrival at Fleurieres. This answer was very brief; it ran as follows:-- \\"I thank you for your letter, and for your being with Valentin. It is a most inexpressible sorrow to me that I was not. To see you will be nothing but a distress to me; there is no need, therefore, to wait for what you call brighter days. It is all one now, and I shall have no brighter days.

Background: Gaius Julius Caesar (; 12 or 13 July 100 BC - 15 March 44 BC), known by his cognomen Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Context: Caesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortion or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces bordered on unconquered territory, and parts of Gaul were known to be unstable. Some of Rome's Gallic allies had been defeated by their rivals at the Battle of Magetobriga, with the help of a contingent of Germanic tribes. The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated these tribes. In response to Caesar's earlier activities, the tribes in the north-east began to arm themselves. Caesar treated this as an aggressive move and, after an inconclusive engagement against the united tribes, he conquered the tribes piecemeal. Meanwhile, one of his legions began the conquest of the tribes in the far north, directly opposite Britain. During the spring of 56 BC, the Triumvirs held a conference, as Rome was in turmoil and Caesar's political alliance was coming undone. The Lucca Conference renewed the First Triumvirate and extended Caesar's governorship for another five years. The conquest of the north was soon completed, while a few pockets of resistance remained. Caesar now had a secure base from which to launch an invasion of Britain. In 55 BC, Caesar repelled an incursion into Gaul by two Germanic tribes, and followed it up by building a bridge across the Rhine and making a show of force in Germanic territory, before returning and dismantling the bridge. Late that summer, having subdued two other tribes, he crossed into Britain, claiming that the Britons had aided one of his enemies the previous year, possibly the Veneti of Brittany. His intelligence information was poor, and although he gained a beachhead on the coast, he could not advance further, and returned to Gaul for the winter. He returned the following year, better prepared and with a larger force, and achieved more. He advanced inland, and established a few alliances. However, poor harvests led to widespread revolt in Gaul, which forced Caesar to leave Britain for the last time. While Caesar was in Britain his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife, had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to re-secure Pompey's support by offering him his great-niece in marriage, but Pompey declined. In 53 BC Crassus was killed leading a failed invasion of the east. Rome was on the brink of civil war. Pompey was appointed sole consul as an emergency measure, and married the daughter of a political opponent of Caesar. The Triumvirate was dead. Though the Gallic tribes were just as strong as the Romans militarily, the internal division among the Gauls guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar. Vercingetorix's attempt in 52 BC to unite them against Roman invasion came too late. He proved an astute commander, defeating Caesar in several engagements, but Caesar's elaborate siege-works at the Battle of Alesia finally forced his surrender. Despite scattered outbreaks of warfare the following year, Gaul was effectively conquered. Plutarch claimed that during the Gallic Wars the army had fought against three million men (of whom one million died, and another million were enslaved), subjugated 300 tribes, and destroyed 800 cities. Question: did he win? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Julius Caesar was largely victorious in his military campaigns, particularly during the Gallic Wars. Despite facing challenges and strong opposition from various Gallic tribes, Caesar's strategic and military prowess enabled him to subdue and conquer much of Gaul. His efforts to unite the Gallic tribes under Vercingetorix were ultimately unsuccessful, leading to their defeat at the Battle of Alesia. Caesar's Roman forces faced three million men, resulting in the death of one million and the enslavement of another million, according to Plutarch. Caesar's campaigns led to the subjugation of 300 tribes and the destruction of 800 cities. While Caesar did face setbacks, such as his initial invasion of Britain, he ultimately emerged victorious in many of his military engagements, solidifying Rome's hold on new territories and expanding the reach of the Roman Empire. However, these military victories did not translate into lasting political stability for Caesar, as the First Triumvirate eventually dissolved, and tensions between Caesar and Pompey escalated, pushing Rome towards civil war. Nevertheless, when examining Julius Caesar's military campaigns and conquests, especially during the Gallic Wars, it can be concluded that he was indeed victorious in many of his endeavors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Leslie Feist was born on 13 February 1976 in Amherst, Nova Scotia, Canada. Her parents are both artists. Her father, Harold Feist, is an American-Canadian abstract expressionist painter who taught at both the Alberta College of Art and Design and Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. Her mother, Lyn Feist, was a student of ceramics from Saskatchewan. Context: In 1991, at age 15, Feist got her start in music when she founded and was the lead vocalist for a Calgary punk band called Placebo (not to be confused with the English band Placebo). She and her bandmates won a local Battle of the Bands competition and were awarded the opening slot at the festival Infest 1993, featuring the Ramones. At this concert she met Brendan Canning, whose band hHead performed immediately before hers, and with whom she joined in Broken Social Scene ten years later. In 1995, Feist was forced to take time off from music to recover from vocal cord damage. She moved from Calgary to Toronto in 1996. That year she was asked by Noah Mintz of hHead to play bass in his solo project Noah's Arkweld. She played the bass guitar in Noah's Arkweld for a year despite never having played bass before. In 1998, she became the rhythm guitarist for the band By Divine Right and toured with them throughout 1998, 1999, and 2000. She also played guitar for some live performances by Bodega, but was never an official member of the band. In 1999, Feist moved into a Queen West apartment above Come As You Are with a friend of a friend, Merrill Nisker, who then began to perform as electro-punk musician Peaches. Feist worked the back of the stage at Peaches' shows, using a sock puppet and calling herself \\"Bitch Lap Lap\\". The two also toured together in England from 2000-2001, staying with Justine Frischmann of Elastica and MIA Feist appeared as a guest vocalist on The Teaches of Peaches. Feist appears in Peaches' video for the song \\"Lovertits\\", suggestively rubbing and licking a bike. Later, Feist covered this song with Gonzales (whom she met while touring with Peaches) on her album Open Season. In 2006, Feist contributed backup vocals on a track entitled \\"Give 'Er\\", which appeared on Peaches' album Impeach My Bush. Question: Which band is she in currently?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Leslie Feist is currently not in any band. She had previously been a member of various bands such as Placebo, Broken Social Scene, Noah's Arkweld, and By Divine Right. Since then, she has focused on her solo career as Feist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

With my new phone, I just place the phone into the charging dock and my phone is charge wirelessly. Was my new cell phone being charge using induction or conduction? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Your new cell phone is being charged using induction. Step 1: Identify the charging method used by the previous phone - The previous phone's charging method required a direct connection between the charger and the phone, which indicates that it was using conduction. Step 2: Analyze the charging method of the new phone - The new phone's charging method does not require a direct connection between the charger and the phone. Instead, it utilizes a charging dock, indicating that it's using a different method than conduction. Step 3: Determine which charging method is being used - There are two primary methods of wireless charging: induction and resonance. Given that the new phone uses a charging dock and does not require direct contact between the charger and the phone, this suggests that it's using induction, as resonance generally requires special equipment and is not as commonly used for consumer electronics. Conclusion: The new cell phone is being charged using induction. This is because it does not require a direct connection between the charger and the phone, and instead relies on a charging dock for wireless power transfer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. Question: \\"The Pope's visit to what country may have helped motivate the release of prisoners from that country?\\" Answer: \\"Mexico\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, the answer is incorrect.

Last month we reported about a study that showed eating even a little less salt could greatly help the heart. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The scientists used a computer model to predict how just three grams less salt a day would affect heart disease in the United States. The scientists said the results would be thirteen percent fewer heart attacks, eight percent fewer strokes , four percent fewer deaths and eleven percent fewer new cases of heart disease And two hundred forty billion dollars in health care savings. Researchers said it could prevent one hundred thousand heart attacks and ninety-two thousand deaths every year. They and public health professionals in the United States are interested in a national campaign to persuade people to eat less salt. Such campaigns are already in place in Britain, Japan and Finland. Michael Alderman is among the critics. He is a high blood pressure expert and professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Doctor Alderman says that eating less salt results in lower blood pressure. But he says studies have not clearly shown that lowering salt means fewer heart attacks or strokes. And he says salt has other biological effects. He says calling for reduction in the national diet could have good effects, but it could also have harmful results. He says there is not enough evidence _ . Another critic is David McCarron, a nutrition and kidney disease expert at the University of California, Davis. He and his team looked at large studies of diets in thirty-three countries. They found that most people around the world eat about the same amount of salt. Most of them eat more salt than American health officials advise. Doctor McCarron says the worldwide similarity suggests that a person's brain might decide how much salt to eat. Both Doctor McCarron and Doctor Alderman have connections to the Salt Institute, a trade group for the salt industry. Doctor Alderman is a member of an advisory committee.

The Republic of the Union of Myanmar is otherwise known by what name????","completion":"The Republic of the Union of Myanmar is also commonly known as Burma. To provide a deeper understanding, allow me to give you an insight into the historical background that led to such a duality in names. Myanmar, located in Southeast Asia, sits between Bangladesh, India, China, Laos, and Thailand, making it a culturally diverse country. The British annexed Burma (Myanmar) as a province of India in 1886. They named it Burma based on the dominant ethnic group, the Bamar people. The nation gained independence from the British on 4 January 1948, after a series of resistance movements, and officially became the 'Union of Burma.' However, nearly four decades later, in 1989, the ruling military junta changed the country's official name from \\"Burma\\" to \\"Myanmar\\" as part of a broader set of reforms aimed at eradicating vestiges of British colonial rule. \\"Myanmar\\" is derived from the local short-form name \\"Myanmah\\" and is thought to be representative of all the diverse ethnic groups within the country, more inclusive than the original \\"Burma\\", which is closely associated with the Bamar ethnic group. It is noteworthy to mention that the dispute over the name change is largely a political one. It was announced by a military regime that, among certain segments of the population, particularly pro-democracy groups and many countries, has not earned recognition. As a result, some entities, predominantly Western ones, still refer to the country as Burma. For instance, the United States and United Kingdom officially do not recognize \\"Myanmar\\" and continue to use \\"Burma.\\" In general parlance today, both names are used interchangeably, and both are recognized. Myanmar is more formally acknowledged in diplomacy, international relations, and legal contexts, whereas Burma is more commonly used in informal speech and writings, especially among those who still challenge the legitimacy of the government that proposed the name change. The people from this country can be referred to as Burmese in English, while in official contexts, such as the United Nations, \\"Myanmar\\" is used to refer to the country and its people. Regardless of its name, the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (or Burma) is a mesmerizing country known for its rich culture, history, and significant Buddhist sites, in particular, the stunning pagodas located all over the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - Hydnum is a genus of fungi in the Hydnaceae family. They are notable for their unusual spore-bearing structures of teeth rather than gills. The best known are the edible species \\"Hydnum repandum\\" and \\"H. rufescens\\". The word is derived from \\"(h)udnon\\"/, an Ancient Greek word for truffle. The white or buff \\"Hydnum repandum\\" has a spore scatterer of still another shape. The smooth cap grows as wide as 8 inches across. The stem is off-center and is less than 2 inches long. \\"Hydnum\\" has many brittle, white teeth from which the spores drop. The mushrooms of the \\"Hydnum\\" group grow both on ground and on wood. Some species have teeth which hang from ascending branches, while other species have teeth which project downwards from the undersurfaces of dead wood. Most \\"Hydnum\\" are safe to eat. - The Hydnaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. Originally the family encompassed all species of fungi that produced basidiocarps (fruit bodies) having a hymenium (spore-bearing surface) consisting of slender, downward-hanging tapering extensions referred to as \\"spines\\" or \\"teeth\\", whether they were related or not. This artificial but often useful grouping is now more generally called the hydnoid or tooth fungi. In the strict, modern sense, the Hydnaceae are limited to the genus \\"Hydnum\\" and related genera, with basidiocarps having a toothed or poroid hymenium. Species in the family are ectomycorrhizal, forming a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of trees and other plants. \\"Hydnum repandum\\" (the hedgehog fungus) is an edible species, commercially collected in some countries and often marketed under the French name \\"pied de mouton\\". - The Gomphaceae are a diverse family of fungi belonging in what is classically known as the Phallales or cladistically as the gomphoid-phalloid clade. The family has 13 genera and 287 species. - The Cantharellaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family contains the chanterelles and related species, a group of fungi that superficially resemble agarics (gilled mushrooms) but have smooth, wrinkled, or gill-like hymenophores (spore-bearing undersurfaces). Species in the family are ectomycorrhizal, forming a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of trees and other plants. Many of the Cantharellaceae, including the chanterelle (\\"Cantharellus cibarius\\"), the Pacific golden chanterelle (\\"Cantharellus formosus\\"), the horn of plenty (\\"Craterellus cornucopioides\\"), and the trumpet chanterelle (\\"Craterellus tubaeformis\\"), are not only edible, but are collected and marketed internationally on a commercial scale. - The Phallales are an order of fungi in the subclass Phallomycetidae. The order contains three families: the Claustulaceae, the Gomphaceae, and the Phallaceae, which, according to a 2008 estimate, collectively contain 26 genera and 88 species. - The Cantharellales are an order of fungi in the class Agaricomycetes. The order includes not only the chanterelles (Cantharellaceae), but also some of the tooth fungi (Hydnaceae), clavarioid fungi (Aphelariaceae and Clavulinaceae), and corticioid fungi (Botryobasidiaceae). Species within the order are variously ectomycorrhizal, saprotrophic, associated with orchids, or facultative plant pathogens. Those of economic importance include edible and commercially collected \\"Cantharellus\\", \\"Craterellus\\", and \\"Hydnum\\" species as well as crop pathogens in the genera \\"Ceratobasidium\\" and \\"Thanatephorus\\" (\\"Rhizoctonia\\"). - Cantharellus is a genus of popular edible mushrooms, commonly known as chanterelles. They are mycorrhizal fungi, meaning they form symbiotic associations with plants, making them very difficult to cultivate. Caution must be used when identifying chanterelles for consumption due to lookalikes, such as the Jack-O-Lantern species (\\"Omphalotus olearius\\" and others), which can make a person very ill. Despite this, chanterelles are one of the most recognized and harvested groups of edible mushrooms. - The Agaricomycetes are a class of fungi in the division Basidiomycota. The taxon is roughly identical to that defined for the Homobasidiomycetes (alternatively called holobasidiomycetes) by Hibbett & Thorn, with the inclusion of Auriculariales and Sebacinales. It includes not only mushroom-forming fungi, but also most species placed in the deprecated taxa Gasteromycetes and Homobasidiomycetes. Within the subdivision Agaricomycotina, which already excludes the smut and rust fungi, the Agaricomycetes can be further defined by the exclusion of the classes Tremellomycetes and Dacrymycetes, which are generally considered to be jelly fungi. However, a few former \\"jelly fungi\\", such as \\"Auricularia\\", are classified in the Agaricomycetes. According to a 2008 estimate, Agaricomycetes include 17 orders, 100 families, 1147 genera, and about 21000 species. Modern molecular phylogenetic analyses have been since used to help define several new orders in the Agaricomycetes: Amylocorticiales, Jaapiales, Stereopsidales, and Lepidostromatales. - The Aphelariaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family contains a small group of tropical and subtropical clavarioid fungi, but is not well characterized and has not been the subject of published research. - The Clavulinaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family is not well defined, but currently comprises species of clavarioid (club and coral) fungi as well as some corticioid (crust- and patch-forming) fungi. These species are nutritionally diverse, some being ectomycorrhizal, others wood-rotting saprotrophs, others lichenized, and yet others lichenicolous (growing on or parasitizing lichens). - Phallaceae is a family of fungi, commonly known as stinkhorn mushrooms, within the order Phallales. Stinkhorns have a worldwide distribution, but are especially prevalent in tropical regions. They are known for their foul-smelling, sticky spore masses, or gleba, borne on the end of a stalk called the receptaculum. The characteristic fruiting-body structure, a single, unbranched receptaculum with an externally attached gleba on the upper part, distinguishes the Phallaceae from other families in the Phalalles. The spore mass typically smells of carrion or dung, and attracts flies and other insects to help disperse the spores. Although there is great diversity in body structure shape among the various genera, all species in the Phallaceae begin their development as oval or round structures known as \\"eggs\\". According to a 2008 estimate, the family contains 21 genera and 77 species. - Phallomycetidae is a subclass of the class Agaricomycetes of fungi. - The Botryobasidiaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family contains a group of corticioid fungi that form thin, web-like basidiocarps. Some species form asexual anamorphs producing chlamydospores. All are believed to be wood-rotting or litter-rotting saprotrophs. None is known to be of any economic importance. - Craterellus is a genus of generally edible fungi similar to the closely related chanterelles, with some new species recently moved from the latter to the former. Both groups lack true gills on the underside of their caps, though they often have gill-like wrinkles and ridges. - The Gomphales are an order of basidiomycete fungi . Some or all families belonging to Gomphales have been sometimes included in the order Phallales ( and vice versa - they are also sometimes treated as synonyms ) , the now - obsolete Ramariaceae was also previously included in Cantharellales . Recent phylogenetic analyses include in Gomphales the families of the original description of the order by W. Jülich , with addition of Clavariadelphaceae . According to one 2008 estimate , the Gomphales contain 18 genera and 336 species . Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'.

From age six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki Public School) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother. As a result of those four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \\"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\\". In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School-- a private college preparatory school-- with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \\"Barry\\". Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer. Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \\"The opportunity that Hawaii offered - to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect - became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\\" Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \\"push questions of who I was out of my mind\\". Obama was also a member of the \\"choom gang\\", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana. After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.

Though the process of human reproduction and development consists of a series of fixed, biological stages such as mating, fertilization, growth, and maturity, external factors like culture, society, and religion can still have an influence. In this case, becoming more religious can lead to potential changes in values, beliefs, and behavior surrounding procreation and family planning. Possible indirect effects of increased religiousness on the growth of fetuses may include: 1. Attitudes towards contraception and family planning: If religious beliefs discourage the use of contraception or encourage having larger families, this could lead to an increase in the number of pregnancies, and therefore more fetuses. 2. Beliefs about the sanctity of life and abortion: A higher religiosity might lead to stronger anti-abortion stances, further contributing to an increase in the number of fetuses brought to term. 3. Changes in sexual behavior: Becoming more religious may impact sexual behavior, either by promoting abstinence until marriage or by discouraging casual sexual encounters. Consequently, the number of potential pregnancies and growing fetuses could be affected. 4. Influence on social norms and expectations: An increase in religiosity may lead to shifts in societal expectations surrounding family size, the role of women and men, and when it is appropriate to start a family. These changes can also indirectly impact the number of pregnancies and growing fetuses.

Fossett had one of his team members develop a more advanced balloon autopilot that would allow him to sleep and do other tasks while flying safely. Steve Fossett attempted the hot-air balloon trip around the world six times. This was not easy to do. He flew in the balloon'scapsule that was too small to stand upright. During his fourth attempt in 1998, he was almost killed during a storm off the coast of Australia. He fell 9,000 meters into the Coral Sea with his balloon's capsule on fire. He was later rescued at sea. Fossett successfully made the trip in 2002. The trip started and ended in Australia. He traveled more than 33,000 kilometers for more than 14 days. On this flight, Fossett set other records including a speed record of 322 kilometers per hour. One main problem with earlier balloon flights was the threat of dangerous storms. A team of weather experts e-mailed and talked to Fossett by a satellite telephone to help him avoid such weather.

Write an article based on this \\"Donald Trump's anticipated appointment of Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State firms the view that his administration's policy will be transactional, a change that will benefit Russia.\\"","completion":"Title: The Implications of Rex Tillerson's Appointment as Secretary of State on U.S.-Russia Relations Introduction Donald Trump's anticipated appointment of Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State has sparked extensive discussions on the potential consequences of such a decision for the United States' international relations, particularly with Russia. This article examines the possible implications of Tillerson's appointment for the U.S.-Russia relationship, focusing on the idea that the Trump administration's policy will be more transactional compared to those of previous administrations. Background of Rex Tillerson Rex Tillerson has spent his entire career at Exxon Mobil, beginning as a production engineer in 1975 and rising through the ranks to assume the top executive position in 2006. His professional background has made him a prominent figure in the energy industry, and his leadership has seen Exxon Mobil expand to become one of the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas companies. With operations in over 50 countries, Tillerson's experience has been largely focused on securing energy deals and development projects across the globe. Tillerson's Links to Russia Throughout his tenure at Exxon Mobil, Rex Tillerson has developed strong ties with Russia and its state-owned oil company, Rosneft. In 2011, he signed a landmark deal with Rosneft, estimated at 500 billion, to explore the vast Arctic and Russian Black Sea regions' crude oil reserves. This agreement established Tillerson as a significant figure in the Russian business community and led to him being awarded the Order of Friendship by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013. The Potential Impact on U.S.-Russia Relations With his experience as CEO of Exxon Mobil and his documented relationships with key Russian figures, it is possible that Tillerson's appointment as Secretary of State may significantly influence U.S. foreign policy towards Russia. The following factors are worth considering: 1. A Shift Toward Transactional Diplomacy: Tillerson's background in business may result in a more transactional approach to diplomacy. The Trump administration may prioritize economic and trade interests over traditional U.S. foreign policy concerns, including human rights and the global promotion of democracy. This newly-emphasized focus on practical and economic cooperation could create new opportunities for the U.S. and Russia, as both countries may seek to break existing deadlocks and pursue joint energy projects. 2. Sanctions Relief: The current U.S. sanctions against Russia — imposed in response to the annexation of Crimea and Moscow's support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine — have limited Exxon Mobil's ability to pursue its 2011 agreement with Rosneft. Tillerson, who has criticized these sanctions, could push for their rollback as Secretary of State. This move would benefit Russia and its struggling economy, which has been hampered by decreased oil prices and Western sanctions. Sanctions relief could also enable both countries to explore potential collaborations in the energy sector. 3. A Realpolitik Approach to International Relations: Tillerson's appointment as Secretary of State coincides with Trump's stated willingness to engage in realpolitik and focus on pragmatic, mutually beneficial agreements. This approach could alter the tone of U.S.-Russia relations, with both nations pursuing options for cooperation that supersede their long-standing ideological differences. In this context, Russia might emerge as a key partner for the United States, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism, arms control, and energy development. Conclusion While Rex Tillerson's anticipated appointment as Secretary of State has raised concerns about the potential reorientation of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia, it is important to recognize that any shifts are likely to be gradual and contingent upon the broader evolution of global politics. Critics argue that closer U.S.-Russia relations could embolden Putin's authoritarian regime and undermine liberal international order. However, proponents of this change argue that a more transactional approach could facilitate cooperation and stability in an increasingly multipolar world. Ultimately, the direction of U.S.-Russia relations in the Trump administration will depend on a myriad of factors, including congressional dynamics, international crises, and public opinion. Tillerson's appointment does signal the potential for a distinct rethinking of American foreign policy and its priorities, particularly with respect to transactional diplomacy and the importance of economic cooperation. As such, his tenure may indeed redefine the U.S.-Russia relationship and shape the contours of global politics in the coming years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In contrast, swimming in dolphins is primarily facilitated by their streamlined body shapes, powerful tail flukes, and well-coordinated movements of their pectoral fins, dorsal fin, and muscles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Determine the current context It's essential to determine when and where \\"here\\" refers to before we can make an accurate statement. Once we ascertain the location and time, we can proceed to verify the buffalo population's presence in that area. Step 3: Verify the accuracy of the information We need to verify that the buffalo population has indeed grown to around 400 from the original number brought in 1924. This can be done by checking historical records, consulting local authorities, or seeking expert opinions. Step 4: Consider the possibility of change The population of buffalo may have increased or decreased due to various factors such as disease, predation, or migration. Therefore, it is essential to consider the possibility that the population may not be at exactly 400. Step 5: Formulate the conclusion Once we've determined the current context, verified the accuracy of the information, and considered any possible changes to the buffalo population, we can reasonably conclude that \\"There's a herd of around 400 buffalo located [specific location].\\" So, before making the statement, it is necessary to verify if the herd is still here and if the provided data about the number of buffalo are trustworthy and up to date."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: People who are refined have opinions, but they tend to keep them to themselves when they involve other people in a negative light. If you want to be refined, then you should be above gossiping about other people, starting rumors, or asking if your two co-workers or classmates are hooking up. If you have the reputation of being a gossip, then people won’t think of you as refined at all; instead, they’ll see you as an unsophisticated, immature person. To be truly refined, you should be positive if you plan on talking about a person who isn’t in the room. Instead, practice saying nice things about people “behind their backs.” Say nice things about people who aren’t in the room and it will get back to them. Refined people don’t pick fights with people and don’t make a big deal about it if they disagree with something. They are still comfortable stating their opinions, but they don’t do so to make other people feel bad or to look superior. If you find someone challenging your ideas when you’re having a conversation, then you should be polite about disagreeing, and not resort to name calling. Refined people should be easy to get along with, and are easygoing and tend to go with the flow instead of being prickly or confrontational. If you’re asked to settle an argument and know the answer — lets say people are debating about whether a quote is attributed to The Bible or Shakespeare — then it’s best to say you’re not sure of the answer even if you do. There’s no need to cause conflict. If someone is trying to tell you your opinions are worthless, do not engage. Take the high road and exit the conversation instead of being determined to prove the person wrong. Refined people are knowledgeable and interesting, but they don’t need to brag to make it known. Even if you’ve memorized every scene in every Goddard film or speak eight foreign languages, you shouldn’t go telling everyone you know. Instead, wait for your areas of interest to come up in conversation so that people can be impressed by how much you know instead of thinking you’re obnoxious for showing off. When you share what you do know, don’t act like an authority but just casually mention the information in a friendly way instead. You should praise people on their achievements as often as you can instead of harping on your own. If you’ve really accomplished a lot, then people will hear about it. If they mention it, be modest instead of acting like yeah, you know you’re pretty great. If you really want to be refined, then it’s important for you to spend time with like-minded people. Refined people spend time with other people they can talk to about politics, wine, traveling, other cultures, foreign films, cultural events in their areas, and other subjects of interest. They don’t spend time with too many people who can’t contribute much to a conversation or who don’t listen to anything other than Top 40 and watch Judge Judy for a cultural good time. They tend to be friends with people who can stimulate them and encourage them to be even better than they are. Though it’s not refined to completely ditch someone in your circle because you think that person makes you look bad, you should think about the company you keep. If you think you spend too much time with people who are vulgar, lack class, and who bring you down, then it’s time to reconsider those relationships. People who are refined have interesting opinions about politics, sports, cuisine, wine, and other subjects, but they try to avoid being a bore and talking about them all night long. They also tend to avoid being self-absorbed and talking about themselves incessantly. They’d prefer to talk about other people or about interesting world matters instead. It’s not refined to do 90% of the talking in a conversation, no matter how interesting you may think you are. If you’ve noticed that you’re dominating a conversation, switch gears and ask the people you’re with light questions, from what they’re doing this weekend to what their favorite sports team is. Good manners are a sign of refinement. In order to have good manners, you’ll need to eat with your mouth closed, avoid cursing, wait your turn, hold doors and pull out chairs for people, and generally conduct yourself in an admirable fashion. People with good manners are sensitive to the needs of others and make sure other people, whether they are guests or serving you coffee, are feeling comfortable. Ask people how they are, respect their space, and avoid making a mess if you want to have good manners. Be polite. Always greet people in a friendly fashion, introduce yourself to people you don’t know if they join a conversation, and avoid being unnecessarily rude to people even if you think they deserve it. You don’t have to speak seventeen languages to be cultured, but it does help to know something about other cultures, whether it’s knowing how to correctly pronounce “foie gras” when you order at a French restaurant, or you know that, in certain cultures, it’s polite to remove your shoes when you enter a person’s house. There’s no one way to suddenly become cultured, but you can make an effort to get to know how people live in other parts of the world, to watch foreign films, sample the cuisines of other countries, and most importantly, avoid having the attitude that everything is done the “right way” in your country. Make a point of attending cultural events in your area, whether there are local theatres or museum openings. Read, read, read. Become knowledgeable on everything from ancient philosophy to contemporary poetry. Refined people tend to be very well-read. Refined people speak with extreme tact and understand that they have to choose their words and timing carefully when it comes to saying something. They don’t overstep their bounds and get too friendly with people they don’t know that well, they deflect negative comments from others, and they are able to be discreet when it’s necessary. They are masters at being gracious and don’t make people feel embarrassed in public. Have a sense of a person’s sense of humor before you try to make a joke. Avoid mentioning how much money you make or asking about a person’s salary. That is seen as crude and not tactful at all. If someone has something in his teeth, for example, a tactful person would try to tell him privately. Tactful people also know that timing is important. You may be excited to announce that you’re pregnant, but you should see that you should avoid doing this when your friend is gushing about her engagement. Summary:","completion":"Being refined means being polite, kind, and respectful to others. Refined people don't gossip or say mean things about others who aren't there. They don't pick fights or try to make others feel bad. If they disagree with you, they'll do it in a polite way. They're also easy to get along with and don't always need to be right. Refined people can know a lot, but they don't brag about it. They wait for the right time to share their knowledge in a nice, friendly way. Also, they give compliments to others instead of always talking about what they've done. Some of their friends are people who also talk about things like politics, traveling, or culture. They don't like to spend time with people who are rude or don't have manners. Good manners are important to refined people, like eating nicely, waiting turns, and being kind to others. Refined people also try to learn about different cultures and how things are done in other countries. They read lots and know how to speak carefully so they don't hurt other's feelings. They can make jokes, but only when they know it's okay to do so. And they don't talk about money or try to embarrass others.

Blackett failed to deal with an early delivery from the Blues and the ball fell to Andreas Christensen, but he shot wide from eight yards at a tight angle. The half descended into a scrappy affair with Young the main receiver of some tough challenges from the away side, as neither team managed to conjure up any promising chances. Deadline day loan signing Andy Kellett (centre, back row) was an unused substitute on Monday night. Manchester United had former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes between the sticks on Monday.

There's something frustrating about watching a movie like 'Murder By Numers' because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out. However, by the time the credits roll, there's no saving it. The whole thing is pretty much blown by the \\"cop side\\" of the story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on. Although Bullock is strong in her role, it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role (he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated 'Birthday Girl') as well as Chris Penn, who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. Anyway, the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all. The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well. It's too bad they weren't in a much better all-around film. Barbet Schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker.

I went into Deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while that's something like what this film is; I also can't help but think that it's just a poor man's Sleuth. The classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of the plot, but certainly it's the case with the execution. The casting of Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it. The film is based on a play by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him. After his latest play bombs, Sidney finds himself at a low; and this is not helped when a play named Deathtrap; written by an amateur he taught, arrives on his doorstep. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own; which involves inviting round the amateur scribe, killing him, and then passing Deathtrap off as his own work. Despite all of its clever twists and turns; Deathtrap falls down on one primary element, and that's the characters. The film fails to provide a single likable character, and it's very hard to care about the story when you're not rooting for any of the players. This is not helped by the acting. Michael Caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect, but nobody else does themselves proud. Christopher Reeve is awkward in his role, while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance. It's lucky then that the story is good; and it is just about good enough to save the film. The plot features plenty of twists and turns; some work better than others, but there's always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting. Director Sidney Lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus. The central location is interesting in its own right, and the cinematography fits the film well. Overall, I have to admit that I did enjoy this film; but it could have been much, much better.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"A: The first step of the process is \\"water is in the air.\\" This occurs when water vapor, an invisible gaseous form of water, is present in the Earth's atmosphere. Water vapor is generated through various processes such as evaporation, where water from the Earth's surface turns into vapor and rises into the atmosphere, and transpiration, where plants release water vapor through tiny openings in their leaves called stomata. The amount of water vapor in the air can vary depending on factors such as temperature, air pressure, and humidity levels. When the air contains a high amount of water vapor, it creates an environment conducive to the formation of clouds, which are large groups of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. As the air temperature decreases, water vapor in the atmosphere can condense into tiny ice crystals if the temperature falls below the freezing point of water, around 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). This is more likely to occur at higher altitudes where the air has cooled sufficiently, such as in the atmosphere's upper troposphere. Once the tiny ice crystals have formed, they can collide with each other due to air currents and turbulence within the cloud. As these ice crystals collide, they can stick together and aggregate through a process called accretion. This causes the ice crystals to grow in size, and over time, they can develop into more intricate and unique shapes that eventually resemble snowflakes. When enough ice crystals have combined, the snowflakes become too heavy to be supported by the air currents within the cloud. They then begin to fall from the cloud due to gravity, and depending on the temperature and conditions below the cloud, they may either fall as snow (if the air is cold enough) or they may melt into rain droplets before reaching the ground in warmer conditions. In summary, the first step of the process of snowflake formation is the presence of water vapor in the air, which is essential to initiate the condensation and freezing processes that ultimately result in the formation of snowflakes and their subsequent descent to the ground as snow."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Dolphins entered their first game of the season with a 0-0 record, traveling to face the 0-0 Houston Texans. The game was the first start for rookie quarterback Ryan Tannehill and head coach Joe Philbin. Tannehill became the first Dolphins rookie quarterback to start the first game of the season. Entering the game the Texans are the only team the Dolphins have not beaten, holding a 0-6 record all-time against the team. Both teams moved the ball well on their opening drives, but failed to score. The Dolphins received the ball on their own 42-yard line after a missed field goal by Houston kicker Shayne Graham. After a Reggie Bush recovered fumble on 3rd down on the Houston 14-yard line the Dolphins kicker Dan Carpenter attempted and successfully executed a 39-yard field goal with (3:19) left in the first quarter. Both defenses held steady, keeping both offenses out of the redzone heading to the mid-way point of the second quarter. However, at the (7:35) point, quarterback Tannehill was intercepted by Johnathan Joseph at the 50-yard line for 36 yards. Within the shadow of their own goal posts the Dolphins held the Texans to a Shayne Graham 35-yard field goal. The interception by Tannehill was the first of his career, and marked a downhill spiral for the rest of the game. Following the score the Dolphins moved quickly to the Houston side of the field after a 10-yard rush by Reggie Bush and 32-yard pass to running back Daniel Thomas. But after a few incomplete passes, Tannehill had his pass intended for receiver Legadu Naanee deflected by a defensive lineman and intercepted by linebacker Brian Cushing with (4:06) left in the second quarter. The Texans quickly turned the turnover into points, with an Arian Foster 14-yard rush. On the first play following the Houston kickoff quarterback Tannehill again had his pass deflected by a defensive lineman, but instead was intercepted by Kareem Jackson. After a defensive pass interference penalty, running back Arian Foster rushed for his second rushing touchdown of the game at the (0:49) mark. Again following the kickoff the Dolphins again turned the ball over following a Daniel Thomas fumble. The turnover was shortly followed by a 14-yard pass touchdown from Houston quarterback Matt Schaub to receiver Andre Johnson at the (0:12) mark. Following a quick three and out by the Texans following halftime, punt returner Marcus Thigpen returned a punt for 72 yards for a touchdown. But for the remainder of the game the Dolphins offense failed to produce any scores, but held the Texans defense to two Shayne Graham field goals: 40 and 19 yards, respectively.

Even though both teams tried really hard, they had a hard time scoring points at the beginning. But then, a player from the Texans, Johnathan Joseph, caught a ball that Tannehill threw, which is called an interception. That's like if you're playing catch with a friend, but someone else grabs the ball out of the air -- that changes the game! This interception let the Texans get close enough to score some points. As the game went on, the Dolphins made some more mistakes that let the Texans score more points. Then, after halftime, a player from the Dolphins named Marcus Thigpen ran really far with the ball to score a touchdown, but the Dolphins didn't manage to score any more after that.

Write an article based on this summary: Derry City winger Michael Duffy has completed his move to Celtic after passing a medical and agreeing personal terms with the Scottish champions.","completion":"Title: Michael Duffy Joins Celtic as They Secure a Skilled Winger Subtitle: Scottish Champions Celtic Add Derry City's Michael Duffy to their Roster Introduction: The Scottish champions, Celtic, have acquired Michael Duffy, the Derry City winger. Duffy successfully passed his medical examination and agreed to the personal terms, officially securing his place in the team. Step 1: Background of Michael Duffy Michael Duffy is an impressive football talent originating from Derry City. As a highly skilled winger, he has demonstrated exceptional abilities on the field and has been a key player for Derry City during his time there. His quick movements, versatility, and agility have impressed spectators and professionals alike. Step 2: The signing process Considering the skills and experience Michael Duffy brings to the table, Celtic was quick to express their interest in securing him for their team. After a period of negotiations, Duffy completed a medical examination, which is standard practice to ensure that a player is physically fit to join a new team. Having passed the medical, Duffy moved on to finalizing the personal terms of his move to Celtic. Step 3: The personal terms agreement The personal terms of a transfer deal usually include the player's salary, contract length, and other clauses that outline the player's rights and responsibilities within the team. In Duffy's case, both parties were satisfied with the negotiated terms, ultimately leading to an official agreement and Duffy's move to Celtic. Step 4: Impact of Duffy's move on Celtic Michael Duffy’s move to Celtic will undoubtedly bolster the team's offensive capabilities. His presence on the wing will provide the team with additional options in attack, while his pace and skill can create opportunities for his teammates as well. Duffy's signing is likely to bring increased competition within the team, pushing other players to improve and maintain their form in order to secure a spot in the starting lineup. Step 5: Derry City's response and future plans Derry City will certainly miss Michael Duffy's contributions to the team, but they will likely move forward with new strategies and possibly scout for potential new talent to fill the void left by Duffy. The transfer fee received from Celtic could be used to invest in the development of the club further, possibly upgrading facilities or strengthening their youth academy. Conclusion: With the signing of Michael Duffy, Celtic has added a valuable player to their team, strengthening their already formidable lineup. Duffy's transfer to the Scottish champions serves as a testament to his footballing abilities and achievements thus far in his career. Fans will surely be eager to see him showcase his skills in the Scottish Premiership and contribute to the team's continued success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Household uses for soaps include washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping, where soaps act as surfactants, emulsifying oils to enable them to be carried away by water. In industry they are also used in textile spinning and are important components of some lubricants. - A sulfonate is a salt or ester of a sulfonic acid. It contains the functional group R-SO. - A carboxylate is a salt or ester of a carboxylic acid. \\"Carboxylate salts\\" have the general formula M(RCOO), where M is a metal and \\"n\\" is 1, 2...; \\"carboxylate esters\\" have the general formula RCOOR. R and R are organic groups; R H. - Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants. - Wetting is the ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials in the past two decades (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotube). - Hard water is water that has high mineral content (in contrast with \\"soft water\\"). Hard water is formed when water percolates through deposits of limestone and chalk which are largely made up of calcium and magnesium carbonates. - A detergent is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with \\"cleaning properties in dilute solutions.\\" These substances are usually alkylbenzenesulfonates, a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard water, because the polar sulfonate (of detergents) is less likely than the polar carboxylate (of soap) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water. - Linear alkylbenzene is a family of organic compounds with the formula C6H5CnH2n +1 . Typically , n lies between 10 and 16 , although generally supplied as a tighter cut , such as C12 - C15 , C12 - C13 and C10 - C13 , for detergent use . The CnH2n +1 chain is unbranched .

Options: * no * yes","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Both sentences convey the same meaning, but they use slightly different wordings and sentence structures. Here's a breakdown of the similarities and differences between the two sentences: 1. Original sentence: The A40 - parallels of the M40 from London to Oxford and was for years the main road between the two cities as a precursor. 2. Paraphrased sentence: The A40 parallels the M40 from London to Oxford and for years was the main road between the two cities as its precursor. In both sentences, the main information is that the A40 runs parallel to the M40 between London and Oxford and served as the main road between the two cities before the M40 was constructed. The following points highlight their similarities and differences: - Both sentences mention the A40 and the M40. - Both sentences mention London and Oxford as the two cities connected by these roads. - Both sentences mention that the A40 was the main road between London and Oxford for years, before the M40. - The first sentence uses a hyphen to introduce the detail about the A40, while the second sentence uses a direct verb, \\"parallels,\\" to convey the same information. - The first sentence says \\"parallels of the M40,\\" an expression that may create ambiguity, whereas the second sentence more clearly states, \\"The A40 parallels the M40,\\" using a verb to indicate the relationship. - The first sentence says \\"as a precursor,\\" while the second sentence uses the possessive form, \\"as its precursor.\\" Both serve to indicate that the A40 was the precursor to the M40. Overall, both sentences express the same information about the A40 and M40 roads and their connection between London and Oxford. The similarities in meaning and slight differences in wording confirm that they are paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: What type of room is least common in the palace? Context: The palace measures 108 metres (354 ft) by 120 metres (390 ft), is 24 metres (79 ft) high and contains over 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft) of floorspace. The floor area is smaller than the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, or the Forbidden City. There are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The principal rooms are contained on the piano nobile behind the west-facing garden façade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the façade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and 55 yards (50 m) long. The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a tribune lined with tapestries.

Answer:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google does not directly answer the question \\"When is Passover over?\\" The information provided describes the background and reason for the celebration of Passover but does not give the specific end date or time.

Step 1: Determine the start date of Passover Passover starts on the 15th day of the Hebrew month of Nissan, which usually falls between March and April on the Gregorian calendar. The specific date varies each year. Step 2: Identify the length of Passover Passover is celebrated for 7 days in Israel and 8 days in the diaspora (outside of Israel).

Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert, who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room. Mary tries to tell her parents about it but they think she is not telling the truth.

Xiamen dialect, sometimes known as Amoy, is the main dialect spoken in the Chinese city of Xiamen and its surrounding regions of Tong'an and Xiang'an, both of which are now included in the Greater Xiamen area. This dialect developed in the late Ming dynasty when Xiamen was increasingly taking over Quanzhou's position as the main port of trade in southeastern China. Quanzhou traders began travelling southwards to Xiamen to carry on their businesses while Zhangzhou peasants began traveling northwards to Xiamen in search of job opportunities. It is at this time when a need for a common language arose. The Quanzhou and Zhangzhou varieties are similar in many ways (as can be seen from the common place of Henan Luoyang where they originated), but due to differences in accents, communication can be a problem. Quanzhou businessmen considered their speech to be the prestige accent and considered Zhangzhou's to be a village dialect. Over the centuries, dialect leveling occurred and the two speeches mixed to produce the Amoy dialect.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: In-text citations should be provided to readers immediately after you’ve quoted, paraphrased, or referred to information from a source. This will avoid any confusion about where the cited information comes from. The citation should come after the last word of the sentence but before the period. Put all in-text citations in parentheses. An APA in-text citation for the book Escaping Salem: The Other Witch Hunt of 1692 by Richard Godbeer (2005) would look like this: “While many people immediately think of Salem, Massachusetts when they are asked about witchcraft in America, trials took place in other communities, as well (Godbeer, 2005).” Your reference list (which comes at the end of your paper) will include more information on each source, including the title and publication location. If you’re citing 2 sources by the same author published in the exact same year, it’s important to differentiate between them. Label them with “a,” “b,” “c,” and so on right at the end of the in-text citation. For example, “(Godbeer, 2005a)” and “(Godbeer, 2005b).” If the sentence has lots of different clauses, it might get confusing for the reader if you put the citation all the way at the end of the line. Instead, include the citation at the end of the clause where you’ve referenced the source. For example, you might write, “Trials for witchcraft often targeted independent or single women (Godbeer, 2005); although there are many possible explanations for why communities might have accused people of practicing witchcraft.” Unlike some other citation styles (like Chicago), APA doesn’t make you include very much information in your in-text citations. If you’re citing a source with 1 identifiable author, all you need is the author’s last name and the publication date. Use “n.d.” (meaning “no date”) if no publication date is provided. When you’re quoting from a book rather than just referring to it or paraphrasing the author’s argument, page numbers are needed to tell your reader exactly where they can find the quotation. For a single page, use the letter “p” followed by a period: “p.” For more than one page, use two p’s followed by a period: “pp.” An in-text citation for a quotation would look like this: “The witchcraft trial in Stamford, Connecticut was very different from the one in Salem, Massachusetts. Community members avoided hysteria and “were for the most part remarkably cautious” during the trial (Godbeer, 2005, p. 7).” There might be times when you’d like to directly refer to the author in your sentence. Since you’ve done this, you don’t have to repeat the author’s last name in your in-text citation. Type out the publication date in parentheses immediately after you’ve stated the author’s name. If you’re quoting from a source, add the page numbers in parentheses at the end of the sentence. This type of in-text citation might look like this: “Godbeer (2005) argues that “seventeenth-century New Englanders believed their world was filled with supernatural forces” such as witchcraft” (pp. 144-145). If you’re citing 2 sources in the same sentence, it’s important to make that clear to your reader. You’ll need to include both authors’ last names and the publication dates of the 2 sources in parentheses at the end of the sentence. Order the 2 sources alphabetically within the parentheses. If you’re citing 2 sources by the same author, order them by their publication date, with older sources coming before newer ones. For example, perhaps you want to cite both Escaping Salem and The Devil in the Shape of a Woman: Witchcraft in Colonial New England (1998) by Carol F. Karlsen. Your in-text citation would look like this: “(Karlsen, 1998; Godbeer, 2005).” If you were citing Escaping Salem and Richard Godbeer’s earlier book, The Devil’s Dominion: Magic and Religion in Early New England (1992), your citation would look like this: “(Godbeer, 1992; Godbeer, 2005).” Summary:","completion":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on how to properly use in-text citations in APA style, detailing how to format citations for different situations, such as quoting, paraphrasing, citing multiple sources, and handling multiple works by the same author."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON — As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted. South Dakotans will decide whether to make statewide offices nonpartisan and create a citizens commission to redraw voting districts after each 10-year national census, removing...

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Carbaminohemoglobin About 20 percent of carbon dioxide is bound by hemoglobin and is transported to the lungs. Carbon dioxide does not bind to iron as oxygen does; instead, carbon dioxide binds amino acid moieties on the globin portions of hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin, which forms when hemoglobin and carbon dioxide bind. When hemoglobin is not transporting oxygen, it tends to have a bluish-purple tone to it, creating the darker maroon color typical of deoxygenated blood.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the algebraic equation -197 = 42*r + 223 for the variable r, you need to follow several steps to isolate r. Here's the detailed breakdown: 1. The original equation: -197 = 42*r + 223 2. Start by moving the constant term (223) to the other side by subtracting it from both sides of the equation: -197 - 223 = 42*r + 223 - 223 3. Simplify the equation: -420 = 42*r 4. Now, to isolate r, divide both sides by the coefficient of r, in this case, 42: -420 / 42 = 42*r / 42 5. Simplify the equation: -10 = r The solution to the given algebraic equation is r = -10."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Referring to the film as \\"bland\\" usually implies that the movie lacked distinct or unique qualities that would have made it more engaging or interesting. In a more detailed review, the critic might have provided specific examples of what made the movie feel bland. For instance, they could mention that the plot was predictable or clichéd, or that the characters were underdeveloped. Other factors that could have contributed to the film being perceived as bland include a slow pace, uninspired dialogue, or a lack of emotional depth. Moreover, the critic might have also pointed out any redeeming qualities or aspects of the movie that weren't necessarily bland but didn't manage to save the overall experience either. For instance, they could mention that while the cinematography or the acting were decent, these elements did not compensate for the weaknesses in the storyline or the character development.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The French actor was caught short on a Paris to Dublin flight after the seat belt sign had been switched on for take-off. With the lavatories closed, the 62-year-old called out \\"I need to piss, I need to piss\\". But the cabin crew said no. So the corpulent star of Cyrano de Bergerac, Jean de Florette and Green Card decides to take matters into his own hands. It is understood the movie star got out of his seat and tried to relieve himself into an empty bottle at the back of the plane but also peed on the floor. While the scene may have brought the house down in French cinema theatres, the real-life incident failed to raise a laugh on Tuesday from irate passengers of the Dublin-based City Jet airline; they were told Mr Depardieu's antics meant the plane would be grounded for two hours while staff cleaned the carpet. The French star, who was travelling with two companions, was thrown off the flight with his luggage and told to book another one. Friends of the actor said he was “completely sober” but desperate to relieve himself. At first he was told he had 15 minutes to wait, but then due to congestion on the runway, he was informed he would have to endure another 20 minutes, they said. Given his “irrepressible need”, his two travel companions, including the French actor Edouard Baer, offered him an empty bottle as a last resort. They said he had no choice but to use it, but that he did it “without any provocation and after making sure he wasn’t seen”. A little urine was spilt on the floor, which the actor offered to clean up himself, saying he was “sorry” for the inconvenience caused, they said. “No proceedings or fine were signalled to him and he had the feeling the misunderstanding and the inflexible attitude of the hostess were understood by his interlocutors,” they said. An outraged female passenger told France's Europe 1 radio: \\"Mr Depardieu got up, calling out 'I need to piss, I need to piss'\\" as the plane was heading to the runway. \\"The air hostess replied: 'I am sorry, you'll have to wait 15 minutes until we are in the air, everyone is strapped in, the lavatories are shut, I can do nothing for you.' \\"He said: 'No, I cannot wait.' He got up, and did it on the ground. \\"The hostess was shocked, but nothing was said – everything was done courteously.\\" \\"Mr Depardieu sat down again, and we went back to the plane parking space.\\" The passengers said she was \\"outraged\\" by an actor who \\"thinks he is not like others, that he has to abide by their rules. He could've waited a couple of minutes.\\" City Jet confirmed that an incident took place but declined to name the individual involved. On Twitter, CityJet chose to see the funny side of the incident. \\"As you may have seen on the news, we are busy mopping the floor of one of our planes this morning...,\\" read a first message. A second read: \\"We'd also like to remind all passengers that our planes are fully equipped with toilet facilities...\\" Mr Depardieu's agent said he declined to comment on the incident. This is by no means the famously tempestuous food and wine-loving star's first brush with controversy. In 2005, he smoked on a Jonathan Ross chat show on BBC ONE, and branded his fellow countrymen a bunch of \\"cretins\\". Later that year he knocked out a paparazzo with a headbutt after he photographed him with a female companion. Last year, he called a female TV journalist a \\"slut\\" after she asked a question about his deceased son, Guillaume, then dubbed his fellow French male actors \\"narcissistic\\" and \\"self-satisfied\\". A real actor, he said was one who \\"has vomit on him, who stinks, who has just crapped a bit out of fear.\\" Then he caused a furore last August by branding Oscar-winning French actress Juliette Binoche a \\"nothing\\" and a \\"nobody\\". This drew a fierce response from French actors, one of whom, Annie Duperey said: \\"Gérard Depardieu talks rubbish. At this stage of his fame and drunkenness he thinks anything goes. \\"He was a great actor but he should shut his mouth.\\" Mr Depardieu was voted France's third most irritating celebrity in a 2010 poll, behind First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy and film star Alain Delon. Although lauded as a genius at his best, he has often been criticised for agreeing to appear in countless flops. Indeed, he recently admitted: \\"I've made 200 films, of which 150 were crap\\". He had epic, public spats with his son Guillaume, who died three years ago and who described his father as a \\"coward, a cheat and lazy\\" in his autobiography, Tout Donner (Giving Everything). On a chat show in May, he repeated over and again in slurred speech: \\"I am a piece of garbage.\\" ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A French actor really needed to pee during a flight from Paris to Dublin, but the seatbelt sign was on and the toilets were closed.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. Question: Who takes feedback? Answer: Answer:","completion":"Taking feedback is an essential process for everyone, regardless of their background, profession, or personal disposition. It allows individuals to grow, learn from their mistakes, and continuously improve in various aspects of their lives. While it is true that some people may be more receptive to feedback, this is not a quality reserved for specific personality types or levels of expertise. People with varying confidence levels and experiences can take feedback and utilize its value to achieve their personal and professional goals. Confident individuals may find it easier to accept feedback as they believe in their abilities and social standing. They understand that feedback is a tool that can help them fine-tune their skills and further their growth. However, even these individuals may occasionally feel the sting of criticism, as nobody is infallible or impervious to mistakes. On the other hand, people experiencing imposter syndrome or those who are new in their careers may find it more challenging to accept negative feedback. Insecurities about one's abilities and performance can compound the sting of critical comments. However, feedback can still be valuable for such individuals, as it can provide an opportunity to learn, adjust, and develop their skills, ultimately increasing their confidence in the long run. Recognizing the value of feedback relies on a balanced self-perception, in which individuals have confidence in their abilities to improve and achieve their goals, while also acknowledging their current limitations and weaknesses. This mindset allows for an openness to learning and growth, as well as the self-awareness to seek and accept the counsel and guidance of others. To harness the power of feedback and turn it into a growth tool, individuals should actively seek opportunities to learn from their experiences and mistakes. This approach can be facilitated through soliciting feedback, engaging in reflective self-assessment, and implementing changes based on the received input. Ultimately, anyone can take feedback, but how they respond and act upon it determines the extent to which they can truly benefit from it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: Information: - The Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus. The now-current name is due to William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054, the nebula was observed later by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion. - The Crab Pulsar ( PSR B0531 +21 ) is a relatively young neutron star . The star is the central star in the Crab Nebula , a remnant of the supernova SN 1054 , which was widely observed on Earth in the year 1054 . Discovered in 1968 , the pulsar was the first to be connected with a supernova remnant . The Crab Pulsar is one of very few pulsars to be identified optically . The optical pulsar is roughly 20 km in diameter and the pulsar \`\` beams '' rotate once every 33 milliseconds , or 30 times each second . The outflowing relativistic wind from the neutron star generates synchrotron emission , which produces the bulk of the emission from the nebula , seen from radio waves through to gamma rays . The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar 's equatorial wind slams into the surrounding nebula , forming a termination shock . The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly , with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp - like features that steepen , brighten , then fade as they move away from the pulsar into the main body of the nebula . The period of the pulsar 's rotation is slowing by 38 nanoseconds per day due to the large amounts of energy carried away in the pulsar wind . The Crab Nebula is often used as a calibration source in X-ray astronomy . It is very bright in X-rays and the flux density and spectrum are known to be constant , with the exception of the pulsar itself . The pulsar provides a strong periodic signal that is used to check the timing of the X-ray detectors . In X-ray astronomy , ' crab ' and ' millicrab ' are sometimes used as units of flux density . A millicrab corresponds to a flux density of about 2.4x10 11 erg s 1 cm 2 ( 2.4x10 14 W m 2 ) in the 2 -- 10 keV X-ray band , for a \`\` crab - like '' X-ray spectrum , which is roughly a powerlaw in photon energy , I ( E ) = 9.5 E 1.1 . Very few X-ray sources ever exceed one crab in brightness . - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.

Does the sentence \\"A peace deal between warring parties was reached in 1995, leading to Taylor's election as president in 1997.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did the economic community monitoring group do to intervene in the crisis?\\"","completion":"The sentence \\"A peace deal between warring parties was reached in 1995, leading to Taylor's election as president in 1997.\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) do to intervene in the crisis?\\" The sentence only provides information on the outcome of a peace deal and its subsequent effects on a political election. However, it is essential to explore the role of ECOMOG to understand their efforts to intervene in the crisis. ECOMOG, a multinational military force assembled by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), played a significant role in resolving various conflicts in West Africa, including the Liberian Civil War. Here is a detailed account of ECOMOG's intervention in the crisis: 1. Deployment of troops: ECOMOG, led by Nigeria, deployed troops to Liberia in 1990 to restore peace and stability in the country, which was devastated by a civil war. The objective was to implement a ceasefire between various warring factions and facilitate the establishment of an interim government. 2. Humanitarian efforts: ECOMOG was involved in providing humanitarian and logistical assistance to Liberian citizens affected by the conflict. They ensured the delivery of relief materials, facilitated medical aid, and helped to restore essential infrastructure required to support the population. 3. Neutralizing warring factions: ECOMOG forces actively sought to neutralize the influence of various armed groups, including Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and other factions, which were responsible for the atrocities committed during the civil war. They employed diplomatic and military strategies to minimize violence and achieve relative peace in the region. 4. Peace negotiations: ECOMOG played a significant role in mediating peace negotiations between the warring parties. They facilitated several rounds of peace talks and played a crucial role in forging agreements such as the Cotonou Accord (1993), the Abuja Agreements (1995), among others. These engagements led to the eventual peace deal in 1995, which the original sentence alluded to, and laid the foundation for the 1997 election. 5. Supervision of disarmament: ECOMOG monitored the disarmament and demobilization of armed groups, ensuring compliance with the agreed-upon conditions set forth in the peace agreements. This process was essential in preventing a resurgence of violence and fostering an environment conducive for democratic governance. 6. Election assistance: In the lead-up to the 1997 election, ECOMOG played a vital role in creating a secure environment for elections to take place. They provided security for election officials and voters, monitored the election process to ensure fairness, and facilitated the logistics necessary for a successful poll. In conclusion, the sentence provided does not properly address the role of ECOMOG in intervening in the crisis. It is essential to highlight the military, humanitarian, and diplomatic efforts of the group in quelling violence, supporting the citizens, and helping to pave the way for a return to democracy in Liberia. ECOMOG's involvement in Liberia was instrumental in achieving the eventual peace deal and setting the stage for the 1997 election."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you are given a passage and a question regarding that passage.

Passage: Immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude. Many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time. The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between \\"cellular\\" and \\"humoral\\" theories of immunity. According to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff, it was cells – more precisely, phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses. In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held, among others, by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring, stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism’s “humors” rather than its cells.

The central square in Covent Garden is simply called \\"Covent Garden\\", often marketed as \\"Covent Garden Piazza\\" to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or piazza with low railings. From about 1635 onwards there were many private residents of note, including the nobility, living in the Great Piazza. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site's owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones's design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d'Arme, in Leghorn, Tuscany, Piazza San Marco in Venice, Piazza Santissima Annunziata in Florence, and the Place des Vosges in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the Ladbroke Estate and the Grosvenor Estate. Isaac de Caus, the French Huguenot architect, designed the individual houses under Jones's overall design.The church of St Paul's was the first building, and was begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637. Seventeen of the houses had arcaded portico walks organised in groups of four and six either side of James Street on the north side, and three and four either side of Russell Street. These arcades, rather than the square itself, took the name Piazza; the group from James Street to Russell Street became known as the \\"Great Piazza\\" and that to the south of Russell Street as the \\"Little Piazza\\".

Answer: Louis Moinet invented the chronograph in 1816 Question: what is a chronograph watch Answer:","completion":"A chronograph watch is a specialized type of timepiece that combines the traditional watch functions, such as displaying the current time, with a stopwatch feature, allowing for the precise measurement of elapsed time intervals. Chronograph watches are highly valued for their practicality, accuracy, and often sporty appearance. Over the years, they have become an essential tool for anyone involved in aviation, sports, or other activities where timing is crucial. The term \\"chronograph\\" comes from the Greek words \\"chronos,\\" which means time, and \\"graph,\\" which means record. As the name suggests, a chronograph watch records periods of time through its stopwatch functionality, while also continuing to function as a regular watch. Chronograph watches typically consist of a main watch face with an additional set of sub-dials (known as complications) that display the stopwatch measurements. These sub-dials may record the seconds, minutes, and hours elapsed, depending on the specific design of the watch. Furthermore, there are usually two or more buttons (pushers) located on the side of the watch case, which control the start, stop, and reset functions of the chronograph. Louis Moinet is credited with inventing the chronograph in 1816, and his purpose was to create a tool for astronomers to measure the passage of celestial bodies accurately. However, it wasn't until 1821 that the first chronograph wristwatch was developed by Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec, who sought to create a device that could record the times of different horse races. Since then, the chronograph has evolved significantly and has been adopted across many industries and professions due to its versatility and usefulness. Nowadays, chronograph watches are available in a wide variety of styles, materials, and features, ranging from entry-level models to high-end luxury watches with intricate mechanical movements. They often include additional features, such as tachymeters (for measuring speed), telemeters (for measuring distance), and even water-resistance capabilities, making them suitable for various activities and sports. In summary, a chronograph watch is a type of timepiece that offers both traditional watch functions and stopwatch capabilities for measuring elapsed time. From its inception in 1816, the chronograph has become an indispensable tool across many fields, fulfilling various timing needs and even advancing into the realm of high fashion and luxury accessories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: Which English Monarch was created ‘Defender of the Faith’ by Pope Leo X?","completion":"The English monarch who was bestowed the title \\"Defender of the Faith\\" by Pope Leo X was King Henry VIII. This declaration was made on October 11, 1521, and it played a significant role in shaping the religious and political landscape of England during that period. King Henry VIII (1491-1547) was the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty and ruled England from 1509 until his death. He is primarily remembered for his six marriages, his desire for a male heir, and his subsequent establishment of the Church of England after a volatile break away from the Roman Catholic Church. The title \\"Defender of the Faith\\" (in Latin, \\"Fidei Defensor\\" or \\"Fidei Defensatrix\\" for a queen regnant) was originally granted by Pope Leo X to King Henry VIII as a recognition of his loyalty and commitment to the Roman Catholic Church. In particular, it was an acknowledgment of the King's publication titled \\"Assertio Septem Sacramentorum\\" or \\"Defense of the Seven Sacraments.\\" In this book, Henry VIII defended the teachings and sacraments of the Catholic Church against the Protestant Reformation, which was initiated by the German theologian Martin Luther. Consequently, the Pope granted him the honorific title as a symbol of appreciation for defending the Church against the rise of Protestantism. However, the relationship between King Henry VIII and the Roman Catholic Church later deteriorated. The King's quest for a male heir and his desire to annul his marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, led to a series of events that would ultimately result in England breaking away from the Catholic Church. The Pope's refusal to grant the annulment became the catalyst for the English Reformation, as Henry VIII sought to establish his own church in which he could exercise complete religious and political control. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy was passed, declaring King Henry VIII as the Supreme Head of the Church of England, severing ties with the Roman Catholic Church and the papacy. Despite this break from Rome, King Henry VIII maintained the title \\"Defender of the Faith\\" for himself and his successors, as it had become an integral part of the English monarchy's identity and authority. Today, the reigning British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, still carries the title \\"Defender of the Faith\\" as part of her official title: \\"Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.\\" The significance of the title has evolved over time, and it now represents the Crown's responsibility to uphold and protect the religious freedom of its citizens and also maintain the established Church of England."},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Why are you study habits different from those of your friends? Why do you seem to learn faster in some classes while more slowly in others? One reason you may not know is that people have different types. Scientists say there are three different learning types: Visual ,Auditory ,and Kinesthetic . Visual learners learn best by seeing. If you seem to easily remember information from pictures, graphs ,and videos, you are probably a visual learner. You're not good at copying down what the teacher says in class. Never mind. You can draw graphs or pictures instead, if you find that works better for you. Auditory learners learn best by hearing. If you seem to easily remember things by hearing them, then you are probably an auditory learner. You must listen carefully while the teacher is speaking because it's the easiest way for you to learn . Sometimes you may find that taking notes tops you from listening carefully. After class, you can write down what you remember or borrow your friend's notes to copy. Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. If you seem to learn best by working with your hands, you are probably a kinesthetic learner. Taking notes by writing can make you pay close attention to information as you receive it.

DeMille Biblical slaughter fest. The script doesn't just set up action scenes, it also develops the relationship of the three sergeants with great dollops of humor. The main focus is on Sgt. Cutter, chasing after tall tales of golden treasures. It's a rare actioner for Cary Grant, and his lightness is just right for a film that never takes itself seriously even as it develops taut suspense. Anchoring the trio is Sgt. MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), who dotes over his elephant Annie and tries to protect Cutter from his own hare-brained schemes. He's just as funny in his own way, leaving Sgt. Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr., displaying some nice Errol Flynnish dash) as the one with the love interest and grounding enough to know he needs to chuck his boyish pals and grow up. If \\"Gunga Din\\" was a Lifetime movie, it would be about Joan Fontaine's efforts to save her man from his two loser friends and their skull crushing hijinks. But since it's a guys' film, the accent here is on how the threesome must stay together and save Ballantine from a fate worse than death, not only marriage, but as Cutter indignantly exclaims several times, the tea business, too. The political correctness police are hard on this film, not so much for the gender issue but the idea of British soldiers saving poor Indians from the vicious Thuggies. It reeks of colonial apologia. Thankfully, this film was made back when, and the producers thus felt no need to spell out the obvious liberalism at the heart of the film, that these three sergeants, so full of derring-do and false racial pride, have to be saved along with the rest of their army by a humble bhisti that only one of the three had any time for when he sought their approval. After all, for all their swashbuckling glory, the film's true sacrifice involves the title character, played so heart-wrenchingly by Sam Jaffe. Back when this film was made, movie mogul Jack Warner had a saying: You want to send a message, use Western Union. Still, it seems like the messages were flying fast and furious in \\"Gunga Din.\\" I watch the film now and wonder if audiences back then were meant to wonder what Gunga Din was really up to when he led Cutter to the golden temple. Was he really plotting revenge against his British overlords? Would he have been justified in doing so, especially given MacChesney's cold treatment of him? When Col. Weed delivers that eulogy, the poem by Rudyard Kipling on which the film is loosely based, was it with a nod in the direction of imperialism's folly, of lording it over someone who proved \\"a better man than I am\\" in the end? What did they make of the Guru's great speech, delivered in perfect clipped English: \\"You have sworn an oath as soldiers to maybe die for a faith, which is your country, England. Well, I can die for my country and my faith as readily as you...India, farewell.\\" Of course, the same character also instructs his brutal followers: \\"Kill for the love of killing! Kill for the love of Kali! Kill! Kill! Kill!\\" Which means we are allowed to hate him and root for the British, and save the questions about what it all means for later. What \\"Gunga Din\\" means to me, most of all, is the quickest, surest 90-minute thrill ride on video. Cutter never found his golden temple, but there's one for all of us watching \\"Gunga Din.\\" Available choices: - negative - positive","completion":"The correct sentiment of this review is: positive"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This movie contains what Hemmingway described as the \\"iceberg effect\\". On the surface, its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie. If this would be written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast paced, and unless you actually try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with some subtle foreshadowing) can very well pass you by. Definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate. Experimental Cinematography barely describes this movie. The camera-work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film, making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others (something to be desired in American movies as of late). Although, at some parts it may get a little raunchy, gruesome and too heavy for some audiences, the movie never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the movie that I would write off as \\"needs improvement\\" is the soundtrack selection. No movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite fitting, the opening is a little too long, and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate (heavy, grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip). The flooding of imagery and dynamic... color palettes adds another \\"artistic\\" aspect to it, also combined with the events that happen throughout the film, this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand. However, that also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch, and not one you'll quickly get bored of. 8.5/10 Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

The yellow purse tucked under her arm is presented at such an angle that it is suggestive of female genitalia.In the next scene, outraged business owner Sidney Strutt (Martin Gabel) rants to a pair of detectives that he was \\"cleaned out\\" by a female employee named Marion Holland whom he obviously hired for her looks despite her lack of professional references. A client of Strutt's, Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), overhears the conversation and says that he remembers this woman, wryly referring to her as \\"the brunette with the legs.\\"The woman, real name Marnie Edgar (Tippi Hedren) is a compulsive thief, and has made off with almost 10,000 stashed in the yellow purse. She changes her appearance, going from brunette to blonde, and flees with the cash, journeying south to a town in Virginia where she keeps her beloved horse, Forio, stabled. She then visits her mother Bernice (Louise Latham) in Baltimore. She lavishes her mother with expensive gifts in an attempt to impress her and win her love, but the woman is cold and distant with Marnie, showing much more maternal affection towards a little neighbor girl named Jessie whom she babysits. Marnie's intense jealousy of Jessie seems inappropriate for a grown woman to express, and along with her panic over a bouquet of red gladiolas and her mother's insistence that \\"decent\\" women don't need men, the first hints of the dysfunction that drives Marnie to lie and steal appear.Time goes by and Marnie constructs a new identity, Mary Taylor, with the intent to run her scam again on another victim. She applies for a job at a printing company in Philadelphia owned by none other than Mark Rutland. Despite her now chestnut hair, he recognizes Marnie as the woman who stole from Strutt, but, excited by the thrill of chasing and capturing the attractive criminal, he hires her.

He encourages her to face her fears and uncover the childhood trauma that he suspects has led to her criminal behavior. The entire film is a roller coaster ride as Mark and Marnie both struggle with past secrets and the question of whether love and understanding are enough to overcome a troubled past.

How do you do this: How do you clean tennis shoes?","completion":"Cleaning tennis shoes is an important task to maintain their appearance and performance. To ensure that your tennis shoes are properly cleaned, follow these steps: 1. Gather materials: Before starting, gather all the necessary supplies, which include: - A soft brush (such as an old toothbrush or a specialized shoe brush) - A cloth or sponge - Mild laundry detergent or shoe cleaner - Warm water - A soft, dry cloth or paper towels - A bowl or container large enough to hold water and detergent - Optional: a washing machine, laundry bag, and fabric softener sheet (for machine-washing) 2. Remove loose dirt: Begin by removing any loose dirt or debris from your tennis shoes. Gently tap the shoes together or against a hard surface to remove large particles. Then, using the soft brush, gently brush away dirt from the surface of the shoes. Pay particular attention to the soles, where dirt and debris are more likely to accumulate. 3. Prepare the cleaning solution: In the bowl or container, mix a small amount of mild laundry detergent or specialized shoe cleaner with warm water. Stir the solution until it forms a soapy mixture. Avoid using harsh chemicals, bleach, or hot water, as these can damage your tennis shoes. 4. Start cleaning: Dip the cloth or sponge in the cleaning solution and gently scrub the surface of your tennis shoes in a circular motion. Work on one small area at a time, applying a little pressure to remove dirt and stains. Be careful not to saturate the shoes, especially if they are made of leather or suede. 5. Clean the soles: Use the soft brush dipped in the cleaning solution to scrub the soles and any grooves or crevices where dirt might be trapped. Ensure you thoroughly clean the areas around the sole and upper part of the shoe. 6. Rinse and dry: Wipe off any soap residue with a clean, damp cloth or sponge. Rinse the cloth or sponge in clean water to ensure the soap is removed from the shoes. Do not immerse your tennis shoes in water, as this can damage them further. 7. Air dry: Use the dry cloth or paper towels to pat your shoes dry. Then let them air dry away from direct sunlight or heat sources, such as radiators or heaters. Direct heat can cause your tennis shoes to shrink or warp. Removing the insoles and laces and propping the shoes open can help speed up the drying process. 8. Optional machine-washing: If your tennis shoes are machine-washable, make sure to check the manufacturer’s instructions for care. Remove the laces and insoles, and place your shoes in a laundry bag. Add a fabric softener sheet to help reduce potential damage. Use cold water and a gentle cycle to wash the shoes. Air dry the shoes afterward as in step 7. 9. Reassemble: Once your tennis shoes are completely dry, reinsert the insoles and re-lace them. Your tennis shoes are now ready for use. By following these steps, you will be able to keep your tennis shoes clean and in good condition, ensuring a better performance on the court and an overall longer lifespan for the footwear."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A planet that is smaller has less gravity or more gravity? Answer:","completion":"A planet that is smaller in size usually has less mass, and therefore, it would typically have less gravity. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. The force of gravity between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them, as described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation: F = G * ((m1*m2) / r^2), where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers. 2. A smaller planet usually has a lower mass compared to a larger planet. 3. Since objects with greater mass have a stronger force of gravity between them, smaller planets, which have lower mass, would generally have a weaker force of gravity. 4. Therefore, a planet that is smaller has less gravity, considering all other factors being equal (such as distance to other celestial bodies)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Translation in any language needs to consider many different factors, including but not limited to, the context, the intended audience, and the specific terminologies used. Translating English to French can be somewhat straightforward because they have a lot of commonalities, as both languages are part of the Indo-European languages family and they share the same alphabet. Yet there are also some major differences that make translation a bit tricky. First of all, French and English grammars are not the same. French has a different word order than English. For instance, whereas in English one might say \\"blue cat,\\" in French one would say \\"cat blue,\\" or \\"chat bleu.\\" Similarly, French uses gender for nouns, which English does not. Secondly, there are lots of words in English that have many synonyms, which is not always the case in French. So, a translator needs to make sure that they choose the right equivalent in French, which conveys the same meaning as in English. Furthermore, the translator should also maintain the formality or informality of the text, as French has a formal and an informal way of addressing people, which is not the case in English. Regarding the translation of your sentence: \\"Arrangements for and expected operation of the Eighteenth Meeting of the Parties.\\", the French equivalent: \\"Dispositions pour et fonctionnement prévu de la dix-huitième Réunion des Parties.\\" tries to preserve the same meaning and the formal tone of the original sentence. \\"Dispositions pour\\" means \\"Arrangements for\\", \\"fonctionnement prévu\\" translates to \\"expected operation\\", \\"de la\\" means \\"of the\\", \\"dix-huitième\\" translates to \\"eighteenth\\", and \\"Réunion des Parties.\\" is \\"Meeting of the Parties.\\" Therefore, it is always important to consider these factors while translating.

Getting started: Once Carson felt confident in their decision to pursue a lawn care service as a means of making money, they would need to take the necessary steps to launch the service. This could involve creating promotional materials, like flyers or business cards, getting the word out through personal networks, or using social media to reach a wider audience. In summary, before knocking on the door and negotiating a price to mow someone's yard, Carson needed to decide to try to make some money (Option 3). This decision was likely informed by personal goals and motivations, an exploration of potential opportunities, an assessment of their skills and resources, the creation of a basic business plan, and finally, taking the necessary steps to get started with their lawn care service."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Steeleye Span are an English folk rock band formed in 1969. Still active today, along with Fairport Convention, they are amongst the best known acts of the British folk revival, and were among the most commercially successful, thanks to their hit singles \\"Gaudete\\" and \\"All Around My Hat\\". They had four Top 40 albums and achieved a certified gold record with sales of \\"All Around My Hat\\". Throughout their history, Steeleye Span have seen many personnel changes. Reported difficulties among band members saw a split during the recording of Bedlam Born. Woods reportedly was uncomfortable with the financial arrangements of the band, health problems forced Johnson into retirement, and drummer Dave Mattacks' period as an unofficial member came to an end during this time. For a while the band consisted of just Peter Knight and Tim Harries, plus various guest musicians, as they fulfilled live commitments. Rick Kemp resumed playing with the band at some of these gigs, with Harries switching to lead guitar. This was an uncertain time for the future of the band, and when Harries announced he was not keen to continue his role, even the willingness of Kemp to return to the line-up full-time was not enough to prevent what was effectively a break-up. In 2002, Steeleye Span reformed with a \\"classic\\" line-up (including Prior), bringing an end to the uncertainty of the previous couple of years. Knight hosted a poll on his website, asking the band's fans which Steeleye songs they would most want to see the band re-record. Armed with the results, Knight persuaded Prior and Genockey to rejoin, coaxed Johnson out of a health-induced retirement, and along with Kemp and Knight, they released Present--The Very Best of Steeleye Span (2002), a 2-disc set of new recordings of the songs. But Bob Johnson's health prevented him from playing live shortly before the 2002 comeback tour, and he was replaced at the eleventh hour on guitar by Ken Nicol, formerly of the Albion Band. Nicol had been talking with Rick Kemp about forming a band when Kemp invited him to play for the tour, and this was to herald a significant return to form for the band.

Therefore, deadheading your irises is important because you can remove your irises from their plants, even if it means only collecting once a month. You can use a dehumidifier, work the flowers at night, and then you can blow off dead heads.. 3). The flower heads scatter and die off from the death of the plant. Deadheading flowers with weeds can be considered deadheading, as this is when you remove dead flowers from their stems and leaves and make sure they die off at the same time the flowers die and grow fresh flowers.. 4). This process means you can tend to spent and undamaged flowers before the flowers are fully established in the ground.

Producing seeds takes up a plants energy that could otherwise be put towards producing new growth. Deadheading also help to tidy up your garden and get rid of withered, faded flower petals. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: 2). This answer is confusing and not directly related to deadheading irises. It unnecessarily suggests using a dehumidifier and working only at night. Moreover, \\"blowing off dead heads\\" is not a proper description of deadheading. 3). The focus of this answer is diffuse, and it incorrectly implies that deadheading involves removing the entire stem and leaves. Deadheading specifically refers to removing spent flowers. 4). This answer drifts away from the topic of deadheading and into dormancy, complicating our understanding of the process. It does not provide a clear explanation of why deadheading is necessary for irises."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

What is the answer?","completion":"The third director who co-founded the Triangle Film Corporation in 1915 was Mack Sennett. Mack Sennett, born as Michael Sinnott on January 17, 1880 in Quebec, Canada, was an influential player in the early days of silent comedy. He was most renowned for his creation of the Keystone Studios, recognized for its wacky style of slapstick comedy. Sennett, considered as the originator of slapstick comedy in film, was famously known as the 'King of Comedy'. Sennett began his career in the film industry as an actor but found his calling behind the camera, as a director and also, an innovative producer. His notable contribution to filmmaking techniques, particularly in the field of comedy, propelled his career ahead to the point where he was co-founder of one of Hollywood's earliest and significant film studios, Triangle Film Corporation. Teaming up with Thomas Ince and D. W. Griffith, Hollywood’s prominent producers, they established Triangle Film Corporation in the summer of 1915. The name 'triangle' symbolized the trio's intent to 'do things in threes', accounting for the three very different sorts of motion pictures produced by the three subdivisions: Keystone Film Company (led by Sennett), New York Motion Picture Company (led by Ince) and Majestic Studio (led by Griffith). The incorporation of Triangle Film Corporation was considered a significant event, meant to revolutionize the film landscape by adding a degree of prestige to the movie industry, not just as cheap entertainment. It aimed for higher production quality, longer films, and better stories. And, although it faced downfall just a few years later, the Corporation’s influence on the film industry was certainly substantial, launching careers of several stars and introducing superior production techniques. The effort put in by the three co-founders, including Mack Sennett, thus certainly played a pivotal role in shaping the future of cinema."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],E={key:0},j={key:1};function q(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
