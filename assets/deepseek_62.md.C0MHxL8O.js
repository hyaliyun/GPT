User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? It's important to get away from all the typical routines in order to foster creativity. The idea of changing it up is a common one amongst successful and creative thinkers. This means that you either create a specific ritual around creativity, or that you simply find a way to take a break. Take a shower. There is something weirdly conducive about showering, as anyone who's had that amazing idea while stuck in the shower (only to forget it when you finally locate a pen and paper). If you're stuck on an idea, hop in the shower, with a pen and some paper handy and see what comes up. Go for a walk. Like showering, something about walking fosters creativity. Whether it's taking a walk as a prelude to getting started with your creative project, or as part of the project itself, taking a walk will help get those creative juices flowing. Steve Jobs used to hold walking meetings to brainstorm ideas. Tchaikovsky took several walks around his village before working on his latest creation. Create psychological distance between your normal routine and the time for creativity. Writer Toni Morrison always watched the sun come up in the morning before she would begin writing. She felt that this enabled her to access her creativity. . Throwing out tons of different ideas, especially ideas that might seem slightly off-the-wall can be a great idea to pick out a few really good ideas. Brainstorming helps to open up your thinking so that you aren't stuck in the same old thought patterns. The brainstorming stage isn't about what is or isn't feasible. Avoid limiting yourself when you're brainstorming. This is the time when all ideas are welcome, no matter how silly or unworkable they sound. If you start limiting yourself during this stage of the thinking game, you aren't going to progress very far. Avoid saying things to yourself during this phase that will shut down creativity rather than encourage it. Catch yourself anytime you say: \\"That won't work,\\" \\"We haven't done it that way before,\\" \\"We can't solve this problem,\\" \\"We don't have enough time.\\" For example: say you get stuck while writing your new story. Instead of obsessing over the next stage of the story, start thinking throwing out ideas for what might happen next, or how the story might progress if there were no boundaries on what you could write (even if you needed to change the ending to make the story possible). Part of finding creative solutions and ideas stems from looking at the problem or project in a new way. Looking at something in a new way allows you to look at new possible solutions that you might not otherwise have considered. Fortunately, there are some concrete aids to re-conceptualizing that you can drawn on. Turn the problem upside down. This can be done literally or figuratively; turning a picture upside down can actually make it easier to draw, because your brain has to look at it in terms of it's makings rather than what it thinks should be there. This works for more conceptual problems. For example, if you're writing a book and you can't figure out how to get the protagonist to a certain spot in the story, ask yourself \\"does this character actually need to be the protagonist? how would the story work with a different character as protagonist? or more than one character?\\"). Work backwards. Sometimes what you need is to focus on the solution first, and build backwards from that solution. For example: say you work in the advertising position at a newspaper. The paper is losing money because it hasn't been getting enough ads. Start from the final, best outcome (having lots of the right kind of ads). Work backwards by contacting the types of businesses and groups that can provide the best, most cost-effective ads. Daydreaming helps you to make connections and form patterns and recall information. This is key when you're thinking outside the box, because daydreaming can help you make connections that you might not otherwise have considered. So often your best ideas seem to come out of nowhere while you're daydreaming. Give yourself time to daydream. Turn off the computer, t.v., and your phone. If you're constantly plugged into distractions it will be much harder for your brain to rest and make connections. You can daydream while on that walk, or in the shower (this is one reason taking time to go for a walk or shower can be so conducive to creative thinking). Daydream in the morning before you have to get up, or at night before you fall asleep. Sometimes if you're having difficulty thinking outside the box, it's time to give yourself some basic parameters. This may seem like it would hinder creativity, but if you set the right parameters you'll find that it can actually open things up for you. Starting too broad can put too much pressure on you. For example: instead of saying \\"how can I increase ad sales\\" ask questions like \\"how can I encourage ad growth from businesses in the community? what can I do to make ads in our paper seem like a good option?\\" or \\"how can I target the businesses most likely to place ads in our paper?\\" or \\"what compensations can I use to encourage businesses to advertise?\\" You're still asking open questions and still considering a wide variety of options, but you're anchoring your ideas to a specific question or task. This will help you come up with more specific ideas. As another example: instead of asking yourself \\"how can I make my young adult novel different than the others on the market?\\" you consider more specific parts of the story: \\"who is the main character? is this main character just like every other main character (white, heterosexual, pretty but doesn't know it?)?\\" or if it's a fantasy novel \\"what is the magic system like? is it the vague paganesque, witchy magic that is popping up all over the YA section?\\" Or you could tell yourself that you have to rewrite a scene in your story only now the character doesn't have access to their magic. How are they going to get out of the situation? Fear is what holds back creativity. Fear is what makes you stick the paths that you know the best. When you consider the worst case scenario not only can you plan for it, but you can also convince yourself that the worst case scenario isn't bad enough that you shouldn't try. For the ad person example: you might consider what will happen if you try to implement a creative new scheme to offer incentives for long-time advertising partners (like better placement in the layout, a full color ad for a reduced price, etc.). Perhaps the worst that could happen is that no one takes the offer, or that you lose money because of it. Come up with plans for how you might deal with these potential setbacks. For the novel-writing example: your worst case scenario might be that no publisher or agent wants to market your novel because what they actually want is a clone of the latest YA bestseller.

Please answer the following question: It was another landmark week in the presidency of Donald Trump. He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference. Trump also received more good news this week when his choice for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, finally won Senate confirmation. There were, however, some significant setbacks as well, including the withdrawal of Ronny Jackson as the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs and intense congressional...

A:","completion":"The best answer choice to the question \\"What sort of molecules are used for absorbing light energy by plants?\\" is \\"complex.\\" To explain further, plants rely on a process called photosynthesis to convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy, which is stored in the form of carbohydrates. This process is essential for growth, development, and reproduction of the plant. Photosynthesis requires several key components to function, with one of the most important being pigments that can absorb light energy. Chlorophyll is the primary pigment found in photosynthetic organisms like plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. It is responsible for absorbing light energy from the sun and converting it into the chemical energy needed to fuel the plant's metabolic processes. Chlorophyll molecules can be found within specialized structures called chloroplasts, which are the site of photosynthesis in plant cells. Chlorophyll is a complex molecule, composed of a porphyrin ring structure with a magnesium atom in the center. This structure allows chlorophyll to absorb specific wavelengths of light, mainly in the blue and red regions of the spectrum. There are several types of chlorophyll molecules, with chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b being the most common in plants. They differ slightly in their molecular structure, but both play crucial roles in the photosynthetic process. Other pigments exist in plants as well, such as carotenoids and anthocyanins, which assist in light harvesting and provide photoprotection during periods of excessive light exposure. These pigments are also complex molecules that contribute to the overall process of light absorption by plants. Considering the complexity of chlorophyll and other pigments involved in light absorption, it can be concluded that among the provided answer choices, \\"complex\\" is the most appropriate description for the molecules used by plants to absorb light energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Joe Carbrook's right-about-face was much more dramatic, for J.W. saw, when the decision was made, that Marty could not have been meant for anything but a preacher. It was as fit as you please. As to Joe, previous opinion had been pretty equally divided; one side leaning to the idea that he might make a lawyer, and the other predicting that he was more likely to be a perpetual and profitable client for some other lawyer.

Can we infer the following? The Titanic didn't have proper safety protocols in place","completion":"To address the inference that the Titanic didn't have proper safety protocols in place, it is important to take a closer look at the events leading up to the tragedy, the safety measures in place at the time, and the prevailing standards in maritime safety in the early 20th century. The RMS Titanic was considered the epitome of luxury and technological advancement in the early 1900s. It was outfitted with various safety features available at the time, such as watertight doors and compartments. At the time of its construction, many thought it to be virtually unsinkable. However, the sinking of the Titanic did highlight several deficiencies in safety protocols and practices, which subsequently led to significant changes in maritime safety regulations. Some issues identified include: 1. Insufficient lifeboats – The Titanic was equipped with 20 lifeboats, enough to accommodate just over 1,100 people, while there were more than 2,200 passengers and crew members aboard the ship. This deficit was partly due to outdated maritime laws that determined the number of lifeboats required on a ship based on its tonnage rather than its passenger capacity. Additionally, aesthetics and concerns about the deck appearing cluttered contributed to the lower number of lifeboats. 2. Inadequate crew training – The crew aboard the Titanic was not adequately trained in handling emergencies, such as the one faced that fateful night. Many crew members were unfamiliar with the lifeboat launching procedure, which led to delays and reduced capacity utilization of the available lifeboats. Moreover, many passengers were not informed of the proper safety procedures or the locations of life jackets and lifeboats. 3. Miscommunication and complacency – The Titanic received multiple ice warnings from other ships in the area before the collision but failed to take evasive action or reduce speed. Some messages were not forwarded to the bridge, while others did not result in an appropriate response. Complacency in the belief that the Titanic was \\"unsinkable\\" may also have played a role in the insufficient response to these warnings. 4. Compromised construction – While the Titanic's design included many advanced safety features for its time, such as watertight compartments designed to contain flooding, a few critical design flaws contributed to its vulnerability. For example, the watertight compartments were not entirely sealed at the top, which allowed water to spill over into adjacent compartments as the ship tilted. This flaw, combined with the significant damage to its hull from the iceberg impact, compromised the Titanic's ability to stay afloat. Taking these factors into consideration, we can infer that the Titanic did lack proper safety protocols by modern standards. However, it is crucial to understand that these shortcomings were not necessarily a result of negligence by the ship's designers or crew but rather a reflection of the prevailing safety standards and practices of the time. The disaster did serve as a catalyst for significant improvements in maritime safety. Following the sinking of the Titanic, the first International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) was adopted in 1914, which established standards for lifeboat capacity, crew training, and other ship safety protocols. These regulations have been continuously revisited and updated to this day, ensuring a commitment to learning from past tragedies and constantly improving maritime safety standards."},{"prompt":"Jesse lost every game and the others went home disappointed that they lost their bets.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: By the 2060s, robotics technology has advanced to the point that cybernetics have become plausible. World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research and development in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, the governing body, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage.In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructed a series of 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field that distorts the entire electromagnetic spectrum, nullifying all communication between Japan and the outside world and making even satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but for all intents and purposes, Japan vanishes from the world scene.Ten years later, the American Navy technology Special Forces unit \\"SWORD\\" is lead on the intel of a Japanese informant of a trap set by Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes, cut off his own leg to get rid of Vexille Serra, a soldier of SWORD. Analysis of the leg show that it is made of bio-metal. SWORD then begin to suspect that Japan has used the R.A.C.E network to conceal extensive development of banned technologies. They thus embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and determine the distortion frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather intelligence on the country.Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit the distortion frequency. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture or death, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters.Vexille awakens without her powered armor suit to find that Tokyo is now a shanty town ruled by Daiwa.

It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - \`\` Relentless '' is a song written by James LeBlanc and John Paul White and recorded by American country music artist Jason Aldean . It was released in May 2008 as the third and final single from his 2007 album of the same name .

It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins. - Broken Bow Records is an American independent record label based in Nashville, Tennessee.

Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Ferrier's association...

I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K.

They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work.

Article: In 1859, prefix = st1 /ItalyandFrancewere at war withAustria, and Henry Dunant, a young Swiss gentleman, came upon one of their battlefields. For the first time in his life, Dunant saw how heartless war would be. Around him were suffering men untended and left to die where they fell. Henry Dunant went to work at once. Helped by several peasant women, he formed an ambulance service and set up headquarters in a little church. He treated the wounds of Frenchmen, Italians and Austrians alike. When he was asked why he did so, his answer showed a spirit of humanity that was not common in those days. \\"We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer.\\" With his band of assistants, Dunant helped to save many lives. The \\"gentleman in white\\" (as Dunant was called because he wore a white suit) was looked upon by hundreds of wounded men as an angel. When Dunant returned toSwitzerland, he could not forget the needless suffering on the battlefield. He thought of a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. It would do its work with the approval of all countries. And it must operate under a sign that all would know: its symbol would be a red cross against a white background. He wrote a book to make the public see the need for this great organization. In the book he included a truthful account of what he had seen on the battlefield. The consequence was that readers were shocked by what he described. After Dunant's hard work, in Geneva on October 26, 1863, all the nations of Europe were invited to a meeting at which it was decided a relief society should be formed in each country. Then the Geneva Convention was made the following year. The nations that signed the Geneva Convention chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization. Until his death in 1910, Dunant was always ready to look for a noble cause. And when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time in 1901, the honor went to Dunant. No man has deserved it more than the founder of the Red Cross.

Possible A: talk to each other, learn from each other, demand justice, cook food, share food Why is \\"cook food\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Cook food\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons, which include the following: 1. Scope of the activity: When people have guests over at their homes, one of the primary activities usually conducted is socializing, and a significant portion of this involves sharing a meal. By cooking food, the host is able to provide their guests with a tangible way of connecting and bonding with each other. 2. Hospitality and sharing culture: It is part of human culture and tradition to show hospitality towards guests. This is often done by providing food and refreshments to the guests, which is seen as a universal sign of friendliness and care. Cooking food is an essential part of this, as it enables the host to cater to the guests' tastes and dietary requirements. 3. Social etiquette: Society has established norms and unwritten rules around hosting and attending social gatherings. One of the primary expectations during a social gathering is that guests should be treated with respect and be made comfortable. Cooking food is a common yet essential way of fulfilling these expectations, as it can signal to the guests that their presence is appreciated and valued. 4. Bonding and relationship-building: Cooking food and sharing a meal can forge stronger relationships, as this allows people to engage in conversations while enjoying a shared experience. Furthermore, cooking for someone else can be seen as an act of kindness and thoughtfulness, which can enhance the bond between the host and their guests. 5. Cultural and personal expression: Cooking food for guests can be a means for the host to express their cultural background or personal preferences through the dishes they prepare. This can lead to interesting discussions and learning experiences that enrich the overall gathering. 6. Nourishment and sustenance: Preparing food for guests fundamentally addresses the basic human need for sustenance and nourishment. Cooking food goes beyond the mere provision of calories; it allows for the guests and hosts to enjoy a pleasant, tasty, and comfortable experience. 7. Sensorial and holistic experience: A well-prepared and cooked meal can create a multisensory experience for guests, engaging their sense of taste, smell, sight, and touch. By creating a visually appealing and aromatic meal, hosts demonstrate their ability to create an enjoyable environment for their guests, elevating the overall experience of the social gathering. In conclusion, \\"cook food\\" is an answer that is aligned with human common sense primarily because it addresses several essential aspects of both human biology and sociocultural norms.

Write an article based on this summary: British film director Amma Asante says the organisers of the Oscars need to keep up the momentum on its actions to improve diversity. Article:","completion":"Title: Oscar Organisers: Ensuring Momentum for Sustainable Diversity in the Film Industry In recent years, the Oscars have come under fire for their lack of representation and diversity amongst nominees and winners, leading to movements such as #Oscarssowhite. In response, the organisers of the Oscars have taken several measures to improve diversity within the Academy and in the film industry as a whole. British film director Amma Asante, the creative genius behind critically acclaimed films like \\"Belle\\" and \\"A United Kingdom,\\" has some important words for the Oscars' organisers: keep up the momentum. Asante herself has made history as an African British film director and woman of colour, ensuring her films are ardent reflections of the people and stories often underrepresented in mainstream movies. In recent years, we have started seeing an improvement in the Oscars' diversity as more people of colour have been nominated and awarded the prestigious Gold. However, Asante believes that these are only the starting points for significant, lasting changes in the film industry. She argues that the Oscars should maintain and capitalise on the momentum they have gained, ensuring diversity is not just a temporary trend, but a permanent fixture in the world of cinema. Asante suggests that the organisers of the prestigious awards focus on three main areas to ensure sustained and meaningful diversity in the film industry. 1. Encourage and support emerging diverse talent Firstly, the Oscars need to engage with and support new and emerging creators from diverse ethnicities, genders, and backgrounds. By giving these individuals access to specialised training and financial resources, the Academy can better equip them to break into the highly competitive film industry. This will create an inclusive and diverse creative environment that will ultimately broaden the stories told on the silver screen. 2. Amplify underrepresented voices One of the most powerful ways of achieving more diversity in the film industry is by giving a platform to tell diverse stories. By supporting underrepresented voices, the Oscars can demonstrate their commitment to telling stories that resonate across different cultures and communities and foster an industry that accurately reflects society's diversity. 3. Tackle systemic bias in the industry Lastly, Asante argues that the Oscars need to tackle systemic bias within the industry. This may include addressing unfair casting practices and gender pay gaps, revealing hidden biases in film funding, or providing more opportunities for marginalised filmmakers to succeed. The Academy has already taken steps toward achieving greater diversity at the Oscars, such as changing membership rules to invite more diverse voters and introducing guidelines to promote more diverse representation in nominated films. However, it is vital to ensure that these changes do not lose steam over time. Only by continually pushing for change can the Oscars organisers create a film industry that tells stories for everyone, showcasing the full range of human experiences, cultures, and artistic talents. In conclusion, British film director Amma Asante is urging the Oscars organisers to keep up the momentum on their actions to improve diversity in the film industry. By focusing on encouraging emerging talents, amplifying underrepresented voices, and tackling systemic bias, the Oscars can help pave the way for lasting positive change and create a more inclusive, vibrant, and reflective film industry for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With which instrument is jazz musician Earl Hines principally associated?","completion":"Earl Hines, an American jazz musician, is principally associated with the piano. Born on December 28, 1903, in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, Earl “Fatha” Hines emerged as one of the most innovative and influential pianists in the history of jazz. Earl Hines began his musical journey at an early age, learning to play the piano, trumpet, and other instruments from his father, who was also a musician. However, it was his exceptional talent for the piano that helped him stand out. In his late teens, Hines relocated to Pittsburgh to join Lois Deppe's orchestra at the Liederhaus. Deppe, recognizing the potential in Hines, provided him with further opportunities that allowed his talent to flourish. In 1923, Hines moved to Chicago, where he became a fixture in the local jazz scene. In Chicago, Hines joined various groups and orchestras, including bands led by Erskine Tate, Carroll Dickerson, and Louis Armstrong, the latter being a significant influence on Hines' career. As a pianist, Hines rejected the then-dominant stride piano technique, which was popular among musicians like James P. Johnson and Fats Waller. Instead, he revolutionized piano playing by introducing a rhythmic and melodic approach that became a key characteristic of his unique style. Hines' playing, notable for its virtuosic speed, rhythmic improvisation, and technical dexterity, mirrored the melodic phrasings of horn lines, closely resembling a member of a horn section \\"comping\\" behind a soloist. As a result, soloists anchored their improvisations on Hines' rhythm and harmony, forging a robust partnership between Hines and the soloists. In 1928, Hines formed his big band, Earl Hines and His Orchestra, which went on to become part of the emerging swing movement and featured some legendary musicians, such as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Sarah Vaughan. His orchestra recorded numerous hit songs, including \\"Deep Forest,\\" \\"Piano Man,\\" \\"Rosetta,\\" and \\"Boogie Woogie on St. Louis Blues,\\" showcasing Hines' captivating piano work and advanced harmonic skills. Earl Hines' style greatly influenced future generations of pianists, including Oscar Peterson, Art Tatum, Thelonious Monk, and even Horace Silver. Throughout his career, which spanned over five decades, Hines never stopped refining and experimenting with his piano style, resulting in a rich legacy that solidified his status as a jazz piano virtuoso. In conclusion, Earl \\"Fatha\\" Hines, a pioneering jazz musician, is primarily associated with the piano. His innovative and distinctive playing style revolutionized the way pianists approached their instrument, laying the foundation for modern jazz piano and influencing numerous artists of his time as well as future generations of jazz musicians."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Information: - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society. - A tank is an armored fighting vehicle designed for front-line combat, with heavy firepower, strong armour, and tracks providing good battlefield manoeuvrability. The first tanks were designed to overcome the deadlock of trench warfare; now they are a mainstay of modern ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat. - The Panzer II is the common name used for a family of German tanks used in World War II. The official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen II ( abbreviated PzKpfw II ) . Although the vehicle had originally been designed as a stopgap while larger , more advanced tanks were developed , it nonetheless went on to play an important role in the early years of World War II , during the Polish and French campaigns . The Panzer II was the most numerous tank in the German Panzer divisions beginning with the invasion of France . It was used in both North Africa against the British and on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union . The Panzer II was supplanted by the Panzer III and IV by 1940/1941 . Thereafter , it was used to great effect as a reconnaissance tank . By the end of 1942 , it had been largely removed from front line service and it was used for training and on secondary fronts . The turrets of the then obsolete PzKpfw Is and PzKpfw IIs were reused as gun turrets on specially built defensive bunkers , particularly on the Atlantic Wall . Production of the tank itself ceased by 1943 , but its chassis remained in use as the basis of several other armored vehicles , chiefly self - propelled artillery and tank destroyers such as the Wespe and Marder II. - Firepower is the military capability to direct force at an enemy. (It is not to be confused with the concept of \\"rate of fire\\", which describes cycling of the firing mechanism in a weapon system.) Firepower involves the whole range of potential weapons. The concept is generally taught as one of the three key principles of modern warfare wherein the enemy forces are destroyed or have their will to fight negated by sufficient and preferably overwhelming use of force as a result of combat operations. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. - A battle is a combat in warfare between two or more armed forces, or combatants. A war sometimes consists of many battles. Battles generally are well defined in duration, area, and force commitment. - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known. - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\" - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Germany in the 1930s. The name is short for the German (\\"armored fighting vehicle mark I\\"), abbreviated \\"\\". The tank's official German ordnance inventory designation was SdKfz 101 (\\"special purpose vehicle 101\\"). - Combined arms is an approach to warfare which seeks to integrate different combat arms of a military to achieve mutually complementary effects (for example, using infantry and armor in an urban environment, where one supports the other, or both support each other). According to strategist William S. Lind, combined arms can be distinguished from the concept of \\"supporting arms\\" as follows: Combined arms hits the enemy with two or more arms simultaneously in such a manner that the actions he must take to defend himself from one make him more vulnerable to another. In contrast, supporting arms is hitting the enemy with two or more arms in sequence, or if simultaneously, then in such combination that the actions the enemy must take to defend himself from one also defends himself from the other(s). - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict. - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: When you think you’ve found the right area for your hostel, check local laws before you do anything else. Some towns and cities have designated zones for hostels, and running one outside these areas is illegal. Find out where hostels are allowed, then search for a suitable building within these areas. Many local governments have their zoning laws on the internet. Try searching the local government website for hostel information. Contact the local zoning agency and ask about which areas are zoned for hostels. Most cities require permits and licenses to run a hostel. Check with your local zoning board or chamber of commerce and ask what regulations there are for operating a hostel. Apply for and obtain all the permits before opening your hostel. Remember that permits often take time to process and cost a fee. Include the potential processing time and fees in your calculations on when the hostel will open. Don't try to save time or money by skipping certain permits. If you operate a hostel without all the necessary permits, you could be fined or even arrested. Operating costs are what it costs to keep a business running every day. Account for every dollar you will spend in opening this hostel so you know how much financing to secure. Calculate the rent, utilities, and any other expenses so you have a full picture of your business finances. Remember to include taxes in your estimation of costs. Include the outlay for construction, permits, and hiring employees as well. This gives you your total cost for the project. Have at least 1 year of expenses on hand before opening the hostel to support the business before you start profiting. If you don’t have enough savings to self-finance opening and operating the hostel, then you’ll need funding from other sources. Consider going to a bank for a business loan. Another option is finding affluent people interested in providing private investment for the hostel. Whichever option you choose, have financing in place before you start building your hostel. There are advantages and disadvantages to looking for loans from banks or individuals. Banks may be more conservative and refuse to loan you more than a fixed amount. Private investors may be more willing to offer higher sums, but they want a return on their investment. They might want to own a part of the business and share in the profits. Consider the costs carefully before choosing a financing option. Produce a good business plan, especially if you’re looking for private financing. Investors will want a return on their investment, and if you don’t prove that your business will be profitable, they won’t provide financing.","completion":"In order to establish a successful hostel, it is important to first research and understand the local laws and zoning regulations. Some cities have specific areas designated for hostels, and operating outside of these zones could result in fines or legal consequences. One can find this information on local government websites or by contacting the local zoning agency. It is crucial to obtain all necessary permits and licenses before opening, as non-compliance can have serious repercussions. Make sure to account for processing time and fees associated with these permits when planning the hostel's opening timeline. In order to accurately calculate the costs of opening and running a hostel, it is important to consider every expense, including rent, utilities, construction, permits, employee salaries, taxes, and any other potential costs. It is advised to have at least one year's worth of expenses on hand before opening to ensure the business can survive until it begins generating profit. If personal savings are insufficient to finance the opening and operation of the hostel, alternative funding solutions, such as bank loans or private investments, can be considered. Banks tend to offer more conservative loans, while private investors may offer higher amounts but may request a share in the profits or partial ownership of the business. It is important to weigh the pros and cons of each financing method before making a decision. Finally, developing a comprehensive business plan is essential for securing funding, particularly from private investors who want to ensure they will receive a return on their investment. A strong business plan should outline the profitability and growth projections of the hostel, demonstrating its potential for success and solidifying the confidence of potential investors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Next, to solve for 'a', we have to isolate 'a' on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract the constant term (1032) from both sides of the equation: 43*a = -1032. Finally, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient 43 to find the value of 'a': a = -1032 / 43. When you carry out the division, you find that a = -24.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: If you'd like to spend the perfect day with your lover, consider marking the occasion by putting on a little perfume, cologne, or aftershave — especially if you don't normally do so. A small sprinkling of an enticing scent can make a subtle (but noticeable) difference that your partner will most likely appreciate. Be sure to brace yourself — studies have shown that scent plays an important role in sexual attraction! To wear perfume or cologne, spray a tiny amount on your wrists, and perhaps dab a touch behind your ears. Other places, especially those where the blood vessels are thickest, like behind your knees and elbows, can also benefit from a gentle spray. Just be careful that it's you who's wearing the fragrance (and not the fragrance who's wearing you). Note that many deodorants, especially those for men, already have a strong scent or perfume in them. In this case, avoid adding an additional perfume on top of the first. Wearing multiple scents can cause \\"clashing\\", overpowering results that aren't usually very flattering. Try making a jaunt over to your local cafe or ice cream shop for a sweet time! You don't even have to have a meal beforehand — in the words of Ally Craig in Remember Me: \\"I just don't see the point in waiting. I mean, what if I die while eating my entrée?\\". Indulging in treats you wouldn't normally enjoy together is a great way to mark this special occasion. It's also quite fitting — today, your whole day is a \\"dessert\\" for you and your partner to enjoy. Enjoy the day's freedom by going somewhere you've never been before. This can be someplace as simple as a trail in your local park or someplace as exciting as the wide-open wilderness — with the right attitude, both can offer great opportunities for exploration. The sounds of birds, the sight of the light filtering through the trees, and the fresh smell of nature will improve your mood right away and give you an opportunity to have a relaxing, heartfelt conversation. Plus, walking is proven form of stimulating, mood-lifting exercise you both get to share together! If you live in the city or somewhere without any wilderness nearby, you can still explore — just take a walk around your neighborhood. Greet the people you meet with a smile, or just keep yourselves — it's up to you. Going to an orchard (or just out into the wilderness) to pick fruit is highly underrated — it's cheaper, fresher and much more fun than buying berries from the store (not to mention the fact that you get to snack as you go). Best of all, this makes a highly enjoyable couples activity — for instance, you can compete to see who can collect more fruit or pool your resources together to make a pie! Depending on where you live and what time of the year it is, different fruits will be available for picking. Try consulting with a botanical resource to figure out what's ripe — apples, for instance, can be bought at the supermarket all year, but only get ripe in the fall. A word of caution — some plants you may find in the wilderness may be poisonous, so if you're ever less than 100% sure about something you've found, don't eat it. For example, nightshade berries, which are small, black, and shiny, may look appetizing, but they can actually be deadly in sufficient quantities. If you haven't done so before, try exploring your artistic side with your partner! Drawing, painting, writing a song, and even making your own short film can be mind-expanding ways to spend your afternoon. You may even discover things about your partner that you weren't aware of as part of the artistic process — your girlfriend, for instance, may have an eye for expressive camera angles to rival Stanley Kubrick's. Even if the finished product isn't exactly what you had in mind, you'll have an imperfect work of art you can laugh about in the future, so get your creative juices flowing! If you haven't ever gone to a spa with your partner before, consider visiting one as part of your \\"lovely day,\\" even if it's not something you'd normally do. Getting a relaxing massage or spending some time in the sauna can leave you feeling completely refreshed and rejuvenated, especially if you've recently been stressed out. Even the manliest of men are allowed at spas, so don't be afraid if you've never been before! You don't have to make an appointment at an expensive spa to have a good time. If you're short on cash, try making your own personal spa date at home. Run a deep, warm bath for two and wash yourself with the best soap you have handy before moisturizing your whole body with a good body lotion. Light a few candles is to make things even more romantic! . Diving into the bargain bins at a local thrift shop with your partner can be an entertaining experience. You won't always find something great (and sometimes you'll find something horrendous), but occasionally, you'll come across some truly stylish vintage clothing. Treasure hunting in vintage shops can be a lot of fun if you're open to it — you won't know what's out there in your size until you go hunt for it! The benefits of shopping for vintage clothes are many: for example, you don't ever have to worry about whether or not your friends have bought the same piece of clothing as you — odds are, you have the only copy of your shirt in town! The shopping process itself is also a lot more fun and engaging than going to the mall and simply buying expensive new clothes. If you have time, try to be somewhere that you'll have a clear view of the setting sun in the evening with your partner. Sometimes, it's a lovely experience to just sit quietly in each others' arms and watch the sun go down. This can be an exceptionally intimate experience if you've had a hustling, bustling day full of activities. It's often unusual to get the chance to be completely silent for a few minutes, so make the most of it! You can usually find the exact time that the sun will go down in your area online with a simple search engine query. Usually, the absolute most you'll need to do is input your location and the date for which you'd like to know the sunset time. End your day by going out and enjoying each others' company on the dance floor! The type of music you dance to is up to you and your partner — it doesn't matter whether it's ballroom waltzes or heavy metal as long as you love it! It may be easiest to do your dancing in the company of other people in a club or dancehall, but if you're really bold, you can do it in a park, on the street corner, or in your backyard. You can even do it by candlelight in your own house if you want to set a romantic mood. You never need to worry about how you look while dancing with your partner! Just close your eyes, feel the music, and move. Remember, you're doing this for each others' attention — not the attention of the people around you. If you're shy about dancing, don't worry! Many dance halls have \\"beginner's nights\\" or dance classes to teach you the basics so that you can enjoy yourself when it counts! You can even take dance classes at many gyms and Universities, so take a look online for opportunities near you!","completion":"This article is about having a perfect day with your loved one and suggests some fun activities to do together.

Maria's goals were much steadier than Monica's because","completion":"Maria's goals were much steadier than Monica's because they were built on a foundation of consistency, discipline, and long-term vision. These qualities allowed Maria to steadily progress toward her goals, whereas Monica's goals seemed to shift and change as easily as the wind. Firstly, Maria's consistency in setting achievable targets was one of the primary factors for her steady goals. Maria was very meticulous in her planning methodology, as she clearly defined her objectives from the beginning. This enabled her to allocate time and effort towards her plan efficiently, making it easier for her to track her progress and identify any potential adjustments. In contrast, Monica struggled to maintain a clear vision of what she wanted, with her goals changing every few weeks or sometimes even shorter. With a lack of consistency, she had to constantly revise and revamp her plans which in turn, compromised her ability to achieve her goals in a timely manner. Secondly, Maria's disciplined nature played a significant part in her progress. This character trait allowed her to establish an organized daily routine focused on working towards her long-term objectives. Even when life got busy or various distractions sought to knock her off course, Maria's discipline and focus to stick to her routine consistently guided her towards her goals. Monica, on the other hand, could not maintain this discipline or organization. Her inconsistency in following routines led to inefficiency, floundering, and eventually, abandonment of her plans altogether. Besides consistency and discipline, Maria also had a clear long-term vision for herself. She was aware of where she wanted to be in her personal and professional life in the years to come. This foresight allowed her to map out her path and diligently work towards it. She not only planned but routinely analyzed her progress, taking note of any change in her circumstances. This close attention to detail helped her make the necessary adjustments to her objectives and the respective approaches. Conversely, Monica's short-term thinking and impulsive nature thwarted her from establishing a steady, forward-looking plan. Her lack of long-term vision impaired her decision-making and led her to make hasty decisions that brought her short-lived satisfaction rather than long-term success. Maria's consistent, disciplined, and forward-thinking approach served as strong pillars in achieving her goals, while also helping her adapt to any changes in her environment. Her constant reflection on her progress and commitment to her plans enabled her to stay on course and avoid getting entangled in unrealistic ambitions or impulsive actions. In contrast, Monica's fluctuating goals and priorities, as well as her struggle with discipline and long-term vision, limited her ability to make steady progress towards a fulfilling and rewarding future. Overall, the difference between Maria and Monica's approach to goal setting and achieving can serve as valuable insight for anyone striving to make significant progress in their own lives. Cultivating consistency, discipline, and long-term vision, as demonstrated by Maria, can certainly improve one's chances of achieving success, ultimately leading to a more enriching and purposeful life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Background: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. Paragraph: Tree city and Leaf city were the two biggest cities in Boulderland.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was conducted by Henry Wood when it was played at a London Promenade Concert?, using the article: Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, \\"Four or five years ago if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full from floor to ceiling for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The piece conducted by Henry Wood when it was played at a London Promenade Concert was the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches composed by Edward Elgar between 1901 and 1930.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. For men, tuck a collared dress shirt into a pair of straight-leg or slim-fit slacks. Add a tie that complements the colors of your shirt and pants if the occasion calls for it. For women, dresses and skirts are more formal. Wear a shift dress or a pencil skirt that hits mid-thigh or lower. Avoid showing too much skin if you’re attending a nicer event like a theater performance or fancy dinner. If you're a woman who wants to wear pants, choose dress slacks that are flattering and hemmed to the right length. A properly fitting dress shirt should have a collar that fits snugly around your neck, sleeves that hit just above your hands, and shoulder seams that line up with the ends of your shoulders. Materials like silk, satin, or velvet are all more formal. Avoid clothing that looks cheap or flimsy, or that has sloppy stitching or frays. A cashmere sweater paired with wool pants is a good option for men and women. Women might wear a velvet skirt with a blouse or a silk midi dress. Men could wear khakis and a tailored shirt paired with a satin tie. Embellishments like gems, pearls, or ruffles also add visual interest to your outfit. What you wear on top of your outfit is just as important as the outfit itself. After all, it’s what people see first. If it’s cold outside or if you simply want to add a layer, slip on a fitted blazer or sport coat. It looks professional when worn over a flirty dress for women and smartens up a dress shirt for men. Get your blazer or sport coat tailored before wearing it so it fits properly. A blazer that’s too baggy or has sleeves that are too long just looks sloppy. Choose a pair that’s around 3 inches (7.6 cm) high or lower to avoid looking trashy and to protect your feet. There are plenty of styles to pick from like stilettos, platforms, pumps, and kitten heels. Make sure you can walk in the shoes you choose to wear. Nothing kills an outfit faster than a woman limping around in 6 in (15 cm) stilettos. Your heel height should be based on what you’re wearing, too. A long dress may require a certain heel height so it doesn’t drag on the ground. If you’re wearing a mini dress, choose a lower height. Shiny lace-up derbies pair well with suits for more formal events. Suede bucks or neutral leather Oxfords are still classy but can be worn with trousers or wool pants. Match your shoes to the color scheme of your outfit. Avoid clashing hues like black with navy or black with brown, for example. If you’re wearing dress shoes, shine them first. Polish your shoes yourself or take them to a shoe repair store or kiosk in the mall to have it done. If you’re going to wear jewelry, stay away from gaudy costume pieces. Instead, opt for elegant accessories like a diamond-studded watch for men or a dainty gold chain with an emerald drop for women. A little goes a long way with quality jewelry so stick to 1 to 2 statement pieces. Charm bracelets, diamond stud earrings, pretty choker necklaces, and delicate jeweled rings are all chic options. Choose jewelry based on your neckline. For example, a high-collared top calls for bigger earrings and no necklaces whereas a low v-neck looks good with a long pendant. Pick a small handheld purse that matches your shoes or your jewelry. For example, if you’re wearing silver jewelry, take a silver or cool-toned clutch or wristlet. Choose one in a fancier fabric like silk or one that’s beaded and embellished. Stock your clutch with anything you might need like lipstick, extra bobby pins, and your wallet.","completion":"Dress nicely with fitted clothes, appropriate shoes, and elegant accessories for a formal look, and make sure to adjust your outfit based on the occasion and your comfort."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Can you tell I am not a fan? My guy and I went here last night around 7pm.. We were told that there was a 40 minute wait..I walked around the restaurant and it was about 1/4 full.. It is a huge place , and there was about 10 tables with customers, the rest were empty, clean, and waiting for someone to sit in. Seriously, why am I waiting 40 minutes ? 40 minutes come and go and we come back , now there is about 2 parties in the dining room and we are still waiting to be sat, finally I give the hostess an evil glare and we are sat. Right next to the kitchen. there is about 50 empty tables and we are sitting right next to the kitchen ?! really? So then we sit , and sit, and sit.. My boyfriend says we will give them 5 more minutes and then we will leave. 4 minutes in and our waiter shows up looking like he has been working his butt off , I look around wondering why he looks so overwhelmed, There are a dozen servers and now about 5 tables being occupied.. This guy is a mess, he can't look us in the eye, takes out drink orders and runs off without taking our food orders..Which we obviously were ready to give seeing how we sat there for 15 minutes before a server even approached our table. He then scurries around randomly , we just watch him..another 8 minutes go by and we see him walk in our direction stop , look at us, realization that he never gave us our beers dawns on his face and he runs back towards the bar. This pretty much goes on like this all night. It took us about 45 minutes to get out check at the end. Now , my guy and I have both been servers, so we always tip 20% ... it pained me to even tip him at all. He did nothing . other people brought us our food and cleared our dishes..he never checked on us,never refilled our drinks, never asked if we wanted another beer, or even dessert..which I was dying to try the bananas.. but couldn't even order them because he NEVER came back. WTF. Just looked at my receipt..The server is named Ruben .. The food was complete garbage. 10 for a tiny bowl of mediocre guacamole with NO chips !

Ian has never read a blog, and Kyle reads them every day, so","completion":"the two friends often have contrasting opinions on various topics. While Ian tends to gather his information from traditional media sources such as newspapers, magazines, and television, Kyle relies heavily on his favorite blogs for in-depth analysis, personal perspectives, and cutting-edge insights on the latest trends and issues. Their conversations are a fascinating blend of the old and the new, revealing how the digital age has reshaped the way people collect, process, and share information. Ian, a purist at heart, appreciates the time-honored credibility and professionalism of the more traditional media outlets. He enjoys the tactile experience of holding a newspaper or a magazine, appreciating the smell of the ink and the feel of the paper between his fingers. To Ian, being well-informed means diving deep into thoroughly researched and fact-checked articles, editorials, and opinion pieces that have undergone rigorous editorial reviews.

He took two objects, object A and object B, to his physics professor. Object A had higher temperature, but object B had lower temperature. His physics professor explained him why one object's temperature was higher while other object's temperature was lower. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would particles move slower or faster in object A than in object B? Answer:","completion":"Particles would move faster in object A than in object B. The difference in particle movement is due to the difference in the temperature of the two objects. To better understand the concept of temperature and its relationship to particle movement, let us explore the science behind it. Temperature is fundamentally a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Kinetic energy, in turn, is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. In the context of temperature, this motion refers to the vibration, rotation, and translation of individual particles (such as atoms and molecules) within the substance. When an object is heated, its particles gain energy, causing them to move faster and more vigorously. Consequently, the temperature of the object increases. In contrast, cooling an object involves the removal of heat, which results in a decrease in the kinetic energy of its particles. As the particles lose energy, their motion becomes slower and less intense, and the object's temperature decreases. From the information given in the paragraph, we know that object A has a higher temperature than object B. This higher temperature indicates that the particles in object A possess greater average kinetic energy when compared to those in object B. Therefore, the particles in object A move faster and with more energy than their counterparts in object B. It is important to note that temperature can be influenced by factors such as external heat sources, the material of the object, and the ambient environment, among others. The exchange of heat between objects can also lead to changes in temperature, for example through processes such as conduction, convection, and radiation. In conclusion, particles in object A, with its higher temperature, would move faster than particles in object B, which has a lower temperature. This difference in particle velocity is a result of the differing kinetic energies conferred by the varying temperatures of the two objects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mit der Unterzeichnung der Römischen Verträge im März 1957 wurde die Europäische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft gegründet (EWG): der gemeinsame Markt umfasst die 6 Länder Belgien, die Niederlande, Luxemburg, Frankreich, Deutschland und Italien. Translate to English","completion":"With the signing of the Treaty of Rome in March 1957, the European Economic Community (EEC) was founded: the common market comprises the 6 countries Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, and Italy. The Treaty of Rome, signed by representatives of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, and Italy, essentially marked the birth of the European Economic Community (EEC), which later evolved into the European Union (EU) that exists today. The treaty aimed to create a unified economic community that would promote the economic development of its member states, enhance trade relations, and eventually reduce barriers to the free movement of goods, services, capital and labor. The six founding countries, often referred to as the \\"Inner Six,\\" had already begun working together to develop a multilateral cooperation in the aftermath of World War II as a means to rebuild their economies and strengthen relations among them. The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), established in 1951, was an early example of this cooperation, laying the foundation for the creation of the EEC. The EEC's main focus was to establish a single market that would promote economic growth and development by facilitating the free movement of goods and services, allowing the member countries to benefit from economies of scale, increased competition and improved innovation. To accomplish this, the treaty outlined a series of measures that would gradually eliminate customs duties, harmonize trade policies and regulations, and establish common institutions to address economic and social concerns. One key aspect of the EEC was the establishment of common policies in areas such as agriculture, transport and trade. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), for example, aimed to ensure a steady supply of food at stable prices while also providing a decent standard of living for farmers. The transport policy was established to connect the member countries and ensure the free flow of goods, while the common trade policy facilitated access to external markets through uniform negotiation. Moreover, the treaty also laid the groundwork for the freedom of movement of persons, services, and capital within the EEC. The aim was to encourage worker mobility and create a dynamic labor market where the member states' workforce could move easily to regions with better economic opportunities. In addition to these core principles, the treaty also emphasized the importance of maintaining a high level of social and economic cohesion within the community. This included provisions for a Social Fund to support the development of economically disadvantaged regions and a European Investment Bank (EIB) to finance large-scale infrastructure projects that would bring long-term benefits to the community. Over time, the EEC expanded its membership and evolved into the European Union, building on the foundations set by the Treaty of Rome. Today, the EU has 27 member countries (following the United Kingdom's exit in 2020) and continues to promote economic cooperation, peaceful relations, and the harmonization of laws and standards among its members. In summary, the signing of the Treaty of Rome in March 1957 marked the establishment of the European Economic Community, initially composed of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, and Italy. The EEC was created as a vehicle to promote economic growth, enhance trade relations, reduce barriers, and strengthen the foundations for the future European Union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we conclude that \\"Billy is so short.\\" if the statement \\"John couldn't see the stage with Billy in front of him because he is so short.\\" is true?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Billy is so short\\" from the given statement. The reasons are as follows: 1. Understanding the Statement: The statement says \\"John couldn't see the stage with Billy in front of him because he is so short.\\" This means that John's view to the stage was obstructed by Billy, and the reason was due to someone being short. 2. Identifying Ambiguity: The statement doesn't specify who \\"he\\" is in \\"he is so short.\\" It could refer to Billy or John. English grammar typically would associate \\"he\\" with the most recently mentioned male, which would be Billy. However, the practical consequence of the situation, (John can't see past Billy) is because John is short, not Billy. 3. Final Analysis: Therefore, from the statement, we can only infer either John is so short that he couldn't see the stage with Billy in front of him, or Billy is so tall that John couldn't see the stage past him. We do not have enough information to conclusively state that Billy is short. Thus, it is crucial to remember that careful interpretation is necessary when pronouns are used and several individuals are being referred to in the same context, as it may lead to ambiguity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: A committee will look at the government's welfare changes and unemployment policies to see if they \\"disproportionately affect\\" the rights of disadvantaged and vulnerable people. The review, part of a regular cycle of examinations, will be the first undertaken since 2009. The findings will be published next June. As part of the examination of government policies, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has requested further information on more than 30 issues. The committee will examine whether measures have targeted certain groups such as disabled people, ethnic minorities or those on low incomes. A UN spokeswoman said the CESCR would review the UK and six other countries. \\"It is not an investigation or inquiry launched in response to a particular situation or at the request of a third party,\\" she added. The review is being carried out because the UK signed up to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Areas under examination will include: Earlier this month members of the Just Fair coalition, which campaigns for \\"social justice in the UK\\", met CESCR representatives. Just Fair members said they were concerned government policies had \\"led to violations of the right to food, housing, adequate healthcare for migrants and people with mental health problems and the economic and social rights of disabled people\\". Just Fair chairman Jamie Burton said the UN review was \\"timely and welcome\\". \\"We and many others are concerned about the adverse impact austerity policies have had on the least well off and already marginalised in society, including those in work,\\" he said. \\"In the one of the richest countries in the world people do not have enough food to eat or decent housing to live in. \\"Worst of all, the measures have hit children, single mothers and people with disabilities the hardest. As the tax credits scandal shows, the public is turning against these policies precisely because they are so unfair.\\" The government is aiming to cut annual welfare spending by Â£12bn, in line with a Conservative manifesto pledge. A government spokesman said: \\"This is not an investigation but a routine request for information that occurs every few years as part of the periodic reporting process to the UN. \\"We are committed to protecting the most vulnerable in society. The UK government continues to support millions of people on benefits with an Â£80bn working-age welfare safety net in place.\\" The UN review is separate from an ongoing investigation by the UN's Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is looking at whether the government's disability benefit reforms breached the rights of disabled people.","completion":"So imagine there is a very important group of people, like school teachers, who want to make sure that everyone is treated right. They are going to look at some of the changes that our leaders, like a principal of a school, have made to help people who don't have jobs or are having a hard time. This group wants to make sure these changes are fair and don't hurt people who are already having a tough time, like those with disabilities or those with not enough money. This is like when your teacher is making sure no one in class is being treated badly. They checked this last time about 12 years ago, and will tell everyone what they find next summer.

Some people, like the members in a club called Just Fair, are worried these changes are making it harder for people to get things they need, like food and a place to live. That's not nice, right? Some people think this check is good and needed. Even though our leaders are trying to spend less money on helping people, they said this is not because they're being mean but they are asked to share information, and they are committed to protecting people who need help the most.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"A brown dog playing in mud.\\" if \\"A white dog emerges clean from her bath.\\"?","completion":"Based on the given information, it is not possible to directly conclude that \\"A brown dog is playing in mud\\" when we only know that \\"A white dog emerges clean from her bath.\\" These two statements appear unrelated at first glance, and to draw a conclusion that connects the two would require additional information and context. Nevertheless, we can consider different scenarios that might connect these sentences. If we were to hypothesize upon these two scenarios, we could do so from different angles, such as the following: 1. Spatial and temporal relationship: If both the white dog and the brown dog are in the same place, such as a park, and observed simultaneously, the two dogs could be engaged in different activities. In this case, we could infer that while the white dog is enjoying her clean bath, the brown dog is playing in the mud. 2. Contrasting behaviors: The two dogs may belong to the same owner or might be part of a story where the author wants to emphasize the contrasting behaviors of the dogs. Thus, while the white dog is careful and clean during her bath, the brown dog shows playful tendencies and gets dirty in the mud. 3. Consequence or cause: One statement could be a cause or consequence of the other. For example, perhaps the owner of the white dog had just finished cleaning her because she was also playing in the mud like the brown dog. This could lead to a comparison between the two dogs, which might demonstrate the need for a bath after rolling around in the mud or be used to describe how different dogs interact with their environment. Even though the above scenarios consider potential connections between the two statements, none of the explanations conclusively prove that \\"A brown dog is playing in mud\\" if \\"A white dog emerges clean from her bath\\" without more context or additional information. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that one statement directly implies the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer is:","completion":"I've been using an application with the package net.androgames.level for several weeks now and must say it has not quite lived up to my expectations, leading me to give it a rating of two stars out of five. At first glance, the app's concept seemed to be very compelling and exactly what I had in mind when I downloaded it. The user interface was neat, crisp, and professional - which looked promising and reassured me about my decision to try this app. The application seemed simple to use and had some nice graphics, making it visually appealing right from the start. However, once I immersed myself in the application and its functions, the first issues started to arise. The main problem was its poor performance. I frequently experienced crashes, and on some occasions, the app would freeze. This had a significant impact on the overall user experience. Furthermore, despite my device's high performance, the app demonstrated a worrying level of slowness that rendered many of its functions almost unusable. Loading times were lengthy which, in my experience, is not a common occurrence on my device. This indicates to me that the issue lies with the app itself rather than my device. In terms of functionality, it was not on par with the description and the reviews I had read beforehand. I encountered numerous bugs, such as inaccurate positioning, misinterpretation of the angle, and incorrect measurements. This could lead to problems if people were to use it for accurate measurements that they would be using for work or home improvement projects. Moreover, despite the professional look of the app, the user interface was not as intuitive as I hoped. Navigation was convoluted, and menus were not readily accessible. I found myself spending an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out how certain functionalities work. Furthermore, ads were invasive, popping up too often, disrupting the user experience, and sometimes even causing the app to crash. A clear compromise on user experience to serve ads is not optimal and comes off as a desperate revenue-raising model. The customer service was also somewhat lackluster. I reached out for support regarding the issues I was facing, but their responses were delayed and not very helpful. All in all, for an app of this kind, I was highly disappointed. The issues I've faced, when weighed against the good points, significantly overshadow its potential. In its current state, the app just presents too many obstacles to provide the seamless, user-friendly experience one would expect. It needs many improvements, and until they are addressed, I can't rate it higher than two stars. The design, while arguably presentable, cannot redeem the functional flaws embodied in the application.

The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.

Travis are a Scottish rock band formed in Glasgow in 1990, composed of Fran Healy (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Dougie Payne (bass guitar, backing vocals), Andy Dunlop (lead guitar, banjo, backing vocals) and Neil Primrose (drums, percussion). The band's name comes from the Harry Dean Stanton character Travis Henderson from the film Paris, Texas. The band is widely claimed by the media as having paved the way for other bands such as Keane and Coldplay to go onto achieve worldwide success throughout the 2000s, particularly through the band's The Man Who (1999) album. The band released their debut album, Good Feeling (1997) to moderate success where it debuted at number nine on the UK Albums Chart and went onto achieve a silver certification from the BPI in January 2000. In 2002, however, things came to a halt for Travis, with the band almost calling it quits, after drummer Neil Primrose went head-first into a shallow swimming pool while on tour in France, just after a concert at Eurockeennes festival. Breaking his neck, he almost died due to spinal damage. If not for his road crew, he also would have drowned. Despite the severity of the accident, Primrose has since made a full recovery. With Primrose having recovered, Travis regrouped and re-evaluated. Moving into a cottage in Crear, Argyll and Bute, they set up a small studio, and over two weeks, came up with nine new songs that would form the basis of their fourth studio album, 2003's 12 Memories. Produced by Travis themselves, Tchad Blake, and Steve Orchard, the album marked a move into more organic, moody and political territory for the band. Although this seems to have alienated some fans, the album generally received very positive reviews (for example, \\"Then, of course, there's Travis and their album 12 Memories [Epic]. You just have to sit there and listen to it all the way through, and it will take you on a real journey. It's like an old album. It's like the Beatles' Revolver [1966]. Fran Healy's voice and lyrics are mesmerizing and beautiful\\"--Elton John), singles such as \\"Re-Offender\\" did very well on the UK chart, and the album itself reached No. 3. Yet it also saw them lose ground in the U.S., where Coldplay had usurped Travis during their 2002 absence. Much later, Fran Healy spoke about the album as a whole being about him working through his own clinical depression, and the 12 memories being 12 reasons for him reaching his depressed state. At the time this wasn't mentioned, but the revelation that Healy was depressed ties in with the band's decision to take longer writing and releasing their next work. In 2004, Travis embarked on a highly successful tour of Canada, the US, and Europe (supported by Keane in the UK), and on November 2004, the band released a successful compilation of their singles, Singles, as well as the new tracks, \\"Walking in the Sun\\" and \\"The Distance\\" (written by Dougie Payne). This was followed by a series of small, intimate gigs at UK venues such as Liverpool's Cavern Club, London's Mean Fiddler, and Glasgow's Barrowlands. While on tour, the band also made a series of impromptu acoustic \\"busks\\", raising money for the charity The Big Issue. In addition to other performances, they also headlined the 2005 Isle of Wight Festival and T in the Park. On 2 July 2005, Travis performed at Live 8's London concert, and four days later, at the Edinburgh 50,000 - The Final Push concert. Travis also participated in Band Aid 20's re-recording of \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\"--Healy and friend Nigel Godrich playing leading roles in its organisation. Healy is a part of the Make Poverty History movement, having recently made two trips to Sudan with the Save the Children organisation. On 13 July 2006, the members of Travis stuck a giant post-it sticker on the front door of the Downing Street home of British Prime Minister, Tony Blair.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes?\\" is \\"pollen\\", given that mitosis is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes? A:","completion":"No, I don't think that \\"pollen\\" is the right answer to the question \\"what is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes?\\" given that mitosis is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes. To answer this question more accurately, we should explore the differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and discuss some key features that make eukaryotes more complex. Eukaryotes and prokaryotes are two distinct categories of organisms, with the main difference between them being the presence or absence of a distinct nucleus in their cells. Eukaryotic cells, found in animals, plants, fungi, and protists, have a nucleus enclosed by a nuclear membrane that houses the DNA. On the other hand, prokaryotic cells, found in bacteria and archaea, lack a distinct nucleus, and their DNA is contained within a nucleoid region. In light of the distinction mentioned above, several aspects of eukaryotes make them more complex than prokaryotes: 1. Mitosis: As you rightly pointed out, mitosis is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes. Eukaryotic cells divide through a controlled process involving multiple phases such as prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, followed by cytokinesis. Prokaryotes divide by binary fission, which is a simpler process where the DNA replication and segregation of the cellular contents occur simultaneously. 2. Compartmentalization: Eukaryotic cells have various membrane-bound organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, chloroplasts (in plants), and lysosomes that compartmentalize the cell and participate in specific cellular functions. Prokaryotic cells, however, do not possess these membrane-bound organelles, and their metabolic processes occur within the cytoplasm or on the plasma membrane. 3. Genetic material: Eukaryotes possess linear DNA molecules with histone proteins to form chromatin, which can be further organized into chromosomes within the nucleus. They also have more genes than prokaryotes due to introns, which are non-coding sequences that allow for alternative splicing and gene expression regulation. In contrast, prokaryotes have circular DNA molecules and lack introns, encompassing a more compact genome. 4. Cytoplasmic organization: The eukaryotic cytoplasm exhibits a complex organization, including a cytoskeleton composed of actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments that help maintain the cell's shape and facilitate intracellular transport. The prokaryotic cytoplasm lacks this level of organization and contains only a few homologous proteins to those found in eukaryotes. 5. Gene expression and regulation: Eukaryotic cells have more sophisticated mechanisms for gene expression regulation, such as transcription factors, chromatin remodeling, RNA splicing, and epigenetic modifications. Prokaryotic cells, on the other hand, primarily regulate gene expression at the level of transcription initiation through the use of operons, which are simpler in comparison. In summary, several aspects make eukaryotes more complex than prokaryotes, such as mitosis, compartmentalization, genetic material organization, cytoplasmic organization, and gene expression regulation. Pollen, which is a structure found in seed plants, does not appropriately address the complexity differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Instead, the mentioned aspects better explain the complexity found in eukaryotic cells compared to prokaryotic cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. After this story is over the author probably: A. Will continue to do self portraits in the classes they teach. B. Will teach more English Language Learners C. Will stop showing student how to and just let them figure it out. D. not enough information The answer to this question is:","completion":"A. Will continue to do self portraits in the classes they teach. The author of this passage demonstrates a clear understanding of the educational value of self-portraits and has experience incorporating them into their lessons for students of various ages.

Here is a news article: ZURICH has leapfrogged ahead of Tokyo in the league table of the world’s most expensive cities after the Swiss franc’s sharp rise and its allure as a safe-haven currency for investors sent the cost of living soaring. The Swiss city, which is now almost 50 per cent more expensive than London, has jumped from fifth place, while Geneva rose six places into joint third alongside Japanese city Osaka, according to the Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit. The survey of 130 cities worldwide showed that despite Eurozone troubles, German and French cities have stayed relatively expensive with Paris and Frankfurt holding firm in the league table in sixth and tenth place. Even though inflation levels passed five per cent last year, a weaker pound meant London actually fell slightly in the ranking from 15th to 17th place. The Norwegian capital, Oslo, which was ranked the world’s most expensive city only a few years ago, dropped two places to fifth place. Strong currency shifts have also propelled five Australian cities into the top 20, led by Sydney and Melbourne in seventh and eighth places. “Exchange rates have been the greatest influence for the Australian cost of living, with the Australian dollar seeing its value to the US dollar double in a decade,” survey editor Jon Copestake said in the statement. Meanwhile Asian cities moved up the ranking, with Singapore gaining one place to ninth spot and Seoul climbing nine places to 27th, highlighting a shift away from the traditionally more expensive Western Europe hubs. Cities from the Asia Pacific region have continued to boom and now make up half of the top ten, but Western Europe still accounts for 24 of the most expensive cities in the top 50, with 14 hailing from Asia. Asia was also home to some of the cheapest cities. Three of the four cheapest were in the Indian subcontinent. These included New Delhi and Mumbai in India, and Karachi in Pakistan, which was the cheapest of cities surveyed. The bi-annual survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit compares more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services such as food, transport, housing, utilities and private schools. For example, the price of a loaf of bread has more than doubled in London in ten years, with the cost of a bottle of wine rising by 50 per cent. Taxes have also played a part, with petrol pump prices up by over 75 per cent and cigarette prices by almost 60 per cent. “Over time we have seen the price of commodity driven groceries like bread and petrol rise substantially. However, less essential items have actually been falling in price recently, after rising during better economic times,” Copestake said. Canada’s Vancouver has overtaken all US cities to become the most expensive in North America, ranked 37th. Los Angeles was the most expensive US city -- equal 42nd with Shanghai -- while New York was 47th. ||||| The cost of living across the globe ZURICH has become the world's most expensive city to live in, according to the latest Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister company.

The index measures the cost of an expatriate lifestyle in over 130 cities using a weighted average of the prices of 160 products and services. New York's figure is set to 100 to provide a base for comparisons. The relative strengths of currencies and economies are reflected in changes to the rankings.

These markets often serve as a hub for local commerce where vendors and merchants gather to offer a wide range of products, including fresh produce, meats, fish, spices, textiles, and other merchandise to the public.

It was a significant part of Haussmann's urban planning vision for Paris, which aimed at transforming the city's narrow streets and outdated infrastructure into a more modern and functional urban environment. Les Halles was eventually demolished in 1971 to make way for the construction of the modern shopping center known as \\"Forum des Halles,\\" which still serves as a commercial hub for the city today.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: If you fall into one of these categories, there’s no getting around pre-lightening with bleach before going lighter. If you have virgin hair, you can usually go a few shades lighter with a high-lift boxed dye. Going from dark brown hair to blonde with hair dye alone is probably unrealistic, but you can definitely lighten up virgin hair without bleach. For example, if you have light brown hair that’s never been dyed, you can dye it blonde without using bleach. If you have dark brown virgin hair, you can dye it light brown or red without using bleach. Buy the dye that depicts the hair color you want to achieve on the box; you don't need to amend anything to account for darker hair as long as it's virgin. If you have red, light brown, or medium brown hair, use vol 20 developer. If you have black or dark brown hair, use vol 30 developer. If you aren’t sure, err on the side of caution and get the lower vol 20 developer. You can always bleach again if you need to! Avoid vol 40 developer, which is the strongest developer available. It’s too harsh to use all over your head and is typically used by professional stylists or for highlighting small sections of hair. Bleach can irritate and even burn your scalp, but the natural oils that build up when you don’t wash it can add a layer of protection. At minimum, avoid washing for 48 hours before bleaching. You may also want to do several conditioning masks in the 2 weeks prior to bleaching to minimize damage and breakage. Go with intensely hydrating masks and conditioners with nourishing ingredients like shea butter and Argan oil. Part your hair down the center, vertically, from the crown to the nape of your neck. Then divide those sections in half, horizontally, from ear to ear. Clip each section in place on top of your head with a plastic hair clip. Don't use metal clips when you're bleaching your hair. Dividing your hair into 4 manageable quadrants makes the bleaching process easier and helps to ensure the color is stripped evenly. Your bleach kit will contain both powder and developer, as well as an applicator and pair of plastic gloves. Put on the gloves and an old-t-shirt before you start mixing. Then, measure and pour both ingredients into a bowl. Mix them together until they’re thoroughly incorporated. Make sure you follow the mixing directions on the packaging. You may need to combine them in a ratio of 1:1 or 1:2. Use the bleach immediately after mixing it. At this point, drape a towel around your shoulders to protect your skin during the process. You can also add a swipe of petroleum jelly along your hairline to protect the skin around your forehead and face. Start with the bottom sections before moving on to the top ones. As you work, separate each section into several smaller sections. Remove the clip to release the first section of hair, section it, and use the applicator brush that came with your kit to apply the bleach mixture onto each section from root to tip. Get as close to the roots as possible without touching your scalp. Once the section is saturated with the mixture, clip it back up and out of the way. Work as quickly as you can, since the bleach mixture loses strength the longer it sits out. The bleach will still work if you let it sit out for a few hours, but it will take longer to process your hair and generally be less effective. Dividing your hair into smaller sections will help you evenly apply the bleach. If your hair is thick, it's especially important that you make many small sections. Unclip the next section and apply the bleach mixture from root to tip. Clip it back up and continue the same process until all 4 sections are thoroughly saturated. Try to apply the bleach in thin layers to small areas at a time so that all of your hair gets coated evenly. Check the bleach kit packaging for instructions about timing. In general, the darker your hair is, the longer the bleach mixture should sit on your hair. 30 to 45 minutes is pretty typical. You can put a clear, plastic cap over your hair while it processes. This helps control the bleach so it's less messy. Also, the cap traps in your head's natural heat. Be sure to check your progress every 5 to 10 minutes to avoid over-processing your hair. Never leave bleach on your hair for longer than 1 hour. The cold water stops the bleach from processing your hair, so try to rinse quickly and thoroughly for even results. Follow the rinse up by shampooing your hair twice in a row, rinsing thoroughly with cold water in between, to make sure you remove all of the bleach.

A rescue kitten will undergo a life-threatening recovery surgery today after it underwent a routine microchip surgery last week that left him paralyzed. Muffin, who was just six-weeks-old when Loren Slama rescued him, was taken to Downey Animal Shelter after being found wandering the streets of Los Angeles last week. After taking Muffin home from the shelter for routine medical microchip implantation, Slama made the horrifying realization that something went very wrong. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Suffering: Muffin is just six-weeks-old and left paralyzed after a botched routine surgery last week. Hope: Thanks to funding from generous donors, Muffin has enough money to undergo a life-threatening surgery today to remove the chip that left her paralyzed and dragging her tiny body across the floor. The chip: The microchip, an implant used to help identify pets, was meant to go just below the surface of the skin but ended up being lodged in her spine. Microchips are are radio-frequency identification (RFID) implants that provide permanent ID for a pet, reports Petfinder.com. They are meant to be implanted just below the surface of the skin and are not normally painful or invasive. They give each pet a personal identification number and even medical histry in the case that the pet is lost. Chip implantation is often a required surgery for rescue pets and usually have little to no complications. Slama said that as soon as she took Muffin home, his adorable little face started to dangle then crash towards the floor all together. She decided to get to the bottom of what was ailing her new pet after leaving the vet. An X-ray showed that a microchip that doctors implanted as part of the routine process had gotten lodged into the kitten's spine., reportsCBS. Now the six-week-old Muffin has to drag its entire left side when it moves. Loved: Loren Slama rescued six-week-old Muffin from the harsh streets of Los Angeles last week and wants her to be healthy and happy in her caring home. Immobilized: Muffin can barely move and when she does, she must drag the left side of her body on the floor. Horrified: Owner Loren Slama says that thanks to generous donors, Muffin might have a chance at recovery after a life-threatening surgery today to remove the chip. X-ray: X-rays show that the chip went right through Muffin's spinal cord causing debilitating paralysis. 'I noticed after 30 minutes his head started to dangle and it started to kind of crash. On the X-ray it was clearly demonstrated that the microchip was inserted all the way into the spine. That’s why he was paralyzed,' Slama said. 'I was in a total state of shock,' Slama added. Muffin has a surgery scheduled for Today at the Angels Veterinary Specialty Center where a neurologist will attempt to remove the chip. The surgery is very risky and Muffin might die during or shortly after but Slama has no choice if she wants Muffin to have a chance at surviving free of pain. Slama asked Downey Animal Control to pay for the surgery since it was their doctor who implanted a microchip but they declined. 'It’s a highly risky procedure. He might die during the surgery and even a few days after the surgery. However, we need to do the surgery because the longer the microchip stays into the spine the more damage it can cause,' Slama said. Catastrophe: Muffin was left paralyzed but if he survives today's surgery he may have a change at a normal life. The proof: Animal Control is investigating what may have went wrong during the surgery that left a poor kitten paralyzed with a microchip implanted in his spine. Hopeful: Today's surgery to remove the chip could help Muffin lead a more normal life after becoming paralyzed. The Los Angeles Department of Animal Control and Care released a statement about their reasoning for not funding the surgery. 'This was an anomaly. We acted in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines in terms of whether the kitten should be micro chipped for its age and size. 'We have never had an incident like this before. However, we are conducting an investigation and determining whether or not any corrections need to be made,' they said. Despite Los Angeles Animal Control's lack of funding, Slama was able to raise money through caring donors on Youcaring.com. They reached over their 5,000 goal. 'Dear Supporters and Animal Lovers,. WE HAVE REACHED OUR GOAL!!!!! We have left the fund raiser open, since once it is closed, we will be unable to update all of Muffin's friends. NO NEED TO DONATE MORE! We are overwhelmed by your generosity. Because of you, Muffin will get the finest care with the best surgical team. Please keep Muffin in your thoughts and prayers that he survives the surgery, and lives a long, healthy kitty life. THANK YOU from the bottom of every rescuer's heart,' says the site. Loren Slama promises to keep supporters updated on Muffin's recovery.

Hookworms are parasitic worms that belong to the phylum Nematoda, also known as roundworms, and specifically to the family Ancylostomatidae. These worms are predominantly found in the small intestine of humans and animals, usually in warmer and more tropical regions. Hookworms are characterized by their mouthparts, which resemble hooks, enabling them to attach to the intestinal walls of their host. They feed on the host's blood, causing hookworm disease or ancylostomiasis. In humans, there are two primary species of hookworms responsible for causing infections: Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. Infections typically occur when an individual comes into contact with contaminated soil or feces harboring hookworm larvae. The larvae penetrate the skin and make their way into the circulatory system, eventually reaching the lungs. They then travel up the trachea and are swallowed, thus reaching the small intestine, where they mature into adults and begin to lay eggs. The eggs are excreted through the host's feces, making their way back into the environment and restarting the life cycle. Some common ways for human hookworm infection include walking barefoot on contaminated soil or consuming food contaminated with the larvae. Hookworm infection in humans can lead to a wide range of symptoms, such as anemia, lethargy, and stomach pain, and can also cause developmental and cognitive issues in children. In summary, hookworms are parasitic worms that cause infections in both humans and animals, primarily in warmer and tropical regions. The answer to this question is both an entity as they refer to a specific type of parasitic worms, and a description since the term \\"hookworm\\" provides information about the characteristics and nature of these parasites."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Passage:Al-Maqrīzī was born in Fatimid Cairo and spent most of his life in Egypt, When he presents himself in his books he usually stops at the 10th forefather although he confessed to some of his close friends that he can trace his ancestry to Al-Mu‘izz li-Dīn Allāh -first Fatimid caliph in Egypt and the founder of al-Qahirah- and even to Ali ibn Abi Talib. He was trained in the Hanafite school of law. Later, he switched to the Shafi'ite school and finally to the Zahirite school. Maqrizi studied theology under one of the primary masterminds behind the Zahiri Revolt, and his vocal support and sympathy with that revolt against the Mamluks likely cost him higher administrative and clerical positions with the Mamluk regime. The name Maqrizi was an attribution to a quarter of the city of Baalbek, from where his paternal grandparents hailed. Maqrizi confessed to his contemporaries that he believed that he was related to the Fatimids through the son of al-Muizz. Ibn Hajar preserves the most memorable account: his father, as they entered the al-Hakim Mosque one day, told him \\"My son, you are entering the mosque of your ancestor.\\" However, his father also instructed al-Maqrizi not to reveal this information to anyone he could not trust; Walker concludes: Links: a.

Write highlights for this article: By. Sarah Griffiths. A toddler born with a rare joint condition is able to walk for the first time after wearing 'concrete trousers'. Harrison Hobson had to wear an unusual double leg cast to fix a condition that caused one of his hips to be permanently dislocated. For the first six months of his life, the baby’s legs had to be kept in an awkward shape in a harness, before being encased in the ‘concrete trousers’. Harrison Hobson, had to wear the unusual double leg cast (pictured left) to cure his dysplasia - a condition that caused his hip to be permanently dislocated. After two operations and a long recovery, he can now run around (pictured right) like any other toddler. Doctors noticed a problem with Harrison’s hips just before his mother Charlotte Hobson, 33, was due to take him home from hospital after his birth. Medics diagnosed the newborn with dysplasia, after his hip joint failed to form properly around the top of his leg, causing his right hip to constantly dislocate. At just four days old, Harrison was placed in a full body harness that locked his hip into a fixed position. For nine out of ten dysplasis cases this is enough to solve the problem, but when Harrison’s hip failed to heal, doctors decided to operate placing his legs in a plaster cast at five weeks old. The procedure was found to have failed a week after it was performed and Harrison had a second more invasive operation and a new cast fitted. For three and a half months, Mrs Hobson had to deal with the challenge of trying to change, dress and bathe a baby stuck in the unusual cast. Doctors noticed the problem with Harrison’s hips shortly after his birth. At just four days old, he was placed in a full body harness that kept his hip locked into position, before being fitted with the cast (pictured left) He has now made a full recovery (right) Mrs Hobson (pictured with husband Jason) was at first apprehensive as to whether she and her husband Jason would be able to hold their baby with his new cast, but they were given advise from dysplasia charity Steps about how to care for their son while he was in his plaster cast. The new mother was at first apprehensive, worrying whether she and her husband Jason would be able to hold their baby with his new cast. They were advised by dysplasia charity Steps, that they should not pick him up from under his arm pits because the cast was too heavy and instead were taught a new method of carrying their son around. After Harrison’s cast came off, Mrs Hobson was worried he would take longer than other children to reach the milestones of standing and walking. But at 14 months old, Harrison took his first steps and now aged two, he is running around like any other boisterous toddler. Mrs Hobson, from Bristol, said: ‘It was such an unusual cast and it doesn’t look comfortable at all so it was heart-breaking to know that my son had to be stuck like that for so long. ‘It’s not a natural position and as a mum you just don’t want your baby to be in pain. ‘The harness he was in for his first three months fixed him a pose like he was sitting on a saddle. Mrs Hobson said: 'The harness he was in for his first three months fixed him a pose like he was sitting on a saddle. Then the cast was like a pair of concrete trousers (pictured). They were so big and bulky and I was worried people would laugh at him' ‘And then the cast was like a pair of concrete trousers. They were so big and bulky and I was worried people would laugh at him.’ She said her son's diagnosis came as a shock after reading ‘every single parenting book’ when she was pregnant, finding no warning about hip dysplasia. At first, doctors thought both her son's hips had fallen victim to the condition, before concluding it was just Harrison's right hip was affected. ‘Just before we were due to go home from the hospital, a doctor wiggled his hips around and told me that they were both dislocated,' she said. At 14 months old, Harrison took his first steps and now aged two, he is running around like any other boisterous toddler. ‘My husband Jason is a professional rugby. player and has seen a fair few injuries in his time so I thought it. would be just a case of clicking them back in. ‘But then they explained to me about hip dysplasia - it was a horrible sinking feeling. You could feel his hip click in and out.’ Mrs Hobson said that it was hard to imagine the cast before it was on her baby. ‘I just had all these questions about whether he was going to be in pain, whether I’d be able to keep him clean and tidy. Would I even be able to find him clothes big enough to fit over the cast? ‘But with all the help from Steps we managed to deal with the “concrete trousers” situation and people were only sympathetic when we explained what was wrong. ‘Once he finally got out of his cast it was such a feeling of relief. Now you’d never know that he’d ever had a problem.’ Tim McLachlan, CEO of Steps said: ‘Steps receives calls from parents across the UK who are upset at being asked by strangers “how did you manage to break both their legs?” referring to their toddler who is in a hip spica cast from waist to ankles. ‘Hip dysplasia is a common condition, but not common knowledge and we need to change this. ‘Developmental dysplasia of the hip affects one to three per cent of all births in the UK regardless of background - that’s up to 24,000 children per year or an entire class in an every average secondary school. ‘It’s more than the number of new diagnoses of leukaemia and skin cancer combined.’ Highlights:","completion":"- Harrison Hobson, a toddler with a rare joint condition called dysplasia, was able to walk for the first time after wearing an unusual double leg cast, also known as \\"concrete trousers\\". - Dysplasia caused Harrison's hip to be permanently dislocated due to his hip joint failing to form properly around the top of his leg. - At four days old, Harrison was placed in a full-body harness that locked his hip into a fixed position; however, this did not resolve the issue. - At five weeks old, Harrison underwent an operation and had his legs encased in the double leg cast. The first procedure failed, and he had a second, more invasive operation and a new cast fitted. - Harrison's mother, Charlotte Hobson, faced challenges of changing, dressing, and bathing her baby while he was in the cast. - The family received advice and support from dysplasia charity Steps, which helped them with methods to carry and care for their son while in the cast. - Harrison took his first steps at 14 months old and now, aged two, he is running around like any other toddler. - Developmental dysplasia of the hip affects 1-3% of all births in the UK, totaling up to 24,000 children per year. Steps aims to raise awareness about this common but lesser-known condition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state. Members of the state's Access to Justice Network, these organizations work with thousands of volunteer attorneys to ensure that justice is available to those who face critical legal problems and can't afford private legal counsel.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: Before you begin putting your brochure together, you'll need to know a little bit about the subject you've chosen or been assigned. Review your textbook, notes, and homework assignments to learn as much as you can. The more familiar you are with the material, the better your brochure will turn out. Other resources, such as the encyclopedia and various educational websites, can help you dive deeper into your topic. Only use sources that have been approved by your teacher, and be sure to cite your external sources on the last page of your brochure. Think about the best way to present your topic. You might offer a general overview of a complex subject, or zoom in on one or two specific points. The best brochures display information in a simple, focused way. If you're making a brochure on the Declaration of Independence, for example, you'd want to briefly summarize what the document says and name all of the people who signed it. Put your title front and center on the outermost panel, the one that will be visible while the brochure is folded. That way, it will be the first thing your reader sees. Beneath your title, display your full name to make it clear who created the brochure. Try to come up with a title that's short, punchy, and easy to remember. The title of your brochure should let your reader know what to expect right away. For a brochure about climate change, you could go with a straightforward title like “Climate Change,” or think of something more attention-grabbing, such as “Climate Change: The Silent Killer.” In 3-5 sentences, give your reader a general introduction to the subject you'll be exploring in your brochure. Your introduction will set the stage for the rest of the brochure and help the reader better understand the information they're about to be given. An introduction to a geography brochure on the Maldives might say something like this: “The Maldives is a country in Asia located south of India and Sri Lanka. It is made up of a chain of 26 small islands. The Maldives have a sunny, tropical climate, which makes it a popular getaway for vacationers from around the world.” The inside of your brochure is where you'll actually present the facts you've collected about your subject. Devote each panel to a single subject to prevent information on one subtopic from spilling over into the next page. Writing in short sentences or even bullet points can also make it easier for your reader to follow along. Think about whether you want a basic single-fold brochure or a traditional tri-fold brochure. Single-fold styles tend to work best for shorter, more straightforward topics, whereas tri-fold brochures make it easier to organize lots of information in a manageable way. For a brochure about dietary nutrients, you might use a portion of each of the three interior panels to explain the role of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. In some cases, the amount of information you have to discuss will determine how many pages your brochure will end up being. In others, your teacher may specify a certain number of pages. Make sure you follow instructions carefully. End your brochure by offering your reader a quick recap of the most important points you covered in the preceding panels. Use simple, direct language to clear up any confusion they may have about what they've just read. A good rule of thumb is to include at least one key detail from each of your interior panels in your summary on the final panel. You can either leave the center outside panel blank or use it to list any external sources you used to do your research, such as books or websites.","completion":"To create an effective brochure, start by researching your chosen or assigned subject using textbooks, notes, and approved sources like encyclopedias and educational websites.

Write an article based on this summary: A suspended Liberal Democrat candidate in Newport has resigned from the party and accused them of treating him as \\"guilty until proven innocent\\". Article:","completion":"Title: Suspended Liberal Democrat Candidate Resigns, Accuses Party of Treating Him as \\"Guilty Until Proven Innocent\\" Introduction A former Liberal Democrat candidate from Newport, who was suspended by the party, has claimed that the party treated him unfairly. He alleges they treated him as \\"guilty until proven innocent\\" during an investigation into his conduct. In light of these accusations, the disgruntled candidate has officially resigned from the party, creating a significant disturbance within the local political community. Resignation and allegations The Liberal Democrat candidate in question had been suspended by the party following allegations against him. However, they did not reveal the specific nature of the charges. Despite the suspension, the candidate expressed his sadness about leaving the party and accused the Liberal Democrats of denying him a fair chance to defend himself. Step-by-step analysis of the process Upon receiving the allegations, the Liberal Democrat administration had decided to suspend the candidate temporarily, pending further investigation. The candidate claims the party disregarded the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty,' which is crucial in maintaining a fair and just system. During this investigation period, the accused candidate had hoped for an impartial review. However, he believes this never happened as the party treated him as guilty from the outset. The candidate's statement on the matter In a public statement, the resigned Liberal Democrat candidate mentioned that it is essential for political parties to provide their members with a transparent and fair investigation process. He explained how his treatment by the party had left him deeply disappointed and decided that he could no longer be a part of a party that appeared to be projecting irresponsible behavior. Impact on the local political scene The candidate's resignation and accusations against the Liberal Democrats have created a stir in Newport's political scene, raising concerns among fellow politicians and locals. His departure has also led critics to question the party's methods, demanding answers on their investigation process and policies. Some Liberal Democrat party members have expressed their solidarity with the resigned candidate, stating that they too have concerns over the party’s internal processes. Conclusion The situation in Newport signifies that political parties must ensure that fair and just processes are in place for allegations and investigations against their own members. Upholding the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty' is vital for building trust and maintaining credibility among party members and the public. To restore faith in their system, the Liberal Democrats must take this opportunity to review and potentially reform their investigative processes to ensure fairness and transparency in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Question: This article: Carl Schaffner is a crooked British (previously German) businessman who flees to Mexico after stealing company funds. While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport. Carl arrives in Mexico and is captured by the local police, who mistake him for Scarff. Carl then fights to show his true identity to the local police. The plan seems foolproof until he is forced to care for the dog of Scarff's dog. The local police chief and Scotland Yard inspector Hadden conspire to keep him trapped in the Mexican border town of Katrina in an effort to get him to cross the bridge back into the U.S. and face justice. The misanthropic Schaffner has grown attached to Scarff's pet spaniel and is tricked into going across the dividing line of the bridge to get the dog. He is accidentally killed trying to escape the authorities. The final irony is that the discovery of his own humanity has cost the cynical, friendless Schaffner his life. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who switches identities with Paul?, what is it ?

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: indirectly impacting a step of the process. In springtime, various factors such as increased temperature, daylight duration, and rain availability can affect plant growth. While the spring season itself doesn't directly alter the way roots pass water through vessels, it does create conditions that can indirectly impact the process. During spring, increased rain availability provides more water for the plants, and the warmer temperatures allow roots to function more efficiently. Additionally, the longer daylight duration in spring leads to increased photosynthesis, which in turn, influences the plant's water consumption, as more water is required for maintaining proper photosynthetic rates. These factors can lead to an increased rate of water absorption by the roots, as the plant consumes more water to support its growth during the spring. Consequently, the process of water being transported through vessels in the stem to the leaves may be indirectly impacted by the spring conditions, through changes in the plant's overall water requirements and availability."},{"prompt":"I heard that Carson was away at college.

We have: 122 * r - 291 * r - 8773 = -11 * r + 125 * r First, let's add the \\"r\\" terms on each side of the equation. On the left side, combine the r terms (122*r - 291*r) together: (122 - 291) * r - 8773 = -11 * r + 125 * r Now, 122 - 291 is equal to -169. So, our equation now looks like this: -169 * r - 8773 = -11 * r + 125 * r Next, let's do the same with the right side of the equation, and combine the r terms (-11*r + 125*r): -169 * r - 8773 = (125 - 11) * r Now, 125 - 11 is equal to 114. So, our equation looks like this: -169 * r - 8773 = 114 * r Now, we want to get all the r terms on one side and the number (in this case, -8773) on the other side. So, let's add 169*r to both sides of the equation: -169 * r + 169 * r - 8773 = 114 * r + 169*r This simplifies to: -8773 = 114 * r + 169 * r Now, let's combine the r terms on the right side (114*r + 169*r): -8773 = (114 + 169) * r Now, 114 + 169 is equal to 283. So, our equation looks like this: -8773 = 283 * r Now, in order to find the value of r, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 283: -8773 / 283 = 283 * r / 283 This simplifies to: -31 = r So, the value of r is -31."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The IC3 is like a group of super smart detective grown-ups who solve mysteries on the internet. They can help you file a report to tell others about what happened, so they can also keep an eye out for the bad people. Remember, keeping your personal information safe is very important. But if something goes wrong, and your personal information is stolen, it's important to tell the right grown-ups. They can help catch the bad people and fix the problems. When you grow up, don't forget to keep your personal information safe, and always tell someone if you think it has been stolen."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. (CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings. Question: \\"What rules exist throughout the country because of a California ban?\\" Answer: \\"Anti tanning laws\\" Is this answer correct? Select from the following. [1]. no; [2]. yes;...I think the answer is","completion":"[1]. No. The answer provided above does not accurately reflect the information in the news piece. The news piece mentions that California has been a pioneer in initiating various public health policies which are later adopted by other states. Some of these significant initiatives include requiring smog check for clean air, passing anti-tobacco initiatives, bike helmets laws, and banning smoking in workplaces, bars, and restaurants. However, the statement regarding anti-tanning laws requires more context. The passage does note that teenager’s use of tanning booths has been banned in California, but it does not indicate that these rules have been adopted throughout the entirety of the country. Therefore, while \\"anti-tanning laws\\" might exist in other states following California's initiative, it's not accurate to claim that all states adhere to this rule as an absolute fact. The California ban that has been explicitly stated in the passage to have led to similar rules throughout the country is the ban on smoking in workplaces, bars, and restaurants. While others might have been acted upon, it is not explicitly stated in this passage. Therefore, a more accurate answer to the question, \\"What rules exist throughout the country because of a California ban?\\" based on the provided text would be the rules concerning smoking in workplaces, bars, and restaurants. It is necessary when interpreting such a broad question to consider the concrete details provided within the text, and not to make assumptions beyond these details. Even while the passage does detail California's innovative nature in terms of public health initiatives, it is not to say that all of these initiatives are adopted universally across all states in the country. Therefore, it is important to carefully dissect the information provided to answer such questions correctly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The base commander is an old friend, Lt. Col. \\"Mac\\" MacDonald, working with Squadron Leader Barrett (Reginald Denny, himself a World War I aerial observer), who is in charge of the Royal Air Force cadets at the base. Steve says he wants the job because he is too old for combat and the war will be won by pilots trained on bases like Thunderbird, but it is soon clear that he chose this base because his former girlfriend, Kay Saunders, lives nearby with her grandfather, retired Colonel Cyrus \\"Gramps\\" Saunders, also a close friend of Steve's.

Challenged by a tough case manager to build a life despite his injuries, he is emotionally supported by his roommate, a blind man named Lewis, but receives only financial support from his wealthy family. He works nights, cleaning a small-town bank, with regular visitations from Ted, a sheriff's deputy. Chris aspires to train as a teller, but the bank manager, Mr. Tuttle, can barely hide his contempt for Chris's ambitions.

Sewell's cricket career included playing for Bedfordshire, Dorset, and Cambridge University. He had the honor of playing in five first-class matches and demonstrated a fair level of skill with both bat and ball. As a batsman, he scored a total of 69 runs, while as a bowler, he took 6 wickets in the 372 deliveries that he bowled. Although Sewell did not achieve a five-wicket haul (5 wickets in a single innings) or a ten-wicket haul (10 wickets in a single match), he was certainly a valuable player for his teams. In addition to his bowling and batting abilities, Sewell was a proficient fielder, having made four catches throughout his first-class matches. However, there are no records of him making any stumpings. Despite not having extraordinary statistics, Sewell's involvement in cricket showcases the spirit of sportsmanship and love for the game in the early years of the sport. Later in his life, Frederick Sewell passed away on June 5, 1964, in Parkstone, Dorset, England.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which of the following people was not purified: Mary, Jesus or Luke? Context: Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \\"purification\\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \\"purification\\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \\"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \\"prepurified\\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \\"Conception of St. Ann [i.e., of the Theotokos in her womb]\\" was becoming popular. After this period, the \\"purification\\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius).

One day, some people found out that Mr. Gargan made some mistakes while doing his job. These mistakes were called \\"misconduct.\\" Misconduct is when someone does not follow the rules properly or does something that is not right. The people who found out about Mr. Gargan's mistakes said, \\"Uh-oh! We need to figure out how many mistakes he made and what we should do about it.\\" So, they looked very carefully and found that Mr. Gargan made eight mistakes. That's quite a lot of mistakes! After they found out about the mistakes, the people had to decide what to do next. They thought about it for a while and decided that even though Mr. Gargan made mistakes, he could still be a good policeman. So, they said, \\"Nick, you can come back to work with the other policemen, but you must be very careful not to make any more mistakes.\\" Everyone in Avon and Somerset was talking about Mr. Gargan and his mistakes. Some people were upset, but others thought that everyone sometimes makes mistakes and that it was good that he could come back to work. In the end, Mr. Gargan returned to his job as the Chief Constable with a promise to do better and not make any more mistakes. And so, in the land of Avon and Somerset, people went back to their normal lives, feeling that their policemen and Chief Constable would now be extra careful to follow the rules and keep everyone safe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

The city is famous for its well-preserved colonial architecture, vibrant arts scene, and being the birthplace of the traditional Peruvian dance, Marinera. It is also close to important archeological sites, such as the ancient city of Chan Chan, El Brujo, and the temples of the Sun and Moon. Chiclayo, on the other hand, is the fourth most populous city in Peru and is also located on the northern coast. This city is known as the \\"City of Friendship\\" and is the capital of the Lambayeque region. Founded in 1720, Chiclayo has grown into an important trade center and transportation hub in the northern part of the country. The city offers a variety of attractions for tourists, including its vibrant markets, museums like the Royal Tombs of Sipán Museum, and archaeological sites like the ancient city of Túcume or the Sipán tomb.

The works of art have been collected by the people of France over many centuries. It is the biggest art museum in the world. The Louvre has not always been a museum. The first building was a fort. In 1190, it was the king's castle with high walls and a round tower, which had a river around it to keep out the enemies. Over the years, the number of buildings around the castle grew. By 1350, the castle no longer needed a fort. The Louvre became a palace home for French kings and queens. During times of peace, new treasures were brought in. During the days of war, many treasures were stolen, and the buildings were damaged. When Francis I became king of France in 1515, he brought in many artists from other countries.

Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's.

Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to do it.

Hero sues Army over sex discrimination The disclosure that Major Siddique is seeking £650,000 compensation for the alleged loss of her career has angered many colleagues. One officer said: \\"It would be an absolute disgrace if she is awarded many hundreds of thousands of pounds when soldiers who lose arms and legs or suffer brain damage can only receive a maximum of £285,000. \\"The size of the claim, in this climate when many injured guys are getting just a fraction of the amount she is demanding, has caused a lot of upset in the Army. There is a very real sense of betrayal.\\" L/Bdr Ben Parkinson, who lost both legs in Afghanistan in 2006 when his vehicle struck a mine, will require 24-hour care for the rest of his life. So far he has received £285,000 in compensation, the maximum that can be awarded to injured troops. The SAS hostage crisis took place on September 19, 2005 following an undercover operation to identify a senior Iraqi policeman who was believed to be responsible for the murders and torture of dozens of civilians. The soldiers, who were disguised as Arabs, had their cover blown when they were spotted by plain clothes Iraqi policemen. A short gun battle broke out before the pair were captured and taken to the notorious Jamiat police station. Once the British headquarters learned that the two SAS men were being held, a team was quickly assembled to try to negotiate their release. The team was commanded by Lt Col James Woodham, who conducted the negotiations, while Major Siddique was sent along to explain the legal situation to the police chief. The team also consisted of two members of the SAS who provided \\"close protection\\". Senior officers have said that it was a dangerous mission and that there was a very real risk that the negotiating team might be taken prisoners themselves. Ultimately the negotiations failed and the SAS detainees were eventually rescued in a daring operation after they were moved from the jail into a nearby house. Warrior armoured vehicles smashed through the wall of the police station, while a force composed largely of SAS troopers stormed the house and rescued the captive soldiers. Following the rescue, riots broke out in the streets in Basra and a British serviceman was severely burned when his armoured vehicle was set on fire by protesters. The Iraqi justice minister ordered the British Army to hand over the soldiers and demanded unsuccessfully that they be put on trial for attempted murder. Lt Col Woodham won the Military Cross for the part he played in the rescue while Major Siddique received the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service. Her citation reads: \\"Major Rabia Siddique is commended for her support to units and their soldiers in ensuring they fully understood their legal powers.\\" A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: \\"This case is going to employment tribunal.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. Question: \\"Why was it easier to attack the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, than to find and seize the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda?\\" Response: \\"The CIA didn't want to put in time to track it\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

Step 1: Combine like terms. Since both 11*c and -183*c are like terms (both have the same variable c), we can easily combine them by subtracting their coefficients. 11*c - 183*c = -172*c Now the equation looks like this: -172*c + 3332 = 8836 Step 2: Move the constant to the right-hand side. To isolate the term with the variable c, we need to move the constant 3332 to the right-hand side of the equation. To do this, subtract 3332 from both sides of the equation. -172*c + 3332 - 3332 = 8836 - 3332 -172*c = 5504 Step 3: Solve for c.

Squidward is the reluctant neighbour and workmate of which children's cartoon character????","completion":"Squidward Tentacles is the reluctant neighbor and workmate of SpongeBob SquarePants in the popular children's cartoon series of the same name. The show, which first aired in 1999 on the Nickelodeon network, was created by animator and marine science educator Stephen Hillenburg. It takes place in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom, located at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. SpongeBob SquarePants follows the everyday life and adventures of the titular character, SpongeBob, an optimistically naive and enthusiastic sea sponge who lives in a pineapple-shaped house with his pet snail, Gary. SpongeBob works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, a popular fast-food restaurant famous for its signature Krabby Patty burgers, under the management of his penny-pinching boss, Mr. Krabs. Squidward, a perpetually grumpy and sarcastic cephalopod, is SpongeBob's coworker at the Krusty Krab, where he serves as the restaurant's cashier. His bitterness and annoyance with SpongeBob’s happy-go-lucky attitude frequently fuels the tension between them. Squidward is also SpongeBob's next-door neighbor, living in a giant Easter Island-like head made of stone called a Moai, just to the left of SpongeBob’s pineapple abode. As a result, Squidward constantly finds himself dragged into SpongeBob's various escapades, much to his dismay. The show often highlights Squidward's love for the arts, such as playing the clarinet, painting, dancing, and sculpting, although he consistently demonstrates little talent in these endeavors. Despite his pessimistic behavior, Squidward sometimes shows his softer side and inadvertently enjoys moments with SpongeBob and his other neighbor, Patrick Star, a dimwitted but good-natured starfish who is SpongeBob's best friend. Over the years, the SpongeBob SquarePants cartoon has gained substantial acclaim and has become a significant part of pop culture. The show has enjoyed a wide-ranging fan base, from young children to adults, and many find humor in its charming characters, zany storylines, and clever mix of slapstick comedy and wit. Squidward's strained relationship with SpongeBob and his fundamental desire for a life of tranquility and sophistication bring a unique dynamic to the show's overall narrative, making him an essential part of the beloved series."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At the time,the government was looking for a way to reduce traffic problems in the city of London. The poor areas of the city were so crowded with people that it was almost impossible for horse carriages to get through. The city officials were interested in trying to make it possible for workers to live outside of London and travel easily to work each day. If people had a cheap and convenient way that they could depend on to go to and from work, they would relocate their homes outside of the city. This would help ease the pressure of too many people living in the poor parts of London. From these problems,the idea of the London Underground,the first subway system,was born. The plans for building the Underground met with several problems and delays,but the fast track was finally opened in January 1863. A steam train pulled the cars along the fast underground track which was 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) long. About 30,000 people got on the subway the first day. Riders were treated to comfortable seats (standing up while the train was moving was not allowed), and pleasant decorations inside each of the cars. However, the smoke from the engine soon filled the air in the tunnels with ash and soot , as well as chemical gases. Fans had to be put in the tunnels later to keep the air clean enough for people to breathe. Even with its problems,riding in the Underground did . It carried 9 million riders in its first year.

Write the answer: During the American Civil War, what city was the capital of the Confederacy?","completion":"During the American Civil War, the capital city of the Confederacy was Richmond, Virginia. The American Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865, was a conflict primarily fought between the Northern states, also known as the Union, and the Southern states, known as the Confederate States of America. The primary cause of the war was the disagreement over the issues of states' rights, westward expansion, and most importantly, the institution of slavery. Richmond, Virginia, was chosen as the capital of the Confederate States of America due to several strategic and political reasons. First and foremost, Virginia itself was a crucial state for the Confederacy, as it was one of the most populous and economically vital states in the South. Additionally, many important political and military figures of the Confederacy, such as Robert E. Lee, were Virginians. The state's geographic location served as a buffer between the Northern states and the deeper Confederate territory, making its protection an essential aspect of the Confederate military strategy. Richmond's specific characteristics made it an ideal choice for the Confederate capital. The city was located about 100 miles south of Washington, D.C., making it strategically close to the Union capital and symbolically asserting the Confederate presence on the eastern seaboard. Richmond was also a transportation hub, with several railways and vital waterways, such as the James River, converging in the city. This transportation network was essential for efficiently moving troops, supplies, and information throughout the Confederacy. Additionally, Richmond was an important industrial center for the Confederacy. The city possessed significant iron and steel production facilities, such as the Tredegar Iron Works, which supplied much of the Confederate military's weaponry and artillery. Richmond's industrial capacity was vital for supporting and sustaining the Confederate war effort. However, Richmond's proximity to the Union capital and its strategic significance made it a primary target for the Union forces. Throughout the Civil War, several major battles and military campaigns, such as the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles in 1862, the Virginia campaigns led by Union General Ulysses S. Grant in 1864, and finally, the 1864-1865 Siege of Petersburg, were fought with the ultimate aim of capturing Richmond. The final days of the Confederate capital were marked by doom and desperation. As the Union armies closed in on the city and Confederate morale and resources dwindled, Richmond's residents faced food shortages, inflation, and deprivations. In April 1865, as General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia retreated in the face of advancing Union forces, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his government evacuated Richmond. The Union forces, led by General Grant, subsequently captured the city on April 3, 1865. Fires that accompanied the evacuation by the Confederates left much of the city in ruins. Richmond's fall marked the beginning of the end for the Confederacy. Mere days later, on April 9, 1865, General Lee surrendered to General Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, signaling the imminent collapse of the Confederate government and bringing the American Civil War to a close."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 2: Her meekness is counterbalanced by brevity. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? OPT: * yes * it is not possible to tell * no","completion":"It is not possible to tell. In the first sentence, it is described that Nora responds with both a touch of meekness and at last with a sense of her separable self. This sentence portrays Nora's response as somewhat meek but also underlines her individuality. The second sentence describes her meekness as counterbalanced by brevity. Brevity means being concise or brief in expressing her thoughts while not diluting the point she wants to make. Although both sentences mention meekness, they describe slightly different aspects of Nora's response. The first sentence gives us an understanding of her self-awareness and separable self, while the second sentence focuses on the balance between her meekness and the brevity of her response. Based on the information provided in these two sentences, we simply cannot conclude if the second sentence is true solely based on the first sentence. It is possible that Nora's response was indeed brief and thus counterbalancing her meekness, or it might be a longer, more elaborate response, in which case the second sentence would not be true.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person for whom the great Elizabethan mansion held enormous importance throughout the rest of her life? from the following article ? Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal. Her biographer Victoria Glendinning considers Sissinghurst to be Sackville-West's \\"one magnificent act of creation\\".","completion":"Based on the article, the last name of the person for whom the great Elizabethan mansion (Knole) held enormous importance throughout her life is Sackville-West.

The region, as part of Lorraine, was part of the Holy Roman Empire, and then was gradually annexed by France in the 17th century, and formalized as one of the provinces of France. The Calvinist manufacturing republic of Mulhouse, known as Stadtrepublik Mülhausen, became a part of Alsace after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798. Alsace is frequently mentioned with and as part of Lorraine and the former duchy of Lorraine, since it was a vital part of the duchy, and later because German possession as the imperial province (Alsace-Lorraine, 1871–1918) was contested in the 19th and 20th centuries; France and Germany exchanged control of parts of Lorraine (including Alsace) four times in 75 years. With the decline of the Roman Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Alemanni. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the youngest grandson Lothar I. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm).

About 4 million people visit Yosemite each year: most spend the majority of their time in the seven square miles (18 km) of Yosemite Valley. Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves, lakes, mountains, glaciers, and biological diversity. Almost 95% of the park is designated wilderness. Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea. First, Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln's signing the Yosemite Grant in 1864. Later, John Muir led a successful movement to establish a larger national park encompassing not just the valley, but surrounding mountains and forests as wellpaving the way for the United States national park system. - Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 April 15, 1865) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the United States through its Civil Warits bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. In doing so, he preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy. - Cary Anthony Stayner ( August 13 , 1961 ) is an American serial killer convicted of the murders of four women between February and July 1999 : Carole Sund , her teenaged daughter Juli Sund and their teenaged traveling companion Silvina Pelosso , and Yosemite Institute naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong . The murders occurred in Mariposa County , California , near Yosemite National Park . Stayner 's early family life was marked by the abduction of his younger brother , Steven , a kidnapping victim of convicted child molester , Kenneth Parnell . Cary Stayner was sentenced to death for the four murders , and remains , as of June 2015 , awaiting execution on death row at San Quentin Penitentiary in California . - John Muir (April 21, 1838 December 24, 1914) also known as \\"John of the Mountains\\", was a Scottish-American naturalist, author, environmental philosopher and early advocate of preservation of wilderness in the United States. His letters, essays, and books telling of his adventures in nature, especially in the Sierra Nevada of California and Nevada, have been read by millions. His activism helped to preserve the Yosemite Valley, Sequoia National Park and other wilderness areas. The Sierra Club, which he founded, is a prominent American conservation organization. The John Muir Trail, a hiking trail in the Sierra Nevada, was named in his honor. Other such places include Muir Woods National Monument, Muir Beach, John Muir College, Mount Muir, Camp Muir and Muir Glacier. In Scotland, the John Muir Way, a 130-mile-long route, was named in honor of him. - Kenneth Eugene Parnell (September 26, 1931 January 21, 2008) was an American convicted sex offender, known infamously for his kidnapping of seven-year-old Steven Stayner in Merced, California.

Is the premise \\"A couple heads in to Tavern on The Green.\\" true if \\"people are taking a taxi to a bar\\"?","completion":"It's impossible to determine if the premise \\"A couple heads into Tavern on The Green\\" is true based only on the statement \\"people are taking a taxi to a bar.\\" This is primarily due to a lack of specificity regarding who the \\"people\\" are, where they are going, and whether there could be any correlation between the two scenarios described. Let's break down each of the factors that need clarity in order to determine the truth of the original premise: 1. Identity of \\"People\\": The term \\"people\\" is quite vague. It could mean one couple, multiple couples, or a group of individuals. It doesn’t specify whether or not these people are the same couple mentioned in the other scenario. If they aren’t, the two statements would naturally be unrelated. 2. Destined Bar: While the second scenario does state that people are heading to a bar, it doesn't specify that the bar is Tavern on The Green. In any given location, there could be numerous bars where people might be headed. Thus, we cannot infer based only on the information provided that the bar they are heading to in a taxi is indeed Tavern on The Green. 3. Mode of Transport: The scenarios describe different modes of transport. In the first scenario, it isn’t specified how the couple is reaching Tavern on The Green. They could be walking, taking a bus, driving, cycling or using any other means of transportation. Meanwhile, in the second scenario, people are definitely taking a taxi. This doesn't necessarily mean that the taxi would end up at Tavern on The Green. Given these uncertainties, we can’t definitively establish a direct correlation between the two scenarios. To establish the truth of the proposition that a couple is heading into Tavern on The Green based on people taking a taxi to a bar, more information is needed. Specifically, we’d need to know that these \\"people\\" are indeed a couple and that the \\"bar\\" they're heading to is none other than Tavern on The Green."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The \\"premise\\" is like a starting idea or information we have; it says \\"yeah yeah running.\\" The \\"hypothesis\\" is something we try to guess or figure out; it says \\"Running, hmm, no.\\" Now we need to see if the premise (starting idea) tells us if the hypothesis (guess) is true or false. Premise: You like running. Hypothesis: You don't like running. So in simple words, the starting idea talks about liking running, and the guess talks about not liking running.

Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes amphetamines to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from Hitler himself. In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit. There is also a book of Ingrid's memoirs written by a friend which contains letters from Hitler which Antonio helped forge. Antonio is trying to teach the art of forgery to one of his sons, as this talent will be his only inheritance. The younger son, Miguel, who is twelve, sleeps around with older men. When Gloria confronts Miguel, telling him she knows he has been sleeping with older men (including his friend's father), Miguel responds: \\"I'm the master of my own body.\\" Gloria's eldest son, Toni, who is fourteen, wants to become a farmer and is saving up enough money to buy a farm by peddling heroin.

Question: When the police arrive who do they believet was responsible for the destruction? Movie title: Inspector Gadget Movie plot: John Brown is a security guard working at the Bradford robotics laboratory in Riverton, Ohio, run by Artemus Bradford and his daughter Brenda, whom Brown is attracted to. Brown wishes to become a police officer, with support from his niece Penny. Brenda and Artemus create a lifelike robotic foot as part of the Gadget Program, to create cybernetically augmented police officers. Tycoon Sanford Scolex attacks the lab, steals the foot, and has Artemus murdered before escaping in his limo. Brown chases him down in his car, which leads to it being destroyed by Scolex's explosive cigar, leaving Brown for dead, but a bowling ball coming from the fiery blast of Brown's destroyed car crushes Scolex's hand, forcing him to replace it with a mechanical claw. Brown survives the explosion, but is seriously injured. He becomes the first test subject for the Gadget Program, as a cyborg with countless gadgets he can activate by saying \\"Go, Go, Gadget\\". Under Brenda's guidance, Brown becomes Inspector Gadget. Scolex creates the alias \\"Claw\\" and uses the stolen technology to create his own robot for global domination, aided by his minions Kramer and Sykes, but the attempts fail. Much to the irritation of Chief Quimby, Gadget joins the police department, aided by his talking advanced car, the Gadgetmobile. However, Quimby refuses to give Gadget the Bradford case and instead assigns him to mediocre jobs, prompting Gadget to secretly investigate the case himself. Examining the evidence, he finds a connection to Scolexâs company, which Brenda has now gone to work for. Breaking into Scolex's lab, he locates the foot but is taken captive by Scolex, who discovers Gadget is powered by a processor chip, which Scolex removes, and has Sykes dump Gadget in a junkyard.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? This is often referred to as the \\"competency based performance management system.\\" Using this approach, skills and traits with levels of proficiency expected are assigned to every job. Based on this, you know exactly what to shoot for. You, the employee, can then absorb the precise skills required to keep you competent enough to take charge of your tasks, responsibilities, learning and growth. Not only this, it encourages you to aim for the highest level of competence in the most efficient and effective manner. When you know what is expected of you, you can rise to the top. . Mentors play a vital role in developing employees, aiding in their learning and growth. They can give you advice on establishing objectives, the strategies to be adopted to achieve the objectives, and keep your morale up, too. What's more, a mentor likely has access to resources and a vast network of people who can help as well. A mentoring relationship should focus on building and developing skills, competencies and personality. The personality aspect involves helping the mentee review his strengths and shortcomings, appropriate behavior and actions to be implemented, and work on improving communication skills, problem solving skills, and teamwork habits. Having a mentor could help you move in alignment with the expectations of the organization. This can to a great extent serve the purpose of reducing gaps between where you stand and what is expected of you &dash; both in the short and long term. There is a growing need for employees to keep pace with the changing trends and technologies at the workplace. They need to keep their skills updated at all times – it's not just you! Because of this, a lot of workplaces offer training. One of the best ways to keep pace and eliminate or minimize employee gap is through the training program at your work. If your work offers one, take advantage of it! Not all training programs suit every employee. The training program should be one offered by your work, chosen carefully by your boss. It may be a waste of time and resources (money, facilities, trainers) if the training program is not applicable to the employee or the field, offered by some third-party organization who doesn't have your goals in mind. Your willingness, competence, and if you are able to tap into your potential are all key factors in the success of any training program. If you are ready, willing, and able, you could be trained in such a way that could make you multi-skilled and ready to take on diverse roles and responsibilities desired of you. However, if you don't take the training to heart, it's likely you'll end up right back at square one. Through training, the gap and shortcomings that have been hindering you from fulfilling your objectives may fade away. This allows you to explore your work world to your full potential. Again, only if you take advantage of it! Training enhances adaptability of the employees by preparing them for any changes in the workplace or in technology. With this training, you may become readily able to accommodate the team, the organization as a whole, and even yourself. Training enables employees to perform better, often resulting in work being more tolerable. This can impact their motivation and job satisfaction because they feel \\"not left out\\" or \\"not left behind.\\" You may also feel taken care of by your organization because they've provided you with a platform to keep yourself updated, prepared for the future, and made valuable. Training is a concrete attempt to retain you and make you a part of the team. When you feel this, you may feel more connected to your work, improving your morale. A workshop is something different than a formal training program, seminar or meeting. It can be used in tandem with training and development programs. It's usually more informal and an ideal platform to introduce the employees to ways to reduce the employee gap. Sometimes, the employees are asked to determine ways they think would help them. In other words, it's more hands-on than training usually is. Workshops are great for soft skills, too, which are just as important. They can even help with relations between clients, customers, peers, and managers. On the other hand, they can also address oral and written communication skills, negotiation skills, and correspondence issues. If your aim is to improve your soft skills, workshops are the way to go. In workshops, the employees get a chance to take ownership of their learning, skills, growth in the organization and acceptance in the organization. Afterward, you emerge feeling like you have a hold on the company's ideas and are part of their vision. Often workshops are used to introduce technologies and trends that the organization would like to adopt. Once you know what technology is to be incorporated, learn it! This can greatly lessen the gap by keeping you up with where the company sees itself going. If you don't know how to learn the technology, odds are you have a wealth of options you haven't even thought about. Would your coworkers be able to help? Could you take a class? What about the Internet? A mentor? If your company doesn't offer training, seek out ways to solve the problem yourself.","completion":"The article discusses the importance of a competency-based performance management system, emphasizing the role of mentors, workplace training, and workshops in helping employees acquire necessary skills, stay updated with changing trends, and align themselves with organizational expectations to minimize performance gaps and achieve professional growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, that was far from the truth. Eriksen has proved his doubters wrong with his string of spectacular performances in the Premier League and Cup competitions alike. His technical ability on the field, his vision and his ability to create chances for his teammates have been a much-needed force for the team, driving them towards greater achievements. Ever since he moved to White Hart Lane, Eriksen has grown in stature, playing a crucial role behind successful campaigns and winning the hearts of the fans. With each passing season, he has shown immense potential as a top-level player, getting closer to emulating the club legends like Gascoigne and Hoddle. His contributions have been remarkable and have helped lift the team to challenge for top spots consistently. His never-say-die attitude and commitment to his craft have made him an indispensable part of the squad, and an inimitable presence on the pitch. Tottenham Hotspur fans have always appreciated cultural icons, and Eriksen, with his unique style of play and skill set, can very well carve his name into the list of all-time Spurs greats. It's important, however, for the club to offer their unwavering support and faith to ensure that Eriksen continues to blossom and reach the pinnacle of his career at Tottenham. With the right guidance and a proactive approach from the management and coaching staff, there's no doubt that Eriksen will play an even more significant role in future accomplishments for the club. In conclusion, Jan Vertonghen's belief in the endless potential of his fellow teammate proves that Eriksen has all the makings of a legend, not only within the ranks of Tottenham Hotspur but also in the pages of football history. Given his current trajectory and upward trend, there's every reason to believe that Christian Eriksen is on the path to becoming a true Spurs icon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The last, and longest, glimpse features a boy who wakes up in a hospital next to several corpses, reading Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (\\"VÃ¥r Tids HjÃ¤lte\\" in the film), and caressing a blurry, transient image that shifts between Elisabet and/or Alma's faces. A young nurse, Alma (portrayed by Bibi Andersson), is summoned by the head doctor and charged with the care of stage actress Elisabet Vogler (portrayed by Liv Ullmann), who has, despite the lack of any diagnosed impairment, become mute. The hospital administrator (portrayed by Margaretha Krook) offers her own seaside cottage as a place for Alma to nurse Elisabet back to health. Though Elisabet is nearly catatonic when the film begins, she does react with extreme panic upon seeing a Vietnamese Buddhist monk's self-immolation on television, and laughs mockingly at Alma's radio soap opera. As the two women leave the hospital together, Alma reads aloud a letter Elisabet's husband has sent her, which includes a photograph of her young son. Together in the administrator's cottage, Elisabet begins to relax, though she remains completely silent and non-responsive. Alma speaks constantly to break the silence, at first about books she is reading and trivial matters, then increasingly about her own anxieties and relationship with her fiancÃ©, Karl-Henrik, who scolds her for lacking ambition â \\"though not with my career, I suppose in some greater way.\\" Alma constantly compares herself to Elisabet and begins to grow attached to her. As the act closes, Alma confesses to cheating on her fiancÃ© in a mÃ©nage Ã quatre with underage boys. She became pregnant, and had Karl-Henrik's friend abort the baby; \\"and...

At the same time rockets were growing larger and larger, till a stage was reached where rockets could be nuclear powered. This lead to the formation of a new agency, the CIFC (Civil Interplanetary Flight Commission)The CIFCs job was to develop newer more efficient rocket motors and alloys to house such motors. Slowly all the obstacles were overcome. Only one factor remained, the human factorWe see an experimental centrifuge designed to test a humans ability to withstand G force acceleration. The experiment is interrupted by Dr Ralph Harrison (Charles Drake) when the potential astronaut passes out The other scientists are frustrated at Harrisons intervention. They were instructed to conduct the tests to the maximum extreme. Harrison goes to the commissioner and hands in his resignation; he declares he wont be party to such unsafe practices.While Harrison is packing to leave Washington he is visited by Prof Nordstrom (Taylor Holmes) he explains he agrees with Harrisons position and is having the same argument with the CIFC Commissioner.

Answer:","completion":"Tobor is a highly advanced robot designed as a solution to overcome the limitations of the human factor in space exploration in the context of the fictitious Civil Interplanetary Flight Commission (CIFC) in the movie titled \\"Tobor the Great.\\" In the movie, as technology progresses, nuclear power plants become small enough to be housed in submarines, while rockets grow larger and more powerful, eventually becoming nuclear-powered. This advancement leads to the formation of the CIFC, an agency responsible for developing more efficient rocket motors and alloys. Dr. Ralph Harrison (Charles Drake), a scientist working on an experimental centrifuge, resigns from his position at the CIFC, due to his disagreement with the extreme nature of the tests being conducted on potential astronauts. He is soon approached by Professor Nordstrom (Taylor Holmes), who has also had disagreements with the CIFC and believes he has a solution to the human factor issue. He recruits Harrison to join him on his project. As they are discussing their project at the airport, a nosy news reporter interrupts their conversation, revealing that Nordstrom's resignation is public knowledge. This sparks concerns about enemy nations learning secrets through news speculation. Upon arriving at a secluded compound with various security measures, Nordstrom introduces Harrison to his daughter Janice (Karin Booth) and grandson Brian \\"Gadge\\" Roberts (Billy Chapin). Karl (Franz Roehn), the professor's assistant, informs them about Brian's father's tragic death during the development of a new alloy. The solution Nordstrom and Harrison are working on is \\"Tobor,\\" an advanced robot that can be controlled remotely or through ESP (Extra-Sensory Perception). The idea is to have Tobor replace human astronauts during space missions, removing the risks and limitations posed by sending humans to space. Tobor has several features that make it the perfect candidate for this purpose. It is built with a sturdy and robust material to withstand the harsh conditions of space, it does not require life-support systems, and it can endure extreme acceleration forces and radiation exposure without any harm. As the movie progresses, espionage and sabotage attempts occur, targeting Tobor and its creators. However, Tobor proves to be an exceptional creation capable of overcoming many challenges posed by the saboteurs and enemy agents. In conclusion, Tobor is an advanced robot designed in response to the limitations of human astronauts, and its purpose is to withstand the challenges of space exploration. The movie \\"Tobor the Great\\" tells the story of the scientists' journey in creating this exceptional invention, navigating through the challenges of espionage and sabotage attempts to make space travel safer and more efficient."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Robert Brydon Jones, MBE (born 3 May 1965), known professionally as Rob Brydon, is a Welsh actor, comedian, radio and television presenter, singer and impressionist. He played Dr Paul Hamilton in the Australian/British comedy series \\"Supernova\\", Bryn West in the sitcom\\" Gavin & Stacey\\" and Keith Barret in the BBC comedy series \\"Marion and Geoff\\" and its spin-off \\"The Keith Barret Show\\". - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Have I Got News for You is a British television panel show produced by Hat Trick Productions for the BBC.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose death at the height of her fame and was a shock to the musical world? is inside the article: Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore.

No; The answer is:","completion":"[2]. It's impossible to say; The Four Cs of 21st-century learning are essential skills that complement traditional skills such as reading, writing, and math, rather than compete with them in importance. They are designed to help students adapt to the ever-changing world and prepare them for future careers that may not yet exist. It is not accurate to say that the 4Cs are more important than reading, writing, and math skills. Instead, it is crucial to view them as a part of a holistic approach to education that values and emphasizes both academic knowledge and soft skills necessary for success in today's world. Critical thinking involves the ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information to make informed decisions, solve problems, and form logical conclusions. It helps students develop the skills to recognize biases, question assumptions, and distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources of information. Communication is the ability to convey information effectively and efficiently to diverse audiences using various methods and media. Good communication skills help students express their ideas, opinions, and feelings clearly and concisely. Students should also develop the ability to listen actively and respond empathetically to others, as well as utilize communication technologies. Collaboration entails working together with others to achieve common goals effectively. Students must learn how to contribute to group projects, share responsibilities, manage conflicts, and build consensus. They should also develop interpersonal skills such as teamwork, leadership, and adaptability that are necessary for working in diverse environments. Creativity is the capacity to generate new ideas, concepts, and solutions to problems, as well as the ability to adapt and apply existing knowledge to novel situations. Fostering creativity in education helps students think outside the box, adapt to new situations, and develop unique approaches to solving problems. While the Four Cs are vital to 21st-century education, it is essential to remember that these skills should not replace traditional reading, writing, and math skills but rather complement them. A well-rounded education should encompass both academic knowledge and the 4Cs to prepare students for success in an increasingly complex and interconnected global society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the set of songs that Alan Gibbs believes is at least equal to Vaughan William's Five English Folk songs of 1913? During and after the composition of The Planets, Holst wrote or arranged numerous vocal and choral works, many of them for the wartime Thaxted Whitsun Festivals, 1916–18. They include the Six Choral Folksongs of 1916, based on West Country tunes, of which \\"Swansea Town\\", with its \\"sophisticated tone\\", is deemed by Dickinson to be the most memorable. Holst downplayed such music as \\"a limited form of art\\" in which \\"mannerisms are almost inevitable\\"; the composer Alan Gibbs, however, believes Holst's set at least equal to Vaughan Williams's Five English Folk Songs of 1913.Holst's first major work after The Planets was the Hymn of Jesus, completed in 1917. The words are from a Gnostic text, the apocryphal Acts of St John, using a translation from the Greek which Holst prepared with assistance from Clifford Bax and Jane Joseph. Head comments on the innovative character of the Hymn: \\"At a stroke Holst had cast aside the Victorian and Edwardian sentimental oratorio, and created the precursor of the kind of works that John Tavener, for example, was to write in the 1970s\\". Matthews has written that the Hymn's \\"ecstatic\\" quality is matched in English music \\"perhaps only by Tippett's The Vision of Saint Augustine\\"; the musical elements include plainsong, two choirs distanced from each other to emphasise dialogue, dance episodes and \\"explosive chordal dislocations\\".In the Ode to Death (1918–19), the quiet, resigned mood is seen by Matthews as an \\"abrupt volte-face\\" after the life-enhancing spirituality of the Hymn. Warrack refers to its aloof tranquillity; Imogen Holst believed the Ode expressed Holst's private attitude to death. The piece has rarely been performed since its premiere in 1922, although the composer Ernest Walker thought it was Holst's finest work to that date.The influential critic Ernest Newman considered The Perfect Fool \\"the best of modern British operas\\", but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature—described by The Times as \\"a brilliant puzzle\\"—put it outside the...

His life takes a dramatic turn when he is faced with a high-stakes military trial that will test his principles and challenge his perception of honor. Plot: Daniel Kaffee (played by an actor like Chris Evans) is a talented but disillusioned lawyer who is tired of living in the shadow of his legendary father. Alongside his best friend and fellow lawyer, Jules (played by an actress like Zoe Kravitz), they are assigned to a high-profile military trial that captures the nation's attention. The case: a decorated war hero named Captain Miller (played by an actor like Tom Hanks) has been accused of war crimes during a top-secret military mission. The situation is complicated when it's revealed that Miller had removed the arm patch representing honor from his uniform right before the alleged incident, stating that he no longer believed in the empty symbolism of the patch. As Kaffee and Jules investigate the case, they uncover a web of conspiracy and corruption within the military's highest ranks. Captain Miller had discovered the illicit activities and made himself a target by trying to expose the truth. As the trial progresses, the phrase \\"Who says that they don't need a patch on their arm to have honor?\\" becomes Kaffee's powerful mantra. It serves as a reminder that true honor comes from one's actions and convictions, rather than mere symbols. The climax of the movie sees Kaffee deliver a passionate, stirring closing argument, winning the jury's favor and securing Captain Miller's acquittal. In the end, Kaffee learns the true meaning of honor and integrity, simultaneously earning the respect of his peers and breaking free from the shadow of his father.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which age group is smaller: under the age of 18 or 18 to 24?","completion":"Title: Comparing Age Demographics: Under 18 vs. 18 to 24 Introduction A common question arising in discussions of population demographics concerns the size of various age groups in society. In this article, we will tackle one such query: which age group is smaller - those under the age of 18 or those in the 18 to 24 age bracket? To address this question, we will examine global demographic data, assess factors contributing to these population figures, and discuss the potential implications of the smaller age group in society. Analysis of Global Demographic Data To start, let us look into global demographic information. According to the World Population Review, there are approximately 7.9 billion people on Earth as of 2021. The United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs reports that there are roughly 2.3 billion children aged 0-18, accounting for nearly 29.11% of the global population. Comparatively, young adults aged 18 to 24 years total around 1.19 billion – approximately 15.06% of the global population. Comparing these figures, we can determine that people under the age of 18 represent a considerably larger proportion of the population compared to those aged 18 to 24. Therefore, the age group consisting of individuals aged 18 to 24 years is the smaller demographic in question. Factors Influencing Age Group Sizes Now that we have answered the question at hand, it is important to consider the factors that contribute to these differing population sizes for individuals under 18 compared to those aged 18 to 24. The following factors play a major role in determining the size of these age groups: 1. Birth rates: A higher birth rate results in a more significant number of children under the age of 18. Over the past decades, birth rates in many countries have been on the decline, leading to smaller populations of children relative to young adults. 2. Mortality rates: Higher mortality rates among children due to diseases, malnutrition, or other causes can impact the population size in the under-18 age group. Efforts to alleviate these issues have been made on a global level, which led to an overall improvement in child survival rates. 3. Socioeconomic factors: Changes in social norms, such as increasing the age at which individuals tend to start families, can influence the size of the under-18 age group. Additionally, socioeconomic development often correlates with lower birth rates over time. Implications of the Smaller Age Group Understanding the differences in sizes between the under-18 and 18-24 age groups is essential as it helps inform policy, education, and social frameworks tailored to address the diverse needs of these populations. Some implications of the smaller 18 to 24 age group include: 1. Education and workforce: A smaller population of young adults entering the workforce and higher education systems may impact the availability of relevant opportunities for career and educational growth. 2. Social structures: Different age group sizes can alter the balance of social systems and support networks, as well as influence changes in cultural norms and values. 3. Economic implications: A smaller 18-24 age group can have a significant impact on the housing market, consumer behavior, and overall economic growth, given that these young adults are often starting their careers and transitioning to independent living. Conclusion Through analyzing global demographic data, it is evident that the age group of individuals aged 18 to 24 is smaller than that of people under 18. Factors such as birth rates, mortality rates, and socioeconomic changes contribute to the sizes of these two age groups. Recognizing these distinct population demographics is essential in ensuring that appropriate policies and support structures are implemented to address the unique needs of both groups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:WHITE HOUSE — A controversial clothing choice is overshadowing a surprise visit by U.S. first lady Melania Trump to a Texas facility to meet immigrant children separated from their families because of her husband's \\"zero-tolerance\\" immigration policy. Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket.

The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer.

A rare, salamander-like amphibian has been spotted in its only known natural habitat, after researchers feared the creature had disappeared from the wild. Mexican biologists have seen, but not caught, two axolotls during a second attempt to find them in the Xochimilco network of lakes and canals of Mexico City. The researchers took to the muddy waters of lake Xochimilco in small boats last year, and searched for weeks for the amphibian, but to no avail. But biologist Armando Tovar Garza, of Mexico's National Autonomous University, said that members of the team carrying out the search had seen two axolotls during the first three weeks of a second survey expected to conclude in April. “We weren't able to capture them...because the behaviour of the axolotl makes them very difficult to capture,” he said. “But we have had two sightings. That's important, because it tells us we still have a chance.” Local residents and scientists of the Biology Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico look for insects, which are food for the axolotls. The axolotl has a slimy tail, plumage-like gills and mouth that curls into an odd smile, and is known as the “water monster” or the “Mexican walking fish” Growing up to a foot long, axolotls use four stubby legs to drag themselves along the bottom or thick tails to swim in Xochimilco's murky channels while feeding on aquatic insects, small fish and crustaceans. It is regarded as important in scientific research because of its ability to regenerate severed limbs. Some axolotls still survive in aquariums, water tanks and research labs, but experts said those conditions are not the best, because of interbreeding and other risks. Releasing captive-bred axolotls into the wild is not an option as it could spread a fatal fungus and reduce their genetic diversity. The “floating gardens” of earth piled on reed mats that the Aztecs built to grow crops where axolotols live in the wild, are now suffering from pollution, urban sprawl and invasive species. Mr Tovar Garza said some small mutations, possibly the result of interbreeding, have already been seen. Alarmed by the creature's falling numbers in recent years, researchers built axolotl “shelters” in Xochimilco to help them breed in the cleanest part of their remaining habitat. Sacks of rocks and reedy plants act as filters around a selected area, and cleaner water is pumped in, to create better conditions. A young axolotl swims inside a plastic container at an experimental canal run by Mexico's National Autonomous University The Mexican Academy of Sciences said a 1998 survey found an average of 6,000 axolotls per square kilometre, a figure that dropped to 1,000 in a 2003 study and 100 in 2008.

(Associated Press) Researchers say they have sighted, but not caught, two of the slippery little creatures during a second effort to find them. A weekslong effort last year by researchers in skiffs trying to net axolotls in the shallow, muddy waters of Xochimilco lake found none, raising fears that they might only now survive in captivity. But biologist Armando Tovar Garza of Mexico's National Autonomous University said Friday that members of the team carrying out the search had seen two axolotls during the first three weeks of a second survey expected to conclude in April. \\"We weren't able to capture them ... because the behavior of the axolotl makes them very difficult to capture,\\" Tovar Garza said. \\"We haven't had any captures, but we have had two sightings. That's important, because it tells us we still have a chance.\\" The axolotl, admittedly ugly with a slimy tail, plumage-like gills and mouth that curls into an odd smile, is known as the \\"water monster\\" and the \\"Mexican walking fish.\\" It's only natural habitat is the Xochimilco network of lakes and canals — the \\"floating gardens\\" of earth piled on reed mats that the Aztecs built to grow crops but are now suffering from pollution, urban sprawl and invasive species. The creature is import in scientific research because of its ability to regenerate severed limbs. Some axolotls still survive in aquariums, water tanks and research labs, but experts said those conditions aren't the best, because of interbreeding and other risks. Releasing captive-bred axolotls into the wild could spread a fungus infection that is fatal to them and could reduce their genetic diversity. Tovar Garza said some small mutations, possibly the result of interbreeding, have already been seen. Alarmed by the creature's falling numbers in recent years, researchers built axolotl \\"shelters\\" in Xochimilco to help them breed in the cleanest part of their remaining habitat. Sacks of rocks and reedy plants act as filters around a selected area, and cleaner water is pumped in, to create better conditions. The shelters also include permeable cages and other devices intended to help protect axolotls from non-native carp and tilapia that were introduced to the lake system years ago and compete with axolotls for food. Growing up to a foot long (30 centimeters), axolotls use four stubby legs to drag themselves along the bottom or thick tails to swim in Xochimilco's murky channels while feeding on aquatic insects, small fish and crustaceans. But the surrounding garden-islands have increasingly been converted to illicit shantytowns, with untreated sewage often running off into the water. The Mexican Academy of Sciences said in a statement that a 1998 survey found an average of 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer, a figure that dropped to 1,000 in a 2003 study and 100 in a 2008 survey. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Mexican biologists have spotted two axolotls, a rare salamander-like amphibian, in the Xochimilco network of lakes and canals of Mexico City.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The Committee recommends that the State party revise any provision of federal law or the law of certain states that allows for non-therapeutic experiments to be conducted on minors or mentally ill individuals with only the consent of the guardianship authority. This long and detailed explanation seeks to translate and provide additional context to the given statement in French: The statement pertains to a recommendation made by a Committee (possibly a human rights or medical ethics committee) to a State party (a country that is a member or signatory to an agreement or convention) to review and potentially amend certain legal provisions. These provisions, as per the statement, are found in the federal law or law of specific states within the country. They allow for non-therapeutic experiments to be carried out on minors (those under the legal age of adulthood) or individuals suffering from mental disorders. Non-therapeutic experiments refer to those that do not have any direct medical benefit or treatment purpose for the subjects participating in them. Such experiments may be research-based or aimed at understanding a condition, but they do not necessarily alleviate the subject's health issues. The statement highlights concerns regarding the consent process for such experiments. As it stands, these legal provisions permit experiments to be conducted with only the consent of the guardianship authority. The guardianship authority could be the legal guardian or custodian of the minor or mentally ill individual. The Committee's recommendation must have stemmed from the belief that this consent process is insufficient or not robust enough to protect the rights and well-being of vulnerable individuals involved in non-therapeutic experiments. In conclusion, the statement underscores the need for the State party to review and possibly revise its legal provisions to ensure the rights of minors and mentally ill individuals are better protected in the context of non-therapeutic experiments. This revision should take into account the consent requirements for including vulnerable populations in experiments, making certain that their best interests are kept at the forefront."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: Are You Experienced was an immediate commercial success, selling more than one million copies within seven months of its release. Reviewing the album in 1967, Melody Maker praised its artistic integrity and the Experience's varied use of tempo. NME's Keith Altham said it is \\"a brave effort by Hendrix to produce a musical form which is original and exciting\\". However, not all contemporary writers gave the LP a favorable review; in November 1967, Rolling Stone's Jon Landau wrote that although he considered Hendrix a \\"great guitarist and a brilliant arranger\\", he disapproved of his singing and songwriting. He criticized the quality of the material and described the lyrics as inane: \\"Above all this record is unrelentingly violent, and lyrically, inartistically violent at that.\\"Many music critics have since named Are You Experienced as one of the greatest rock and roll debut albums. Journalist Ritchie Unterberger described it as \\"one of the definitive albums of the psychedelic era.\\" Author Chris Smith said the release was \\"a landmark in a summer of landmark albums\\". Noe Goldwasser, the founding editor of Guitar World magazine, called it \\"a veritable textbook of what a musician can do with his instrument\\" and \\"the measure by which everything ... in rock and roll has been compared since.\\" According to music journalist Charles Shaar Murray, the album \\"completely changed notions of what a guitar could sound like, or indeed, what music could sound like\\", while The Miami Herald credited Are You Experienced with introducing acid rock, classic rock, and the guitar aesthetic of heavy metal. Critic Robert Christgau called it a \\"bombshell debut\\" in his review for Blender and said its songs were innovative for how they utilized three-minute pop structures as a medium for Hendrix's unprecedentedly heavy and turbulent guitar and loud, powerful hooks, which greatly appealed to young listeners.Rolling Stone includes the album and several songs on various \\"best of\\" lists, such as: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time – No. 15, calling...

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Whose history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology? , can you please find it? The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical... The answer is:","completion":"Etty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"To consider the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"I want for nobody to hate me,\\" step-by-step, I will analyze its syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 1. Syntax: The sentence is grammatically correct, as it follows the basic structure of a subject (I) followed by a verb (want) and a complement (for nobody to hate me). However, the preposition \\"for\\" might be considered redundant or informal—most native speakers would likely say \\"I want nobody to hate me.\\" 2. Semantics: The sentence conveys a clear meaning—the speaker wishes that no one feels hatred toward them. The words used in the sentence (want, nobody, hate, me) all have well-defined meanings that contribute to the sentence's overall coherence. 3. Pragmatics: Understanding the speaker's intentions and the context in which this sentence might be used could provide further insight into its linguistic integrity. It seems that the speaker desires universal acceptance and wishes to avoid any negative feelings others may have towards them. In conclusion, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"I want for nobody to hate me\\" is generally good. The syntax is understandable, the semantics are clear, and the pragmatics are easily inferred from the sentence itself. The use of \\"for\\" may be seen as redundant or informal, but it does not significantly impact the sentence's integrity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

And that led it to be adopted by a much larger tribe--the business tribe. You cannot wear a tie if you work with machinery. So wearing a tie became a sign that you were a man who used your brain to make a living, rather than your hands. It showed you were serious. It showed you were a professional. It meant that everyone who wanted a job in business had to wear one. It was just impossible to take seriously a man who didn't wear a piece of color1ed silk around his neck. This is how millions of people came to be wearing ties across the world. They are part of the uniform of business. \\"Ties offer a point of indifference,\\" says John Milne, head of the British Guide of Tie Makers. \\"They give a chance to say something about their own personality.\\" So if you happen to meet a man with a very brightly color1ed tie, there is a good chance that he is the office joker. There is also a good chance that he will be wearing brightly color1ed socks. Is there a future for ties? The signs are not promising. Tie wearing seems to be rare among the new bread of entrepreneurs in the Internet and new technology industries. Many political leaders,including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, now go without ties. This shows they are men of the people--but not the people wearing ties. Up until around 1960, it was common for men across the Western world to wear hats as part of their business uniform. That changed with the election of John F. Kennedy to the presidency of the United States. Kennedy never wore a hat in fact his nickname was\\"hatless Jack\\". Seeing that the most powerful man in the world did not have to wear a hat, millions of other men decided that they did not have to, either. Hats simply vanished across the Western world. Perhaps\\"tieless Tony\\"(UK Prime Minister Tony Blair) will have the same effect as \\"hatless Jack\\".

Fact 2: People with healthy immune systems usually get well on their own. Given the two facts above, what does immunodeficiency do? Answer:","completion":"Immunodeficiency is a condition where the immune system does not function adequately, leading to a compromised or weakened ability to fight off infections and diseases. Given the two facts mentioned: 1. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is not working properly. This means that people with immunodeficiency have a reduced ability to resist and combat infections, pathogens, or other foreign substances that enter the body. Their immune system may not respond effectively, or it may fail to initiate an immune response at all. This can be caused by genetic factors, acquired conditions, or environmental factors that impact the immune system's development and function. 2. People with healthy immune systems usually get well on their own. In contrast, people with a healthy immune system have the capability to ward off infections, diseases, and other threats to their well-being. Their immune system is strong enough to detect and eliminate pathogens, initiate the healing process, and build immunity to future threats. Given these two facts, immunodeficiency affects people's ability to recover from infections and diseases on their own. In individuals with immunodeficiency, the weakened immune system struggles to protect and defend the body against harmful invaders effectively. As a result, people with immunodeficiency are more susceptible to recurrent or severe infections, have a higher risk of complications, and may take longer to recover from illnesses compared to individuals with a healthy immune system. In some cases, they may require additional medical intervention, treatments, or therapies to manage their condition and reduce the impact of infections on their overall health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: Go online and take notes on information about how to protect yourself from scams and identity theft. This information will be essential when it comes time to discuss the possibility of getting a Facebook account. Look for apps and firewall software that will monitor risky activity on your computer to prevent viruses and malware. Your parents may want additional protection if they agree to let you use social media. You have to be at least 13 years old to create a Facebook Account. This limit may be different in certain countries. Before you talk to your parents about getting a Facebook account, jot down all of the reasons that you want to make a profile on a piece of paper. Consider which reasons your parents are likely to agree with, and focus on those. Write out a few points that you can make when talking to your parents. “Because it’s fun” or “I want one” are not good reasons for getting a profile. Think about the features that you plan on using and focus on those. “I need a Facebook account to remember birthdays,” “I want to talk to my friends outside of school,” and “I can be invited to important events” are all valid reasons for wanting a Facebook profile. Facebook may have a reputation as a waste of time, but there are plenty of valid reasons to get a Facebook page. When building an argument, focus on how easy Facebook makes it easy to talk to people that you would otherwise lose touch with. If you have family members on Facebook, say that you want to get closer to them. If you’re almost at the age where you can get a job, point out that Facebook is an excellent way to network and learn about new opportunities. Your parents may not know that Facebook is used as a networking site. Find a public Facebook group that focuses on job hunting. Show it to them, and explain that Facebook can serve as a positive tool if you use it correctly. before presenting your argument. One of the worst things that you can do is get up in front of your parents without having practiced your speech. Once you’ve identified some reasons that you should have a Facebook, practice explaining them out loud in your room. Look at yourself in a mirror as you speak to see how your body language is influencing your argument. Practicing your presentation is a good way to figure out which arguments you feel confident about, which can give you a clue about where to start your speech. Your parents are likely going to raise concerns about your privacy and safety when you’re online. To respond to this counterargument, explain to them that you can block strangers on Facebook. You can also change your privacy settings to keep people from finding you in searches. Your parents may not know about the privacy features on Facebook. Don’t assume that they know how to change them, even if they have profiles themselves. Summary:","completion":"To protect oneself from scams and identity theft, it is important to research apps, firewall software, and practices to prevent viruses and malware. Before discussing getting a Facebook account with parents, one should write down valid reasons for wanting a profile, focusing on features and benefits such as remembering birthdays, communication, and event invitations.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who resented the marriage? from the following article ? Ottavio's marriage troubled Alessandro; he struggled with the burden of chastity and entertained fantasies of marrying a princess. He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he \\"became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor.\\" In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given as a means to strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost. His success bred resentment amongst his family, as he began to see himself unaccountable to Rome.At the time of the portrait Paul had convinced Alessandro to retain the post, hinting that he would later succeed him as pope – an aspiration that was ultimately...

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores","completion":"The phrase \\"has created a provocative, absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores\\" can be considered both positive and negative depending on the context, intent, and perspective from which it is being viewed. Let's look at the different parts of the phrase to break it down: 1. \\"Created a provocative, absorbing drama\\": This part of the phrase is primarily positive. It praises the work being described as thought-provoking and engaging. It suggests that the creator managed to craft something that elicits intellectual or emotional responses and holds the audience's attention. In this context, it serves as a compliment. 2. \\"Reveals the curse of a self-hatred\\": This part of the phrase indicates a negative subject matter or theme being presented in the drama. The phrase describes the \\"curse\\" or detrimental effect associated with self-hatred. Although the content discussed may be somber or disturbing, it is not necessarily a negative assessment of the work itself. It merely highlights that the drama explores these darker aspects of the human experience. 3. \\"Instilled by rigid social mores\\": This part of the phrase offers insight into the source or cause behind the self-hatred depicted in the drama. It points to inflexible social norms that contribute to the feeling of self-hatred experienced by the characters. It serves as a social critique, showcasing how societal expectations and rules can negatively impact individuals. Taking all parts of the phrase into account, it is evident that it provides a comprehensive assessment of the drama being discussed. Although certain elements of the phrase focus on negative subject matters or themes, the overall evaluation of the work is positive. The phrase commends the creator for successfully producing a captivating and evocative drama, while also shedding light on the darker side of the human psyche caused by constrictive social mores. In essence, the phrase's positive aspect lies in how the drama is able to captivate and provoke audiences, while the negative aspect pertains to the subject matter being explored within the drama. Ultimately, it can be inferred that the phrase demonstrates appreciation for the creator's ability to address serious and somber themes effectively, thus allowing for a more profound understanding of human emotions and societal impacts."},{"prompt":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

In 1483, a conspiracy arose among a number of disaffected gentry, many of whom had been supporters of Edward IV and the \\"whole Yorkist establishment\\". The conspiracy was nominally led by Richard's former ally and first cousin once removed Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, although it had begun as a Woodville-Beaufort conspiracy (being \\"well under way\\" by the time of the duke's involvement). Indeed, Davies has suggested that it was \\"only the subsequent parliamentary attainder that placed Buckingham at the centre of events\\", in order to blame a single disaffected magnate motivated by greed, rather than \\"the embarrassing truth\\" that those opposing Richard were actually \\"overwhelmingly Edwardian loyalists\\". It is possible that they planned to depose Richard III and place Edward V back on the throne, and that when rumours arose that Edward and his brother were dead, Buckingham proposed that Henry Tudor should return from exile, take the throne and marry Elizabeth of York, elder sister of the Tower Princes. However, it has also been pointed out that as this narrative stems from Richard's own parliament of 1484, it should probably be treated \\"with caution\\". For his part, Buckingham raised a substantial force from his estates in Wales and the Marches. Henry, in exile in Brittany, enjoyed the support of the Breton treasurer Pierre Landais, who hoped Buckingham's victory would cement an alliance between Brittany and England. Some of Henry Tudor's ships ran into a storm and were forced to return to Brittany or Normandy, while Henry himself anchored off Plymouth for a week before learning of Buckingham's failure. Buckingham's army was troubled by the same storm and deserted when Richard's forces came against them. Buckingham tried to escape in disguise, but was either turned in by a retainer for the bounty Richard had put on his head, or was discovered in hiding with him. He was convicted of treason and beheaded in Salisbury, near the Bull's Head Inn, on 2 November. His widow, Catherine Woodville, later married Jasper Tudor, the uncle of Henry Tudor, who was in the process of organising another rebellion. Richard made overtures to Landais, offering military support for Landais's weak regime under Duke Francis II of Brittany in exchange for Henry. Henry fled to Paris, where he secured support from the French regent Anne of Beaujeu, who supplied troops for an invasion in 1485. The French government, recalling Richard's effective disowning of the Treaty of Picquigny and refusal to accept the accompanying French pension, would not have welcomed the accession of one known to be unfriendly to France.

[I] no; [II] yes;","completion":"[I] no Sickle cell anemia, also known as sickle cell disease, is a genetic disorder affecting the shape and functionality of red blood cells. The origin of sickle cell anemia can be traced back to a genetic mutation in the HBB gene, which codes for the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein responsible for transporting oxygen in the blood. The HBB gene mutation responsible for sickle cell anemia occurred thousands of years ago in parts of Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Arabian Peninsula. The mutation provided a selective advantage in areas where malaria was prevalent because individuals with one copy of the mutated gene (heterozygous) were less likely to suffer severe complications from the disease. This heterozygous advantage meant that the mutated gene was passed down through generations and spread throughout the populations in those regions. Historically, malaria was a significant cause of death in these regions, and the partial protection against it provided by the sickle cell trait gave carriers a survival advantage. As a result, the genetic mutation persisted even though it can cause sickle cell anemia in individuals who inherit two copies of the mutated gene. Over time, the spread of populations and migration led to the distribution of the sickle cell trait to various parts of the world. Sickle cell anemia is transferred from one generation to another through autosomal recessive inheritance. Each individual has two copies of the HBB gene – one from each parent. If both parents are carriers of the mutated HBB gene, there is a 25% chance that their children will inherit two copies of the mutation, resulting in sickle cell anemia. In contrast, there is a 50% chance the child will inherit one copy of the mutation and one normal gene, making them a carrier, and a 25% chance that they will inherit two normal genes, resulting in no sickle cell trait. The questions are not the same as the first one asks about the origin of sickle cell anemia, while the second question focuses on its mode of transmission through generations. Understanding the origin of the disease helps us trace its historical background and evolutionary context, while knowing how it is transferred gives us insight into the genetics and inheritance patterns of sickle cell anemia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\"). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history.

Lovering moved from band to band, drumming with Tanya Donelly's group on 1997's Lovesongs for Underdogs and with Boston band Eeenie Meenie. After facing difficulty finding new work, Lovering gave up the drums and moved into a rented house that banned drumming.Towards the end of the 1990s, Lovering's friend Grant-Lee Phillips took him to a magic convention. Lovering was very impressed by some of the illusions, and later said \\"I had to learn how to do it\\". Mutual friend Carl Grasso invited them to a show at the Magic Castle, a magic-oriented nightclub in Los Angeles. There Lovering met Possum Dixon frontman Rob Zabrecky, and the pair soon became friends. Zabrecky convinced Lovering to apply for a performers' membership to the Magic Castle. After gaining his membership, Lovering reinvented himself as \\"The Scientific Phenomenalist\\". His act combined his electrical engineering knowledge with his stage performance experience.

Cardinals answer cardinals, and song sparrows answer song sparrows. A cardinal knows that a song sparrow will not try to steal its mate. So you can see one reason why a cardinal may chase away another cardinal but will not bother a song sparrow. Most different kinds of birds eat different things. To find enough to eat, a bird needs a big piece of land to search in. Many kinds of birds have some ways of dividing up the land into territories. Song sparrows, cardinals ovenbirds, and white-throated sparrows are some of the birds that have territorial systems. Especially in early spring, birds work out the boundaries between their territories by singing \\"keep out\\" threats and by chasing and fighting each other. The birds continue singing to tell females that they have set up territories. Neighboring birds seem to agree that there are make believe fences between their pieces of property. Then they do not have to waste energy chasing each other instead of taking care of their young. Scientists guessed that some birds could recognize their neighbors by small differences in their songs. Two scientists who studied white-throated sparrows found that these birds can even tell the difference between songs of individual birds of their own kind. White-throated sparrows... Question: What is the article mainly about? Yes or no, is the answer \\"How birds sing to communicate.\\"? Answer:","completion":"The article is mainly about how birds, particularly male birds, use their songs to communicate messages, such as claiming their territory, attracting a mate, and warning other birds to stay away. The article also touches upon the concept of territorial systems and how birds recognize each other's songs. So, yes, the answer can be summarized as \\"How birds sing to communicate.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Louis Leo Holtz (born January 6, 1937) is a former American football player, coach, and analyst. He served as the head football coach at The College of William & Mary (1969-1971), North Carolina State University (1972-1975), the New York Jets (1976), the University of Arkansas (1977-1983), the University of Minnesota (1984-1985), the University of Notre Dame (1986-1996), and the University of South Carolina (1999-2004), compiling a career record of 249-132-7. Holtz's 1988 Notre Dame team went 12-0 with a victory in the Fiesta Bowl and was the consensus national champion. Holtz is the only college football coach to lead six different programs to bowl games and the only coach to guide four different programs to the final top 20 rankings. After two seasons as a commentator for CBS Sports, Holtz came out of retirement in 1999 and returned to the University of South Carolina, where he had been an assistant in the 1960s. The year before Holtz arrived, the Gamecocks went 1-10, and the team subsequently went 0-11 during Holtz's first season. In his second season, South Carolina went 8-4, winning the Outback Bowl over the heavily favored Ohio State Buckeyes. The eight-game improvement from the previous year was the best in the nation in 2000 and the third best single-season turnaround in NCAA history. It also earned National Coach of the Year honors for Holtz from Football News and American Football Coaches Quarterly. In his third season, Holtz's success continued, leading the Gamecocks to a 9-3 record and another Outback Bowl victory over Ohio State. The nine wins for the season were the second highest total in the history of the program. Under Holtz's leadership, the Gamecocks posted their best two-year mark in school history from 2000 to 2001, going 17-7 overall and 10-6 in SEC play. After consecutive 5-7 campaigns in 2002 and 2003, Holtz finished his South Carolina tenure on a winning note with a 6-5 record in 2004. Holtz's time in Columbia saw the resurrection of Gamecock Football, as the program had only one bowl win and no Top 25 finishes in the ten years before his hire. Upon his exit, USC had posted AP Top 25 finishes in 2000 and 2001 (#19 and No. 13 respectively) and had made consecutive New Year's Day bowls for the first time in its history. Holtz finished his six-year tenure at South Carolina with a 2-4 record versus his former team, Arkansas, beating the Razorbacks in Columbia, SC in 2000 and 2004. In 2005, the NCAA imposed three years probation and reductions in two scholarships on the program for ten admitted violations under Holtz, five of which were found to be major. The violations involved improper tutoring and off-season workouts, as well as a lack of institutional control. No games were forfeited, and no television or postseason ban was imposed. Holtz issued a statement after the sanctions were announced stating, \\"There was no money involved. No athletes were paid. There were no recruiting inducements. No cars. No jobs offered. No ticket scandal.\\" What were the violations for?","completion":"The violations were for improper tutoring and off-season workouts, as well as a lack of institutional control.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I picked up this Sporf in Amsterdam Schipol airport. A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Not only will these conversations help expand your knowledge about ongoing issues, but they'll also create a ripple effect, spreading awareness and motivating action in your community. Step 2: Contact Your Elected Officials Elected officials are the individuals entrusted with representing their constituents. By contacting them, you can share your concerns and provide input on policy-making. Here's how to effectively engage with your elected officials: - Identify your local, state, and national representatives; - Research their voting records and focus areas; - Craft a clear and concise message detailing your concerns or support; - Use different channels to reach out, such as emails, phone calls, and social media; and - Be respectful and professional, regardless of your personal opinions. Regular contact with your elected officials is important because it allows your voice to be heard and contributes to democratic accountability. Step 3: Join the Divestment Movement Finally, consider joining the divestment movement to show your support for a sustainable, equitable future. Divestment is the act of removing investments from organizations that contribute to social, environmental, and ethical issues. These may include fossil fuel industries, tobacco companies, or manufacturers of controversial weapons. Here's how to become part of the divestment movement: - Educate yourself about the different causes, ethical investments, and ongoing campaigns; - Identify where your personal, pension, or institutional investments lie; - Reach out to organizations, community groups, and networks advocating for divestment; - Attend divestment events, demonstrations, and workshops; and - Share your experiences and knowledge with others, fostering change within your spheres of influence. Joining the divestment movement amplifies your impact and demonstrates to the global community that people are demanding change. Conclusion The power of unity in creating change is immense, and even small, individual actions can significantly contribute to affecting positive change. By talking to your friends and neighbors, reaching out to elected officials, and supporting the divestment movement, you're not only taking a stand but also motivating others to join you. The more we collaborate, communicate, and act in solidarity, the closer we come to achieving a fair, just, and sustainable world for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Met believes it will face cuts of up to Â£1bn when a spending review looking at funding levels beyond 2015/16 is announced on 25 November. The Home Office said forces would still have the resources to do their work. London mayor Boris Johnson said policing in the capital would not see cuts \\"anything like the order\\" of those suggested by Britain's most senior officer. He said while Mr Hogan-Howe's comments were \\"sensible\\", he did not think the cuts will be so severe. Mike Penning, minister for policing, crime, criminal justice and victims, said no final decisions had been made. However, he said how officers were deployed was what was important, \\"not how many of them there are in total.\\" But, Sir Bernard said as London was expected to grow by one million people over the next 10 to 15 years, cuts would make the police's job much more difficult. \\"We are going to see less visibility, we will see less patrolling, and we'll be slower to respond because there will be fewer of us\\", he said. Mr Johnson said he had kept police numbers high during his eight-year tenure despite cuts across the country. \\"It is up to us to make the case for London and that's what we are going to do in the course of the next few weeks. \\"But the case has always been very strong, which is that London's population is growing,\\" he added. Stephen Greenhalgh, deputy mayor for policing and crime in London, said he was \\"extremely concerned\\" by the potential cuts that he said he would fight \\"tooth and nail\\". He blamed the formula used to calculate how policing budgets are allocated across the country, describing it as \\"ill-conceived and poorly thought through\\". However, some groups believe savings could be made by reducing frontline officers because new types of crime had meant policing had changed. Andrew Haldenby, director of the think tank Reform, said forces required a better mix of employees with fewer \\"traditional police officers\\". \\"We need more different kinds of police employees, for example doing cyber crime and domestic violence,\\" he said.","completion":"Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe warns that cutting £1 billion from the policing budget would make it harder for the police force to respond quickly and to keep London safe as the population grows."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

A: Pick your answer from: [-] warning howls [-] ejected quills [-] sweet odor [-] foul smell Answer:","completion":"When skunks are in danger, they give off a foul smell. This pungent odor serves as a defense mechanism to deter predators and protect the skunk from harm. Skunks possess specialized glands called anal glands, which produce a highly unpleasant liquid that contains sulfur compounds, such as thiols and thioacetates. These compounds are responsible for the strong, penetrating smell that is difficult to ignore and can linger for days. When a skunk senses danger, it will often raise its tail and display a warning posture to communicate its intention to spray if the threat continues. If the warning is not heeded, the skunk can forcefully eject this noxious substance from its anal glands, aiming it accurately toward the attacker's face. This foul-smelling liquid can cause temporary blindness and severe irritation in the eyes and nasal passages of the affected animal, giving the skunk a chance to escape. It is important to note that using this defense mechanism is not the skunk's first choice, as the process of replenishing their spray can take up to 10 days, during which they are more vulnerable to predators. Skunks are also capable of controlling the amount of spray released, preserving their limited supply for future encounters if needed. In summary, when skunks are in danger, they release a foul smell from their anal glands that serves as a powerful defense mechanism against predators. This highly effective deterrent allows skunks to protect themselves in the wild and maintain their status as a species known for their unique and formidable defenses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a soluble pattern recognition receptor which is classified as a long-pentraxin in the pentraxin family. It is known to play an important role in innate immunity, inflammatory regulation, and female fertility. PTX3 is synthesized by specific cells, primarily in response to inflammatory signals. Among these various cells, neutrophils have a unique PTX3 production system. Neutrophils store PTX3 in neutrophil-specific granules and then the stored PTX3 is released and localizes in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Although certain NET components have been identified, such as histones and anti-microbial proteins, the detailed mechanisms by which NETs localize, as well as capture and kill microbes, have not been fully elucidated. PTX3 is a candidate diagnostic marker of infection and vascular damage. In severe infectious diseases such as sepsis, the circulating PTX3 concentration increases greatly (up to 100 ng/mL, i.e., up to 100-fold of the normal level). Even though it is clearly implied that PTX3 plays a protective role in sepsis and certain other disorders, the detailed mechanisms by which it does so remain unclear. A proteomic study of PTX3 ligands in septic patients revealed that PTX3 forms a complex with certain NET component proteins. This suggests a role for PTX3 in which it facilitates the efficiency of anti-microbial protein pathogen clearance by interacting with both pathogens and anti-microbial proteins. We discuss the possible relationships between PTX3 and NET component proteins in the host protection afforded by the innate immune response. The PTX3 complex has the potential to be a highly useful diagnostic marker of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases.

That's where they were slain, ambush-style -- Saturday afternoon as they sat in their patrol car, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton said at an evening news conference. The gunman approached the passenger side of the patrol car and took a shooting stance, witnesses told police. He opened fire several times, striking both officers in the head, Bratton said. They were \\"shot and killed with no warning, no provocation,\\" Bratton told reporters. \\"They were quite simply, assassinated.\\" The gunman was found dead in a nearby subway station from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Ramos had just turned 40 this month; Liu got married two months ago. Both dreamed of being police officers, Bratton said. \\"One of the unfortunate realities of policing is that you put that blue uniform on and you become part of the thin blue line between us and anarchy,\\" Bratton said. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Bratton met with the families of the victims.

Police identified the shooter as Ismaaiyl Brinsley. He arrived in New York from Baltimore, but had a residence in Atlanta. Bratton said that Brinsley was somehow connected to Brooklyn, but would not discuss that information. Bratton said at this time, there was no indication Brinsley was connected to any terrorist groups or organized entity. Police were investigating posts Brinsley allegedly made on social media. Bratton said that the suspect had earlier shot and seriously wounded a woman believed to be his ex-girlfriend in Baltimore. Baltimore police received information that Brinsley had made threatening comments about police, and sent a warning to police in New York, Bratton said.

Question: What is the name of the band that has received six APRA Awards ? Answer the above question based on the context below: In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony. Answer:","completion":"The name of the band that has received six APRA Awards is Silverchair. This Australian rock band, consisting of members Daniel Johns, Ben Gillies, and Chris Joannou, has achieved significant success and recognition throughout their career.

Daniel Johns serves as the primary songwriter for the band, and while the other members may not have significant influence on the writing itself, they are crucial to the overall sound of the group. With hit songs like \\"Straight Lines\\" co-written by Johns and Hamilton, the band has been able to garner awards and accolades, including their six APRA Awards.

To provide a better answer for the question, let's delve into the history and organization of the Watch Tower Society, focusing on the reporting instructions given to its members. The Watch Tower Society, now known as Jehovah's Witnesses, was formed by Charles Taze Russell in the late 19th century. This religious organization has its headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, and is known for its extensive door-to-door ministry and strict organizational structure. During the tenure of Judge Rutherford, the second president of the Watch Tower Society, there were significant changes in the organization's policies, doctrines, and practices. Some of these changes included a centralized hierarchical system, and an increased emphasis on organization and reporting. This period saw the introduction of weekly reporting, wherein all congregation members were instructed to report their preaching and evangelizing activities weekly to the Brooklyn headquarters. The weekly report typically included the following activities: 1. Hours spent in public preaching and door-to-door ministry. 2. Number of pieces of literature, including books, magazines, and tracts, distributed. 3. Amount of time spent in conducting Bible studies with individuals and families. 4. Any other relevant information related to their evangelizing efforts, such as special events or campaigns. The purpose of these weekly reports was to provide the organization with a comprehensive view of the preaching work being done around the world. The reports would help the leadership to assess the growth of the organization, allocate resources more efficiently, and devise strategies for further outreach efforts. It is noteworthy that during Rutherford's leadership, a significant number of members grew dissatisfied with the changes implemented within the organization, as mentioned in the initial statement. This dissatisfaction led to defections and the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society, some of which still exist today. In conclusion, to answer the question \\"What were all members instructed to report weekly to the Brooklyn headquarters?\\": Members of the Watch Tower Society, under the leadership of Joseph Franklin Rutherford, were instructed to report their evangelizing activities, such as time spent preaching, literature distributed, and time spent conducting Bible studies, to the Brooklyn headquarters on a weekly basis. This reporting system was introduced to better assess the growth of the organization and to allocate resources efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Available options: + yes + it is not possible to tell + no","completion":"No, we cannot conclude the hypothesis \\"Economists all agree that private savings is a serious problem.\\" as true, based on the premise given. The premise itself states that economists do not agree on whether the low personal saving rate is a problem or if private saving is inadequate to finance domestic investment. The field of economics encompasses a wide range of theories, methodologies, and perspectives; hence, it is not surprising that there might be varying opinions among economists. This disagreement may stem from multiple factors, such as differing assumptions, analysis methods, priorities, or interpretations of available data. Consequently, it is difficult to establish a consensus on a single hypothesis, especially when the topic is as complex as the relationship between private savings and domestic investment. Some economists argue that a low personal saving rate is an issue since higher private savings can help finance domestic investments, potentially leading to more robust economic growth, increased productivity, and job creation. They may further assert that more considerable savings can provide a cushion for individuals and families during economic downturns, reducing the reliance on public assistance programs. On the other hand, other economists might view the low personal saving rate as less of a concern as they believe that other sources of finance could compensate for the lack of private savings, such as foreign investment, government expenditure, or by borrowing. According to this perspective, the primary focus should be on optimizing economic policies and regulatory frameworks to attract investments, rather than emphasizing private savings. Furthermore, some economists might argue that a low personal saving rate could indicate a high degree of consumer confidence and strong consumption, which can drive economic growth. Thus, they may contend that a low personal saving rate is not inherently problematic. To sum up, the hypothesis that \\"Economists all agree that private savings is a serious problem\\" is not true as it contradicts the given premise. There is no consensus among economists about the severity of the low personal saving rate issue or its impact on domestic investment. The disagreement among economists highlights the complexities and nuances involved in understanding and analyzing the interplay between private savings and investment within an economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rio's slums the hot World Cup destination? updated 8:14 AM EST, Wed February 26, 2014 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- High above the beaches in Rio de Janeiro's hillside slums, you can get some of the best views in town. And now, they come from some of the cheapest rooms as well. With the World Cup less than four months away, residents in many once infamous favelas are opening their doors to tourists, renting beds, rooms or even entire houses, and building youth hostels. \\"If you want to see the World Cup, see some football matches and experience true Brazilian life you should really check this out,\\" says Michael Blommers, a Dutch backpacker staying at a hostel in the Vidigal shantytown. Beds at hostels in Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, which usually go for around 40 a night, are expected to cost as much as 400 during the World Cup. Hotels are even more expensive, with many requiring multiple-night stays. A tourist in Rio's Vidigal favela calls to a dog on a street. But a bunk at Alto Vidigal Hostel will set guests back just 65 -- four times the usual price, but still a relative bargain. Of course, visitors staying in Rio's favelas will likely be confronted with more than just a modest room. Garbage in these areas often piles up along the roads, while electricity, water and sewage services are spotty at best. Transportation can be precarious. The biggest concern, though, is security. Just a few years ago, Rio's favelas were controlled by drug lords. Police have since stormed many of them, in a process dubbed \\"pacification,\\" driving out armed gangs in an effort to make it relatively safe for residents and visitors. But they've had mixed results. Periodic gun battles continue in many favelas. Just last week, drug traffickers shot at police posts in Rocinha, one of the biggest shantytowns in Rio. Maria Clara dos Santos says she could hear the recent shootouts from her terrace. She rents rooms in her bright yellow house to foreign tourists and says safety depends on knowing where not to go and following rules. \\"Don't use drugs, don't bring girls home, keep it a nice environment,\\" she says. A Los Angeles native, Elliot Rosenberg has launched a website with an eye on the World Cup allowing residents to rent out rooms to foreigners. With some 600,000 foreign fans expected over the course of the tournament, there could be plenty of demand. But Rosenberg believes that many of those looking for rooms will be attracted by more than just the about 50 price tags on many rooms. \\"They want more authentic, lively, meaningful experiences,\\" he says. \\"They want to see the real Rio.\\" And, of course, those great views don't hurt either.

However, visitors staying in Rio's favelas may have to deal with issues such as garbage piles, spotty utility services, and safety concerns.

Summarize this article: Even when it isn’t really necessary, a short trip to the store can do a lot to alleviate boredom. Studies show that time spent walking is more exciting than time spent waiting around for something. It helps if you can accomplish something productive along the way, but if not, it is still better than sitting around at home. Try “gamifying” chores and other work. Give yourself points for each task you accomplish and reward yourself with a night out or new toy when you earn enough points. See how quickly you can clean the kitchen. Keep track of your times and see if you can beat your best! It has become easier than ever before to share your thoughts with the world. Spend your empty time practicing your writing and working out your thoughts. If people listen, you can begin selling advertisements for a bit of extra money or get your name out there as an expert on some topic. If you have strong opinions about politics, food, or culture, try writing about those things. Otherwise, try writing stories, or just expressing your feelings. Similarly there are some websites that will compensate you for writing short articles. A number of survey websites allow you to make some money—usually not much—by telling them what you think. Some examples include SurveyMonkey, SurveySpot, My Survey, LIghtspeed Consumer Panel, Pinecone Research, Opinion OutPost, MyPoints, Springboard America, and Toluna. This is one way to spend your time and make a bit of cash on the side. Computer programs have bugs. To get out all the glitches and mistakes, programmers need people willing to play around with them. Websites like User Testing, WatusersDo, Enroll, and YouEye will compensate you for playing around with their programs. It isn’t a living, but it is one of the easiest ways to make money while wasting some time. Meditation might not seem like the most exciting activity, but it does increase concentration, which can help push away the sense of agitation that often comes with boredom. Try meditating about 20 minutes daily to increase your focus and clarity of mind. To meditate, close your eyes and clear your mind. Take one thing to focus on, perhaps an image in your head, a word, or a phrase. Think about that and whenever you mind begins to stray bring it back to the object of your attention.","completion":"The article suggests various ways to alleviate boredom and make better use of one's time.

The article also recommends utilizing idle time to practice writing and sharing thoughts on various topics, potentially leading to earning money through advertisements or becoming an expert in a particular field. Writing about topics such as politics, food, or culture, or expressing feelings and creative stories can be beneficial. Another way to spend time productively is by participating in paid surveys on websites like SurveyMonkey, SurveySpot, and Pinecone Research, among others.

It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

When we do that, we get: -87 + 52 + 334 = -13*k Now, we just need to simply add the numbers on the left side: (-87 + 52) = -35 (-35 + 334) = 299 So now our equation looks like this: 299 = -13*k To find what k is, we have to divide both sides of the equation by -13 to isolate k: 299 / -13 = k When we do that, we get: k = -23 So, the answer is k = -23.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was not surprised that the band was looking for a replacement for him?, using the article: In September 2010, Mikael Åkerfeldt stated that he was writing for a new Opeth album. The band announced on their website that they would start recording their tenth album on January 31, 2011, at the Atlantis/Metronome studios in Stockholm, once again with Jens Bogren (engineering) and Steven Wilson from Porcupine Tree as co-producer.Shortly after mixing was complete on the new album in April 2011, Opeth announced that Per Wiberg was relieved of his duties in the band. In the press statement, Mikael Åkerfeldt explained the decision, saying, \\"Mendez, Axe and Fredrik and I came to the decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album, and this came as no surprise to Per. He had, in turn, been thinking about leaving, so you could say it was a mutual decision. There's no bad blood, just a relationship that came to an end, and that's that.\\"Opeth's tenth album, Heritage, was released on September 14, 2011, to generally favorable reviews. The album sold 19,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release and debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart. Heritage debuted at number four in the band's native country of Sweden.Heritage became the second Opeth album to not feature any death growls and had a much more progressive style than previous albums from the band, something that Åkerfeldt had been wanting to do for some time.The first two songs Åkerfeldt wrote for Heritage were in the style of Watershed. After hearing the songs for the first time, Martín Méndez told Åkerfeldt that he would be disappointed if the album continued in that direction. Relieved that Méndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, Åkerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style. In the press release for Heritage, Mikael Åkerfeldt revealed that he felt as though he had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old.

Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a \\"wall\\" or \\"enclosure\\" to \\"exclude public view.\\" For example, in 1919, the Missouri legislature adopted a statute (L.1919, p. 781) which required, \\"the sentence of death should be executed within the county jail, if convenient, and otherwise within an enclosure near the jail.\\" The Missouri law permitted the local sheriff to distribute passes to individuals (usually local citizens) whom he believed should witness the hanging, but the sheriffs – for various reasons – sometimes denied passes to individuals who wanted to watch. Missouri executions conducted after 1919 were not \\"public\\" because they were conducted behind closed walls, and the general public was not permitted to attend.\\"?

A Concert: Behind Prison Walls is the fifty-fourth overall album and a live album recorded by Johnny Cash in the Tennessee Prison 1974, Cash's conceptual series of live albums recorded before an audience of prison inmates, At San Quentin is which ordinal numeral, overall album by Johnny Cash, recorded live at San Quentin State Prison on February 24, 1969? Answer:","completion":"At San Quentin is the thirty-first overall album by Johnny Cash, recorded live at San Quentin State Prison on February 24, 1969. To understand the reasoning behind this answer, we need to look into Johnny Cash's discography and how it was arranged chronologically. Prior to \\"A Concert: Behind Prison Walls,\\" Johnny Cash had released numerous albums, with some of them being live performances recorded in prisons such as Folsom and San Quentin. The key phrase in the question is \\"Johnny Cash's conceptual series of live albums recorded before an audience of prison inmates.\\" This gives us the idea that the \\"At San Quentin\\" album is part of a series of prison live albums. By establishing the fifty-fourth album as \\"A Concert: Behind Prison Walls,\\" we can deduce the ordinal numeral of \\"At San Quentin.\\" Although there is no direct information about the exact ordinal numeral of \\"At San Quentin\\" with respect to the entire discography, it is possible to reason about it by looking into the time frame between the two albums' release dates and accounting for other albums in between. \\"At San Quentin\\" was released in 1969, while \\"A Concert: Behind Prison Walls\\" was recorded in 1974. In those five years, Johnny Cash released several more albums, totaling a difference of 23 between the ordinal numerals of the two albums. Since \\"A Concert: Behind Prison Walls\\" is the fifty-fourth album, and we know there is a difference of 23 ordinal numerals between it and \\"At San Quentin,\\" we can simply subtract 23 from 54 to arrive at the ordinal numeral for \\"At San Quentin\\": 54 - 23 = 31 Therefore, \\"At San Quentin\\" is the thirty-first overall album by Johnny Cash, recorded live at San Quentin State Prison on February 24, 1969."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Rams opened the regular season at home against the Denver Broncos on September 10 with a Rams' 18-10 win. Jeff Wilkins scored all of the Rams' points by kicking six field goals, a franchise record for a single game (from 51, 48, 26, 38, 29 and 24 yards), and became the first Ram player to score 1000 points in a career. Wilkins also tied a franchise record of seven field goal attempts in one game which was first accomplished by Bob Waterfield on December 9, 1951. The Rams were unable to score a touchdown all game and went 0 for 5 in the red zone. The defense allowed just one touchdown and forced five turnovers. Three of these turnovers were interceptions, from a team that only allowed seven interceptions all of last season. First round draft pick Tye Hill intercepted a pass by Jake Plummer with 12:02 in the second quarter. It was his first in his NFL career. The defense also sacked Jake Plummer four times in the game, with Leonard Little accounting for two of them. Isaac Bruce passed Henry Ellard and Shannon Sharpe for 11th most receptions in an NFL career with his five receptions for 64 yards. Center Andy McCollum injured his left knee with 7:39 left in the second quarter and was out for the rest of the game. On September 11, 2006 it was announced that McCollum will miss the entire season and will undergo knee surgery. With the win, the Rams began their season 1-0. Question: How many field goals between 20 and 30 yards were scored? Answer:","completion":"To find the number of field goals scored between 20 and 30 yards, we need to check the distances of the six field goals made by Jeff Wilkins.

Write a question about the following article: The kingdom of Assam was the last conquest of Bodawpaya. In December 1816, he sent a 16,000-strong force to Assam to install his nominee, Chandra Kanta Singh, to the Assamese throne. From their northernmost forts in Hukawng Valley in present-day northern Kachin State, the Burmese army crossed the 9,000-foot high Himalayan Patkai range, and finally entered Assam in early 1817. The army decisively defeated the Assamese army at the battle of Kathalguri, near the Assamese capital Jorhat. A pro-Burmese minister Badan Chandra was installed, with Singh as the nominal king. The army left in April 1817 but instabilities resumed soon after, and Singh had to flee Jorhat. The army had to return in February 1819, and reinstated Singh. A large portion of the army remained in Assam to hunt down the rebels in Upper Assam. The authority rested with the Burmese commanders, not the nominal king. Unhappy with the arrangement, Singh switched his allegiance to the British in April 1821, and tried to drive out the Burmese. His first attack on the Burmese garrison at Gauhati in September 1821 failed. But reinforced by British arms and personnel, Singh took Gauhati in January 1822, and marched to Jorhat. But the capital had been reinforced by a 20,000-strong army led by Bandula, who had just arrived. Bandula defeated Singh on 17 April 1822 at Mahgarh near Jorhat.

(AP) — The parents of a New Jersey boy who was 4 when he fatally shot a 6-year-old neighbor have been ordered to pay nearly 600,000 to the slain youth's family. Anthony and Melissa Senatore will also have to pay punitive damages to Brandon Holt's parents under the ruling issued Monday. But that amount hasn't been determined. Anthony Senatore has admitted keeping a loaded .22-caliber rifle unlocked in his bedroom, where his son found it in April 2013. The boy took it outside and shot Brandon Holt once in the head. Senatore received a three-year prison term last year after he pleaded guilty to child endangerment. The rulings came in a wrongful death suit brought by Holt's family. The Senatores were ordered to pay 572,588. ||||| TOMS RIVER -- A Superior Court judge ordered the parents of a preschooler who shot his 6-year-old neighbor to death with a loaded rifle they kept under their bed to pay more than 570,000 to the dead boy's parents. The 572,588.26 award Monday to Christine and Ronald Holt was Judge Robert Brenner's finding in the wrongful death suit the former Toms River couple brought against Anthony and Melissa Senatore in 2013 shooting death of their son Brandon Holt. Anthony Senatore has not disputed leaving his loaded rifle under his bed before the April 8, 2013, shooting so Brenner was left to determine how much Senatore and his wife should have to pay the Holts for the services and companionship Brandon would have provided his parents in the future, for his pain and suffering before his death and for the family's unpaid medical and funeral expenses. Brenner found Anthony Senatore 90 percent responsible for Brandon's death and Melissa Senatore 10 percent negligent because, he said, she should have known the weapon was under the bed. Photographs of the dark wood floor under the Senatores' bed showed it was not dusty and appeared to have been cleaned at some point. Melissa Senatore was not in court and has not responded to the lawsuit, but Brenner said she still would be held responsible for her share of the judgment. Anthony Senatore pleaded guilty to child endangerment in October 2014 and was sentenced in February 2015 to three years in prison. Under New Jersey's sentencing guidelines, he served nine months of that term before being released on parole. Brandon, who lived two houses away from the Senatores on McCormick Drive in Toms River, was playing \\"pretend shooting\\" with the Senatores' 4-year-old son on April 8, 2013, when the younger boy grabbed his father's gun and shot his friend in the head outside the Senatores' rented house. Brandon died the following day at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune. The trial, which lasted slightly less than two hours, included tearful testimony from Christine Holt, who described finding her son struggling to breathe after one of the Senatore told her Brandon was hurt. She said she didn't know he had been shot until she arrived at the hospital. She described how she tried to comfort him as he lay on the seat of the Senatores' golf cart. His eyes were open, he was bleeding from his mouth and he was gasping for air, she said. \\"I was rubbing his legs, telling him to breathe,\\" she said. \\"I kept telling him I loved him.\\" Father of boy, 4, who shot and killed 6-year-old friend sentenced to prison Anthony Senatore testified he told Ronald Holt that the boy was shot with his rifle, but Ronald Holt adamantly denied Senatore said anything about the weapon. \\"I asked him what happened and he said his eye got grazed by a pellet gun,\\" Holt said. \\"Isn't it true he told you your son was shot with a .22 (caliber) rifle,\\" Senatore's attorney, Robert Ebberup asked him on cross-examination. \\"No,\\" Holt shot back. Ebberup asked if it was possible Holt could have missed that comment in all the commotion. \\"What I heard? What he told me? I know what he said,\\" Holt replied. Brenner still has to rule on punitive damages against the Senatores but he said it would be based on their ability to pay. He gave the attorneys 30 days to determine the Senatores' financial assets. Since the shooting, the Senatores have moved to Pine Beach and the Holts have moved to the Manahawkin section of Stafford Township. They have an 18-month-old son and Christine Holt started a charitable organization called \\"Brandon's Elves\\" to provide children in Ocean County's social services programs with Christmas gifts. The trial was much shorter than the average wrongful death case because Senatore did not dispute his responsibility in Brandon's death and because the Senatores, as renters, had no homeowners insurance that would have involved another party.

(CBSNewYork) — It was a tragedy beyond comprehension that shattered the lives of two families in Toms River, New Jersey. Six-year-old Brandon Holt was shot by his 4-year-old playmate with a gun that had been left unsecured, CBS2’s Christine Sloane reported. For the first time, the public heard from Brandon’s parents who testified Monday in the civil trial of the gun owner. The mother and father relived the painful moment of running up to their neighbor’s home to find their 6-year-old son accidentally shot in the head by another child. He was still conscious in a gold cart, but later died in the hospital. “He was laying on the bench like the seat laying down… he was bleeding,” mother Christine Holt said. “I was just rubbing his legs telling him I was there, telling him to breath ’cause he was trying to breath… I just kept telling him I loved him.” Ronald Hold, the victim’s father, said he “could see [his] son’s eye really swollen and trying to catch his breath.” Defendant Anthony Senatore confirmed that the gun in his son’s hand was his while testifying in the wrongful death suit against him. Senatore said he forgot he had placed the .22-caliber rifle under his bed. He’s already served nine months in the criminal case. “When the gun went off I turned around, realized what gun it had been so I immediately removed it from his hands,” he said. “My daughter had came around the side of my house and said, “Dad, Brandon was shot.'” The judge is awarding the couple 572,588 dollars, but they say it wasn’t about the money. “I just want everyone to now just lock up your guns. That’s what it was about today– just lock up your guns,” Christine Holt said. The Holts told CBS2 they now have an 18-month-old child. Senatore’s attorney said the owner of the gun is suffering too. The couple was awarded compensatory damages on Monday, but everyone is due back in court in a month for the judge’s punitive damages decision. |||||","completion":"This case revolves around an incident that occurred in April 2013 in Toms River, New Jersey, where Anthony and Melissa Senatore's 4-year-old son fatally shot their 6-year-old neighbor, Brandon Holt, with a .22-caliber rifle that was kept unlocked in Anthony Senatore's bedroom. The young boy found the loaded gun, took it outside, and shot Brandon Holt in the head. As a result of this incident, the Senatores were brought to court for a wrongful death suit by the Holt family. In the trial, Judge Robert Brenner found Anthony Senatore to be 90 percent responsible for Brandon's death due to leaving the loaded gun under his bed, and deemed Melissa Senatore 10 percent negligent because she should have known the gun's whereabouts. The trial took less than two hours, and involved testimony from Brandon's mother, Christine Holt, who tearfully recounted the ordeal of discovering her son in a grave condition without initially knowing he had been shot. Anthony Senatore pleaded guilty to charges of child endangerment related to the incident in October 2014 and was subsequently sentenced in February 2015 to serve a three-year prison term. However, under New Jersey's sentencing guidelines, he was released on parole after serving nine months in prison. In addition to this, both Anthony and Melissa Senatore have been ordered to pay 572,588 to the Holt family due to the rulings from the wrongful death suit. This figure represents the compensation the Holts were awarded for the loss of their son, covering services and companionship he would have provided his parents in the future, his pain and suffering, and unpaid medical and funeral expenses of the family. However, the Senatores' financial obligations are not concluded yet as they also have to pay punitive damages to the Holts. The amount for punitive damages remains undetermined as the court has yet to make a ruling on the matter and will base the amount on the Senatores' ability to pay. Both parties have been given 30 days to evaluate the Senatores' financial assets to help determine this amount. Both families have since moved, with the Holts continuing their life in the Manahawkin section of Stafford Township, where they have an 18-month-old son. In honor of their late son, they have also started a charitable organization called \\"Brandon's Elves\\" that provides Christmas gifts to children in Ocean County's social services programs. Despite the substantial sum awarded to them, the Holts expressed that the lawsuit was not about money, but rather a plea for responsible gun ownership. Christine Holt urged everyone to \\"just lock up your guns\\" to avoid future tragedies. The Senatores' lawyer mentioned that Anthony Senatore, as the owner of the gun involved in the tragic shooting, is also suffering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Where does Larry Wilson work? Title: Weekend at Bernie's Movie plot: Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are two low-level financial employees at an insurance corporation in New York City. While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers a series of payments made for the same death. Richard and Larry take their findings to the CEO, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), who commends them for discovering insurance fraud and invites them to his Hamptons island beach house for the Labor Day weekend. Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partner Vito (Louis Giambalvo), Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed. However, after Bernie leaves, Vito decides Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his greed and his relationship with Vito's girlfriend, Tina (Catherine Parks), and orders that he be killed instead. Bernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and plans the murders with Paulie (Don Calfa), the hitman, on the phone, unaware the conversation is being recorded on his answering machine. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives, killing Bernie with a drug overdose. When Larry and Richard arrive at Bernie's house, they find Bernie's body. Before they can call the police, guests arrive for a party that Bernie used to host every weekend. To Larry and Richard's amazement, the guests are too engrossed in their partying to notice he is dead, with the dopey grin from the fatal injection and his sunglasses concealing his lifeless state. Fearing implication in Bernie's death, and wanting to enjoy the luxury of the house for the weekend, Larry proposes he and Richard maintain the illusion that Bernie is still alive, a notion that Richard finds absurd. Only the arrival of Richard's office crush, Gwen Saunders (Catherine Mary Stewart), convinces him to go along with Larry's plan.

Alan Pardew is set to drop £12million Remy Cabella as he admits there is one simple solution to easing the pressure on his position – victory at Swansea on Saturday.

Fans on the street have started to let their feelings be known and defeat at Swansea would make for an uncomfortable international fortnight. Remy Cabella (left) passes the ball whilst being challenged by Mike Williamson during training on Thursday Newcastle boss Alan Pardewis under intense pressure to turn around the club's fortunes Stoke is a tough game but","completion":"Newcastle United have faced an even tougher challenge off the pitch as Alan Pardew has borne the brunt of fans' frustrations. His position as manager has become increasingly precarious due to a series of poor results, leading to intense discussions about his future at the club. In a bid to find a much-needed solution, Pardew has indicated that he is considering dropping Remy Cabella, the club's £12 million summer signing, ahead of Saturday's crucial clash against Swansea City. Arriving from Montpellier with a hefty price tag and high expectations, Remy Cabella has thus far failed to live up to the hype surrounding his transfer. The French international has struggled to adapt to the physicality and pace of the Premier League, and has not contributed the goals or assists that Newcastle so desperately need to climb up the table. It seems that Pardew has recognized the need for a change in his playing personnel, and Cabella's omission from the starting lineup could be the spark that ignites a turn in fortunes for the beleaguered manager and his team. The importance of a victory against Swansea cannot be overstated. Not only would it help to ease the mounting pressure on Pardew, but it would also serve as a morale boost for his players and the fans ahead of the international break. Given the turbulent atmosphere surrounding the club, an extended period without competitive fixtures could further isolate Pardew from his players and exacerbate the sense of dissatisfaction among the supporters. A victory at the Liberty Stadium, then, is of utmost importance, and Alan Pardew will be pulling out all the stops to secure those precious three points. In order to achieve this much-needed victory, Pardew will need to devise a tactical approach that counters Swansea's attacking threat whilst exploiting their defensive vulnerabilities. Swansea, who have enjoyed a relatively strong start to the season under Garry Monk, boast a dangerous attacking trio in Wilfried Bony, Gylfi Sigurdsson, and Jefferson Montero. Pardew must ensure that his defensive unit remains disciplined and well-organized, with captain Fabricio Coloccini playing a key role in marshaling the backline. Offensively, Newcastle must look to capitalize on Swansea's occasional lapses in concentration at the back and exploit the space vacated by their adventurous full-backs. In potentially dropping Remy Cabella, Pardew could be looking to field a more physically imposing player alongside the in-form Papiss Cissé to help unsettle the Swansea defense and hold up the ball for onrushing midfielders. Ultimately, the future of Alan Pardew at Newcastle United hinges on a delicate balancing act, with the pressure from impatient fans and the need for positive results threatening to overwhelm him. By making the bold decision to drop an underperforming Remy Cabella, Pardew has demonstrated that he is not afraid to make tough choices in the pursuit of turning his side's fortunes around. The game against Swansea promises to be a season-defining moment for both the manager and his players, and as they seek to silence their critics with a resounding victory, a challenging test awaits them at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel. Question: What did the reviewer use?

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What castle did William the Conqueror give to the king's half brother? It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...

Title: Titanic Movie plot: At the last minute, a wealthy American expatriate in Europe, Richard Sturges (Clifton Webb), buys a steerage-class ticket for the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic from a Basque immigrant. Once aboard he seeks out his runaway wife, Julia (Barbara Stanwyck). He discovers she is trying to take their two unsuspecting children, 18-year-old Annette (Audrey Dalton) and ten-year-old Norman (Harper Carter), to her hometown of Mackinac, Michigan, to raise as down-to-earth Americans rather than rootless elitists like Richard himself. As the ship prepares for departure, her captain, E. J. Smith (Brian Aherne), receives a hint from the shipping company representative that a record-setting speedy passage would be welcomed. Other passengers include a wealthy woman of a working-class origin (based on a real-life Titanic survivor Molly Brown), Maude Young (Thelma Ritter); social-climbing Earl Meeker (Allyn Joslyn); a 20-year-old Purdue University tennis player, Gifford \\"Giff\\" Rogers (Robert Wagner); and George S. Healey (Richard Basehart), a Catholic priest who has been defrocked for alcoholism. When Annette learns her mother's intentions, she insists on returning to Europe with her father on the next ship as soon as they reach America. Julia concedes that her daughter is old enough to make her own decisions, but she insists on keeping custody of Norman. This angers Richard, forcing Julia to reveal that Norman is not his child, but rather the result of a one-night stand after one of their many bitter arguments. Upon hearing that, he agrees to give up all claim to Norman. Richard joins Maude, Earl, and George Widener in the lounge to play contract bridge with them. The next morning, when Norman reminds Richard about a shuffleboard game they had scheduled, Richard coldly brushes him off. Meanwhile Giff falls for Annette at first glance.

Positive Movie Review: \\"Attack of the 50 Foot Cheer Chompers\\" \\"Attack of the 50 Foot Cheer Chompers\\" is a campy, thrilling, and downright entertaining B-movie that serves up a delightful mixture of out-of-this-world special effects, surprisingly well-developed characters, and an infectiously fun plot that keeps its audience on the edge of their seats. Directed by the fearless visionary, Jack Lancaster, this gem of a film pays homage to classic monster movies and high school comedies from a bygone era while simultaneously bringing a fresh spin to the well-trodden genres. The film centers around a group of high school cheerleaders who, after an unfortunate accident involving experimental volcanic energy-infused hair products, begin to transform into enormous, ravenous monsters hellbent on devouring everything in sight and dominating the small, unsuspecting town. The town must rally together to fight off their massive ex-cheerleader foes, and unlikely alliances form as the nerdy science whiz kid (played brilliantly by rising star Charlie Thompson) and a grizzled, emotionally-wounded war veteran (a standout performance by veteran actor, Ron Dundee) team up, along with a ragtag band of townsfolk, to save the day. With over-the-top effects, campy humor, and enough self-awareness to keep the audience engaged, \\"Attack of the 50 Foot Cheer Chompers\\" delivers a gleeful, one-of-a-kind experience. Despite the film's low budget, the special effects team pulls off the gigantic cheerleader monsters with a remarkable amount of finesse. With the help of clever camera angles, practical effects, and green screen technology, the 50-foot behemoths wreak believable havoc on the town, eliciting both awe and well-timed moments of laughs along the way. Character development is one of the unexpected strengths of this film, as both the central protagonists and a cast of quirky, multidimensional supporting characters facilitate genuine emotional investment from the viewers. The sincere friendships and burgeoning romance amidst the sci-fi chaos add a depth that is usually missing in stereotypical B-movies, making it easier to root for the heroes and hope for their success. The joy of \\"Attack of the 50 Foot Cheer Chompers\\" is that it never takes itself too seriously. It taps into the nostalgia of classic 1950s sci-fi monsters and cheesy high school dramas, striking a perfect balance between the two. Every absurdity and plot twist is presented with a loving, tongue-in-cheek humor that invites the audience to revel in the campiness and have a blast watching the movie. For fans of B-movies, thrillers, or just some good old-fashioned fun, \\"Attack of the 50 Foot Cheer Chompers\\" is pure popcorn entertainment at its finest. Underneath the outrageous premise and pulpy exterior lies a heartwarming story of friendship, redemption, and the resilience of the human spirit. This movie is not only a must-see but also a cult classic just waiting to happen. Overall, \\"Attack of the 50 Foot Cheer Chompers\\" wins a solid 4 out of 5 stars for its undeniable charm, sly humor, memorable characters, and impressive filmmaking considering its budget constraints. If you're in the mood for a fun-filled romp that will leave you grinning from ear to ear, this is the film for you!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

How do I lose weight if I am already skinny? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. They are related to weight loss but concern two different situations. 1. How can I lose weight if I'm 110 kgs? This question addresses the situation of someone who weighs 110 kilograms (about 242 lbs) and wants to lose weight. The goal is to reduce body weight by following a specific diet, exercise, and lifestyle plan. Step-by-step approach to lose weight in this case: a) Consult a doctor or nutritionist to determine the ideal weight and set a realistic weight loss goal. b) Create a calorie deficit by adjusting dietary intake to consume fewer calories than those burnt daily. c) Incorporate healthier food choices, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, into the diet while reducing sugar and processed foods. d) Implement regular exercise, including at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week and strength training exercises. e) Monitor progress regularly and make adjustments to the plan as needed. f) Ensure adequate sleep and stress management to support healthy weight loss. 2. How do I lose weight if I am already skinny? This question concerns an individual who is already considered skinny or lean but still wants to lose weight. This may not always be a healthy goal, and it is essential to ensure that weight loss is for the right reasons, such as improving overall health or enhancing athletic performance without jeopardizing wellbeing. Step-by-step approach for weight loss in this case: a) Assess if losing more weight is genuinely necessary and consult a doctor or nutritionist for guidance. b) If weight loss is deemed appropriate, focus on body composition changes, such as reducing body fat percentage while maintaining or increasing lean muscle mass. c) Incorporate a balanced macronutrient diet that supports lean muscle growth and fat loss. d) Engage in regular strength training exercises with a focus on progressive resistance and functional movements. e) Include cardiovascular exercise to support heart health and burn additional calories. f) Maintain healthy sleep patterns and manage stress to ensure overall health and wellbeing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Physiology is the scientific study of the normal function in living systems. A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans. - The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, administered by the Nobel Foundation, is awarded once a year for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. It is one of five Nobel Prizes established in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, in his will. Nobel was personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a prize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories. The Nobel Prize is presented to the recipient(s) at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award. The front side of the medal provides the same profile of Alfred Nobel as depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature; its reverse side is unique to this medal. - Herbert Spencer Gasser ( 5 July 1888 -- 11 May 1963 ) was an American physiologist , and recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1944 for his work with action potentials in nerve fibers while on the faculty of Washington University in St. Louis , awarded jointly with Joseph Erlanger . - Joseph Erlanger (January 5, 1874 December 5, 1965) was an American physiologist who is best known for his contributions to the field of neuroscience. Together with Herbert Spencer Gasser, he identified several varieties of nerve fiber and established the relationship between action potential velocity and fiber diameter. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1944 for these achievements. - In physiology, an action potential is a short-lasting event in which the electrical membrane potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls, following a consistent trajectory. Action potentials occur in several types of animal cells, called excitable cells, which include neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells, as well as in some plant cells. In neurons, action potentials play a central role in cell-to-cell communication by providing for (or assisting in, with regard to saltatory conduction) the propagation of signals along the neuron's axon towards boutons at the axon ends which can then connect with other neurons at synapses, or to motor cells or glands. In other types of cells, their main function is to activate intracellular processes. In muscle cells, for example, an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction. In beta cells of the pancreas, they provoke release of insulin. Action potentials in neurons are also known as \\"nerve impulses\\" or \\"spikes\\", and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its \\"spike train\\". A neuron that emits an action potential is often said to \\"fire\\". - The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: \\"Nobelpriset\\") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Experts set threshold for climate-change calamity The world's leading climate scientists have for the first time established a limit on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be released before the Earth reaches a tipping point and predicted that it will be surpassed within decades unless swift action is taken to curb the current pace of emissions. The warning was issued Friday by a panel of U.N.-appointed climate change experts meeting in Stockholm. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that once a total of 1 trillion tons of carbon dioxide are emitted into atmosphere, the planet will exceed 3.6 degrees of warming, the internationally agreed-upon threshold to the worst effects of climate change. \\"We've burned through half that amount\\" since preindustrial times, Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University who reviewed the report and is a co-author of the panel's upcoming report on the effect of climate change, said in an interview. \\"Because the rates of emissions are growing, it looks like we could burn through the other half in the next 25 years\\" under one of the more dire scenarios outlined in the report. Other scenarios show that the threshold will be reached later this century. The finding constitutes a warning to governments to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, which is generated by the burning of fossil fuels, industrial activity and deforestation. Calling climate change \\"the greatest challenge of our time,\\" panel co-chair Thomas Stocker said humankind's fate in the next 100 years \\"depends crucially on how much carbon dioxide will be emitted in the future.\\" In the report, the panel said it is 95% certain that human activity is the dominant cause of the global warming observed since the 1950s. That is up from 90% six years ago. \\"Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes,\\" the report said. The report is the panel's fifth major assessment since 1990. It reaffirms many of the conclusions of past reports, but with greater confidence. \\"The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased,\\" the panel wrote in a 36-page summary of its findings, released Friday. \\"Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.\\" The panel's full 2,500-page report will be published Monday. The report also addressed the so-called hiatus, a slowdown in the rise of surface temperature that has been observed over the last 15 years. That slowing of the increase in temperatures has been seized on by skeptics to cast doubt on the science of climate change. The report touches the subject only briefly, saying that temperatures fluctuate naturally in the short term and \\"do not in general reflect long-term climate trends.\\" Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the slowdown is more like a speed bump, a result of heat being trapped and circulated through the ocean and atmosphere in different ways rather than a fundamental change in the climate. She said surface temperature is just one of many expressions of climate change, including sea level rise, melting ice and ocean acidification. \\"The global average temperature is one kind of a thermometer, but an even bigger thermometer is the ocean, which is absorbing most of the excess heat that climate change is creating,\\" she said. The report updates predictions of how temperature and sea level are expected to rise over the century. The panel now expects sea level to rise globally by 10 inches to 32 inches by century's end, up from the rise of 7 inches to 23 inches it projected in 2007. Those figures now include the contribution of massive ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland that are creeping toward the ocean as they melt. The panel failed to account for that variable in its previous report, prompting criticism from the scientific community that its previous sea level rise projections were too low. The panel also lowered the bottom of the range of temperature increase expected over the long term if carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere double. The planet would warm by at least 2.7 degrees even if aggressive action is taken to cut emissions, but temperatures could rise as much as 8.1 degrees in other scenarios.","completion":"Climate scientists have established a limit on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be released before the Earth reaches a tipping point.

Lead archaeologist Richard Buckley, from the University of Leicester, told a press conference to applause: \\"Beyond reasonable doubt it's Richard.\\" Richard, killed in battle in 1485, will be reinterred in Leicester Cathedral. Interactive: Twisted bones reveal a king Mr Buckley said the bones had been subjected to \\"rigorous academic study\\" and had been carbon dated to a period from 1455-1540. Dr Jo Appleby, an osteo-archaeologist from the university's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, revealed the bones were of a man in his late 20s or early 30s. Richard was 32 when he died. His skeleton had suffered 10 injuries, including eight to the skull, at around the time of death. Two of the skull wounds were potentially fatal. One was a \\"slice\\" removing a flap of bone, the other was caused by bladed weapon which went through and hit the opposite side of the skull - a depth of more than 10cm (4ins). Dr Appleby said: \\"Both of these injuries would have caused an almost instant loss of consciousness and death would have followed quickly afterwards. Source: BBC History The real Richard III - mad murderer or a man of his times? Testing Richard's bones - how does DNA analysis work? \\"In the case of the larger wound, if the blade had penetrated 7cm into the brain, which we cannot determine from the bones, death would have been instantaneous.\\" Other wounds included slashes or stabs to the face and the side of the head. There was also evidence of \\"humiliation\\" injuries, including a pelvic wound likely to have been caused by an upward thrust of a weapon, through the buttock. Richard III was portrayed as deformed by some Tudor historians and indeed the skeleton's spine is badly curved, a condition known as scoliosis. However, there was no trace of a withered arm or other abnormalities described in the more extreme characterisations of the king. Without the scoliosis, which experts believe developed during teenage years, he would have been about 5ft 8ins (1.7m) tall, but the curvature would have made him appear \\"considerably\\" shorter. Dr Appleby said: \\"The analysis of the skeleton proved that it was an adult male but was an unusually slender, almost feminine, build for a man. \\"Taken as a whole, the skeletal evidence provides a highly convincing case for identification as Richard III.\\" Richard was a royal prince until the death of his brother Edward IV in 1483. Appointed as protector of his nephew, Edward V, Richard instead assumed the reins of power. Edward and his brother Richard, known as the Princes in the Tower, disappeared soon after. Rumours circulated they had been murdered on the orders of their uncle. Challenged by Henry Tudor, Richard was killed at Bosworth in 1485 after only two years on the throne. He was given a hurried burial beneath the church of Greyfriars in the centre of Leicester. Mr Buckley said the grave was clumsily cut, with sloping sides and too short for the body, forcing the head forward. • Wealth of evidence, including radiocarbon dating, radiological evidence, DNA and bone analysis and archaeological results, confirms identity of last Plantagenet king who died over 500 years ago • DNA from skeleton matches two of Richard III's maternal line relatives. Leicester genealogist verifies living relatives of Richard III's family • Individual likely to have been killed by one of two fatal injuries to the skull - one possibly from a sword and one possibly from a halberd • Ten wounds discovered on skeleton - Richard III killed by trauma to the back of the head. Part of the skull sliced off • Radiocarbon dating reveals individual had a high protein diet - including significant amounts of seafood - meaning he was likely to be of high status • Radiocarbon dating reveals individual died in the second half of the 15th or in the early 16th Century - consistent with Richard's death in 1485 • Skeleton reveals severe scoliosis - onset believed to have occurred at the time of puberty • Although about 5ft 8in tall (1.7m), the condition meant King Richard III would have stood significantly shorter and his right shoulder may have been higher than the left • Feet were truncated at an unknown point in the past, but a significant time after the burial \\"There was no evidence of a coffin or shroud which would have left the bones in a more compact position. \\"Unusually, the arms are crossed and this could be an indication the body was buried with the wrists still tied,\\" he added. Greyfriars church was demolished during the Reformation in the 16th Century and over the following centuries its exact location was forgotten. However, a team of enthusiasts and historians managed to trace the likely area - and, crucially, after painstaking genealogical research, they found a 17th-generation descendant of Richard's sister with whose DNA they could compare any remains. Joy Ibsen, from Canada, died several years ago but her son, Michael, who now works in London, provided a sample. The researchers were fortunate as, while the DNA they were looking for was in all Joy Ibsen's offspring, it is only handed down through the female line and her only daughter has no children. The line was about to stop. But the University of Leicester's experts had other problems. Dr Turi King, project geneticist, said there had been concern DNA in the bones would be too degraded: \\"The question was could we get a sample of DNA to work with, and I am extremely pleased to tell you that we could.\\" She added: \\"There is a DNA match between the maternal DNA of the descendants of the family of Richard III and the skeletal remains we found at the Greyfriars dig. \\"In short, the DNA evidence points to these being the remains of Richard III.\\" In August 2012, an excavation began in a city council car park - the only open space remaining in the likely area - which quickly identified buildings connected to the church. The bones were found in the first days of the dig and were eventually excavated under forensic conditions. Details of the reburial ceremony have yet to be released, but Philippa Langley from the Richard III Society said plans for a tomb were well advanced. She said of the discovery of Richard's skeleton: \\"I'm totally thrilled, I'm overwhelmed to be honest, it's been a long hard journey. I mean today as we stand it's been nearly four years. \\"It's the culmination of a lot of hard work. I think, as someone said to me earlier, it's just the end of the beginning. \\"We're going to completely reassess Richard III, we're going to completely look at all the sources again, and hopefully there's going to be a new beginning for Richard as well.\\"","completion":"A group of experts found some old bones that belonged to a very important king named Richard III. They made sure by comparing the bones' DNA with the DNA of people who are related to Richard's family. Richard III was a king a long time ago, and he died in a big battle. The scientists found out that he had many injuries on his head and other parts of his body. They also figured out that his back was curved, making him look shorter than he was. These findings help us learn more about this king and his life.

Movie title: Condemned to Live Context: The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan (Ralph Morgan) after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's named Dr. Bizet arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance (Maxine Doyle) is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows. A:","completion":"The villagers blame a giant bat for the murders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Zorro (Spanish for \\"fox\\") is a fictional character created in 1919 by American pulp writer Johnston McCulley, and appearing in works set in the Pueblo of Los Angeles during the era of Spanish California (1769-1821). He is typically portrayed as a dashing masked vigilante who defends the commoners and indigenous peoples of California against corrupt and tyrannical officials and other villains. His signature all-black costume includes a cape, a hat known as sombrero cordobes, and a domino mask that covers the upper part of his face. In the stories, Zorro has a high bounty on his head, but is too skilled and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch, and he also delights in publicly humiliating them. Context: In The Curse of Capistrano, Senor Zorro became an outlaw in the pueblo of Los Angeles in California \\"to avenge the helpless, to punish cruel politicians, to aid the oppressed.\\" He is the title character, as he is dubbed the \\"Curse of Capistrano\\". The novel features extensively both Don Diego Vega and Zorro, but the fact that they are the same person is not revealed to the reader until the end of the book. In the story, both Diego and Zorro romance Lolita Pulido, an impoverished noblewoman. While Lolita is unimpressed with Diego, who pretends to be a passionless fop, she is attracted to the dashing Zorro. The main villain is Captain Ramon, who also has his eyes on Lolita. Other characters include Sgt. Pedro Gonzales, Zorro's enemy but Diego's friend; Diego's deaf and mute servant Bernardo; his ally, Fray (Friar) Felipe; his father Don Alejandro Vega, the richest landowner in California and a widower; Don Carlos Pulido and his wife, Dona Catalina, Lolita's parents; and a group of noblemen (caballeros) who, at first, hunt Zorro but are then won over to his cause. In later stories, McCulley introduces characters such as pirates and Native Americans, some of whom know Zorro's identity. In McCulley's later stories, Diego's surname became de la Vega. In fact, the writer was wildly inconsistent. The first magazine serial ended with the villain dead and Diego publicly exposed as Zorro. But in the sequel, the villain was alive and the next entry had the double identity still secret. Several Zorro productions have expanded on the character's exploits. Many of the continuations feature a younger character taking up the mantle of Zorro. McCulley's stories are set during the during the era of Spanish California (1769-1821) and, although exact years are often vague, the presence of the Pueblo of Los Angeles means the stories cannot happen before 1781, the year it was founded. Some media adaptations of Zorro's story have placed him during the later era of Mexican California (1821-1846). The character's visual motif is typically a black costume with a black flowing Spanish cape or cloak, a black flat-brimmed hat known as sombrero cordobes, and a black sackcloth mask that covers the top of the head from eye level upwards. Sometimes the mask is a two piece, the main item being a blindfold-type fabric with slits for the eyes, and the other item being a bandana over the head, so that it is covered even if the hat is removed: this is the mask worn in the movie The Mark of Zorro (1920) and in the television series Zorro (1957-1959). Other times, the mask is a one piece that unites both items described above: this mask was introduced in The Mark of Zorro (1940) and appears in many modern versions. Zorro's mask has also occasionally been shown as being a rounded domino mask, which he wore without also wearing a bandana. In his first appearance, Zorro's cloak is purple, his hat is generically referred to as a \\"wide sombrero,\\" and his black cloth veil mask with slits for eyes covers his whole face. Other features of the costume may vary. His favored weapon is a rapier, which he also uses to often leave his distinctive mark, a Z cut with three quick strokes, on his defeated foes and other objects. He also uses other weapons, including a bullwhip and a pistol. The fox is never depicted as Zorro's emblem. It is used as a metaphor for the character's wiliness, such as in the lyrics \\"Zorro, 'the Fox', so cunning and free ...\\" from the Disney television show theme. His heroic pose consists of rearing on his horse Tornado, often saluting with his hand or raising his sword high. The logo of the company Zorro Productions, Inc. uses an image of Zorro rearing on his horse, sword raised high. Zorro is an agile athlete and acrobat, using his bullwhip as a gymnastic accoutrement to swing through gaps between city roofs, and is very capable of landing from great heights and taking a fall. Although he is a master swordsman and marksman, he has more than once demonstrated his prowess in unarmed combat against multiple opponents. His calculating and precise dexterity as a tactician has enabled him to use his two main weapons, his sword and bullwhip, as an extension of his deft hand. He never uses brute strength. Instead and more likely, he uses his fox-like and sly mind, and well-practiced technique to outmatch an opponent. In some versions, Zorro keeps a medium-sized dagger tucked in his left boot for emergencies. He has used his cape as a blind, a trip-mat and a disarming tool. Zorro's boots are also sometimes weighted, as is his hat, which he has thrown, Frisbee-style, as an efficiently substantial warning to enemies. But more often than not, he uses psychological mockery to make his opponents too angry to be coordinated in combat. Zorro is a skilled horseman. The name of his jet-black horse has varied through the years. In The Curse of Capistrano, it was unnamed. In Disney's Zorro television series the horse gets the name Tornado, which has been kept in many later adaptations. In most versions, Zorro keeps Tornado in a secret cave, connected to his hacienda with a system of secret passages and underground tunnels. McCulley's concept of a band of men helping Zorro is often absent from other versions of the character. An exception is Zorro's Fighting Legion (1939), starring Reed Hadley as Diego. In Douglas Fairbanks' version, he also has a band of masked men helping him. In McCulley's stories, Zorro was aided by a deaf-mute named Bernardo. In Disney's Zorro television series, Bernardo is not deaf but pretends to be, and serves as Zorro's secret agent. He is a capable and invaluable helper for Zorro, sometimes wearing the mask to reinforce his master's charade. The Family Channel's Zorro television series replaces Bernardo with a teenager named Felipe, played by Juan Diego Botto, with a similar disability and pretense. Question: what were some resources he used? Answer:","completion":"Some resources that Zorro used include: 1. His costume: Zorro's all-black costume with a cape, sombrero cordobes, and domino mask helped him maintain his secret identity and strike fear in the hearts of his enemies. 2. Weapons: Zorro was skilled with a variety of weapons, including a rapier, bullwhip, and pistol. He used these to disarm, disable, and defeat his adversaries while leaving his trademark \\"Z\\" mark on them. 3. Acrobatics and agility: Zorro's athletic abilities and acrobatic skills allowed him to navigate difficult terrain, evade capture, and outmaneuver his foes. 4. His horse: Zorro's jet-black horse, often named Tornado, was a key resource for him. The horse was not only fast and reliable, but also helped Zorro make a quick escape when needed. 5. Secret hideout: In most versions, Zorro kept Tornado in a secret cave, connected to his hacienda via a system of secret passages and underground tunnels. This allowed him to change into his costume, access his weapons, and formulate his plans away from prying eyes. 6. Allies: Zorro was occasionally aided by a group of men or individuals such as Bernardo, Felipe, or Fray Felipe, who helped him gather information, maintain his secret identity, and fight against the corrupt officials and other villains. 7. Psychological tactics: Zorro often used psychological warfare to provoke, confuse, and intimidate his enemies, making them lose focus and giving him an advantage in combat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This semester begins during an orientation gathering with a speech given by the stern Headmaster Nolan (Norman Lloyd), who states the academy's four pillars: Tradition, Honor, Discipline, and Excellence. Todd meets Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) an ambitious student whom becomes his dorm roommate.Later in his dorm, Neil is ordered by his grumpy and domineering father (Kurtwood Smith) to drop his involvement with the school annual in order to maintain good grades so the boy may become a doctor much as he has done. Neil is under pressure from his stern father's will. Also, Mr. Perry tells Neil that Mrs. Perry also wants him to become a doctor, which further worries the boy. A little later, Todd tells Neil that he is in a similar situation with his parents involving his older brother who also attended Welton a few years ago, graduated, and attended Yale Law School and became a lawyer and his parents want the exact same thing for him.

Answer this question: where does the last name mann come from??","completion":"The surname \\"Mann\\" has roots in multiple cultures and countries, and thus its origin varies depending on the context. Here's a detailed look at the etymology and history of this surname. 1. British Origin: In the context of British origins, the surname Mann is derived from the pre-7th century Old English word 'mann' which usually meant 'man', but could also refer to a person of mixed gender, a servant, or a vassal. The name was predominantly used as a nickname or an occupational name, perhaps designating a servant or someone considered of lesser status. It's important to note that British surnames became hereditary fairly late in history, so the surname \\"Mann\\" could have been given to a countless number of unrelated people across the British Isles who had some connection to the basic descriptors mentioned above. For instance, many individual servants, vassals or workers may have been nicknamed 'mann' and seen this title evolve into a surname over time. 2. German Origin: In German, the word 'Mann' also means 'man'. During the Middle Ages, it became a common practice to use nicknames as a last name, usually related to a person's characteristics or features, or their occupation or location. So, someone who was manly, brave, or perhaps simply an adult male, could acquire the surname Mann. It's worth noting that the name could also have served as a reduced form of compounds such as Hermann. Furthermore, many Jewish families took on the surname Mann in the 18th and 19th centuries, often for the simple reason that it indicated manhood or maturity. 3. Dutch Origin: In Dutch, the name is derived from the Middle Dutch word 'man' which means 'man'. It was most often used as a nickname or occupational name. Sometimes, the surname Mann may have been a patronymic surname derived from the first name of the father. It is important to keep in mind that regions and borders shifted over time, and with these shifts, the surname Mann may have moved and evolved. 4. Norwegian Origin: In Norway, the surname Mann can also have topographic origins. People there were often given names associated with the geographical features of their landholdings. In this context, Mann could be related to a place recognized for an important man or a group of men. 5. Jewish Origin: In Ashkenazi Jewish communities, the surname can be an acronym of the Hebrew phrase 'Moreinu ha-Rav', which means ‘our teacher the rabbi’. In summary, being a common noun in the Germanic languages, the surname 'Mann' has independently originated multiple times across Northern Europe and is, therefore, of polygenetic origin. Each instance of the surname's creation most likely had distinct circumstances, and the name could connote different meanings depending on those circumstances. Therefore, tracing a single line of origin for this surname can be a challenging task, and a person bearing this surname could have ancestors from many different regions or cultures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Shack has an arsenal of makeshift weapons: a hammer, a steel rod, and a chain. A hobo who is a hero to his peers, A-No.1, manages to hop the train with the younger, less-experienced Cigaret close behind. At the next stop, A-No.1 evades Shack and escapes into the hobo jungle, but Cigaret is caught. Shack threatens to kill Cigaret for riding his train for free, who is bragging that he and he alone did it. Shack is distracted when he learns that A-No.1 has posted a notice on the yard water tower, announcing that he will become the first hobo to ride Shack's train all the way to Portland. The other hobos agree that the first who can successfully ride Shack's train will have earned the title \\"Emperor of the North Pole.\\" Railroad workers place bets whether A-No.-1 can do it, spreading the news far and wide over the telegraph, Shack being widely known and disliked. A-No.1 hops the train and does everything he can to steer clear of Shack, pulling a series of pranks with the help of other hobos, such as running Shack's train into a siding and greasing the tracks, almost causing it to crash head on into an oncoming mail train.

What was the name of the painting that was completed in 1896 and presented to Patriarch Gerogije later that year? Answer the above question based on the context below: Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) is a set of four similar oil paintings by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements.

I read this background article the other day: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose fewer people will recycle happens, how will it affect MORE recyling. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"Yes, the perturbation of fewer people recycling will have a direct and indirect effect on the process of more recycling. If fewer people recycle, the amount of recyclable materials going to recycling centers will decrease. Consequently, the recycling centers may struggle to maintain their operations, leading to closures, reduction in workforce, or less investment in recycling technologies. This could then lead to manufacturers having less access to the recycled materials they need and may force them to rely more on new, non-recycled materials that might be more expensive or less environmentally friendly. Ultimately, this could result in a negative impact on the environment, as more waste ends up in landfills and natural resources may be further depleted for the creation of new materials. Furthermore, the reduction in recycling could indirectly affect public awareness and attitudes towards recycling, potentially further decreasing the number of people who take part in recycling. This can create a negative feedback loop, causing even more decline in recycling rates and further affecting the overall recycling process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For example, electronics could get recharged in the future simply by plugging them into your outer wear, because Australian researchers are designing clothing that can collect energy from a person. The coats would include small things that change vibration energy from a person's movements into electricity. High-tech fabrics would carry this energy to batteries . \\"It will look like an ordinary(common)coat but have super energy,\\" said Adam Best, an Australian head research scientist. \\" _ has important uses for soldiers in the field and could mean they no longer need to carry heavy batteries,'' Best added. \\"Above all, they'd be wearing the battery, not carrying it.\\" Besides helping soldiers, these coats could also have common uses for common people, such as powering radios, mobile phones, MP3 players or medical things. Solar-powered handbags could do the same thing. Thanks to self-cleaning fabrics developed by scientists working for the U. S. Air Force, underwear and sports clothing could go weeks without washing. The general idea of clothes that never get dirty can be found in the 1951 film The Man in the White Suit. The new technology helps keep off water, oil and bacteria . High-tech fabrics could also help serve as protection. For example, future fabrics could lead to soft helmets that turn hard in an accident. Not all the possible fabrics of tomorrow are necessarily high-tech. For example, chicken feathers and other things of the farming industry could get changed into wool-like fabrics or cotton-like ones, helping use fewer fabrics made from oil. Scientific development is also creating wool that doesn't become bigger or smaller after washing. And future clothing could help soldiers shoulder heavy bags and help people walk.

Article: A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant. Question: How many emotional categories did Turner recognize as being founded on human neurology?","completion":"Turner identified four emotional categories as being founded on human neurology.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Paragraph: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Milly's plan? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The number of animals is likely to increase under Milly's plan. By advocating for a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, Milly's plan aims to mitigate the effects of global warming and climate change. This would help protect natural habitats and ecosystems, which in turn would support the conservation of wildlife populations and potentially lead to an increase in the number of animals."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \\"lions\\" and \\"chimeras\\"; in later periods they are much more varied. A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings. Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.

At home he says the oath of the Green Lanterns while under trance from the glow of the lantern. After he's attacked while leaving a bar Jordan swings to punch one of his attackers, letting out a huge fist of green energy. Afterward, Jordan is whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa, where he meets and trains with Tomar-Re (voiced by Geoffrey Rush) and Kilowog (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan). He encounters Corps leader Sinestro (Mark Strong), who is not pleased that a human which is primitive compared to other species has become a Green Lantern. With Sinestro seeing him as unfit and fearful, Jordan quits and returns to Earth, keeping the power ring and lantern.Meanwhile, after being summoned by his father Senator Robert Hammond (Tim Robbins) to a secret government facility, scientist Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) performs an autopsy on Abin Sur's body. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse inserts itself inside Hammond, mutating the scientist and giving him telepathy and telekinetic powers,...","completion":"Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) as the Green Lantern kills Parallax."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Oscar Pistorius' girlfriend shot 4 times through bathroom door, official says Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Model Reeva Steenkamp was shot four times through the bathroom door at the home of Olympian Oscar Pistorius, a South African official familiar with the case told CNN on Monday. She was alive after she was shot and was carried downstairs by Pistorius, said the official, who was not authorized to release details to the media. A blood-stained cricket bat has also emerged as key evidence in the case, according to the City Press newspaper of Johannesburg. Detectives are working to determine whether the bat was used to attack Steenkamp or she used it in self-defense, the newspaper reported, citing a source with inside knowledge of the case. Detectives are also looking into the possibility that Pistorius used the bat to break down the bathroom door. The details are the latest to emerge in the shooting death that has roiled the nation and left South Africans asking what went so terribly wrong inside the upscale Pretoria home of the man nicknamed \\"Blade Runner\\" for his lightning-fast prosthetic legs. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were indications the 29-year-old model intended to stay the night at the house: She had an overnight bag and her iPad. Opinion: Pistorius case and the plague of violence against women Authorities have released little about a possible motive in the Valentine's Day shooting, while local media have reported that Pistorius had mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder. South African authorities have stressed that the scenario did not come from them, and said there was no evidence of forced entry at the home. Police have charged Pistorius with murder, and he will appear in court Tuesday for a bail hearing. South African prosecutors have said they intend to upgrade the charge to premeditated murder, but have not released further details. Pistorius, 26, has rejected the murder allegation \\"in the strongest terms,\\" his agent said in a statement. Nike's bullet ad with Pistorius backfires The same day Pistorius returns to court, Steenkamp will be buried in a private service in her hometown of Port Elizabeth. Her burial Tuesday will come two days after South Africa's national broadcaster aired a pre-recorded reality TV show featuring Steenkamp discussing her exit from \\"Tropika Island of Treasure,\\" on which local celebrities compete for prize money. The decision to air the program took \\"much deliberation,\\" and \\"this week's episode will be dedicated to Reeva's memory,\\" said Samantha Moon, the executive producer. The shooting has stunned South Africa, where Pistorius is a national hero as the first disabled athlete to compete in the able-bodied Olympic Games. He competed in the London Games as well as winning two gold medals in the Paralympic Games. Headlines about the case have dominated in the days since Pistorius was arrested, though tight-lipped authorities have revealed little about what, if anything, the track star has said. Oscar Pistorius with Reeva Steenkamp in January 2013. Reports say Pistorius and Steenkamp became an item around November and were popular in South African social circles. The night before the shooting, Steenkamp appeared to be looking forward to Valentine's Day. \\"What do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow?\\" she asked her Twitter followers the day before. \\"Get excited.\\" Steenkamp was found in a pool of blood at Pistorius' home Thursday morning. Neighbors alerted authorities to the early morning shooting, saying they had \\"heard things earlier,\\" police spokeswoman Denise Beukes has said. She did not clarify what the neighbors reported they heard. Authorities also have not said whether Pistorius called for help. Pictures of his walk to a police car, his head covered by a sweatshirt, have flashed repeatedly across television screens. On Sunday, Pistorius canceled his appearances in five upcoming races.

The Original Wolf of Wall Street Carl Icahn Returns By Rana Foroohar Monday, Dec. 16, 2013 Carl Icahn is the richest man on Wall Street. He's the most feared corporate raider In the world. He may also be the most entertaining financier on the planet. Having grown up in a family that resembled a darker version of Woody Allen's multigenerational working-class Jewish clan in Radio Days, Icahn is prone to one-liners. His real talent is as a mimic, but when I ask him to do Apple CEO Tim Cook, he declines. \\"Nah, I can't do Cook. I can only do crazies.\\" Of course, some people say Cook is crazy to listen to Icahn, who has been trying to persuade him since August to give some of Apple's 147 billion cash hoard back to investors in the form of a massive share buyback. Now Icahn is ratcheting up the pressure: he tells TIME that he filed a precatory proposal with Apple on Nov. 26, three days before the deadline for measures to be voted on at the company's next annual shareholders meeting. His proposal, which calls for a stock buyback, would not be binding on the company's management, and that's typical for shareholder resolutions. But a buyback would almost certainly push up the price of Apple's stock--and increase the value of Icahn's 2 billion in Apple holdings along with those of all the other Apple investors. Icahn says he doesn't consider his proposal an indictment of Cook, who has been at Apple's helm since Steve Jobs died in 2011. \\"Tim Cook is doing a good job with the business,\\" Icahn tells TIME. \\"I think he's good at running the business whether he does what I want or not.

We all talk a fair game about what needs to be on your resume, but there’s also plenty of stuff that should be removed. The fluff. The blabber. The full-on oddities. And even some of the details you think are important. Here’s the thing: If you want a shot at grabbing your target audience and showing them what you’re made of, every section of your resume needs to be thoughtfully constructed, and every word carefully placed. So, let’s all get out our big red markers; we’re going to start marking that baby up. Here are seven things that you absolutely must drop-kick from your resume. The vast majority of objectives say nothing. Oh, so you’re seeking a challenging position with a growing corporation that will allow you to make a positive contribution, are you? How groundbreaking. Craft an executive summary or “Who I Am” section that showcases your overarching value proposition (or, as I call it, your “So what?”) and speaks directly to the stuff you know the target audience is going to care the most about. This is your chance to make it clear you’re a strong fit. Do you practice witchcraft, preside over your local gun club, or spend endless hours practicing your extraordinary mime routine? Terrific. But unless you are applying for jobs that will specifically value these interests (or they’re flat-out amazing conversation starters), leave them off. Decision makers will judge the heck out of you if they spot hobbies that fly in the face of their own personal beliefs or seem odd. Include interests only if you feel they support your overall professional message and brand. If you’re a dietician who maintains a recipe blog for fun, yes. If you’re an accountant who enjoys photographing people’s feet, absolutely not. The fastest way to sound like a pompous goof is to construct your resume in the third person—à la “John raised more than 70,000 for the organization.” Every single time I read a resume in which the author does this, all I can think of is someone sitting around in a smoking jacket, with a pipe, pontificating on and on about himself. Don’t do it. When you write a resume, your name and contact information are at the top of the page. For this reason alone, the receiver will most assuredly deduce that the document he or she is receiving was, indeed, from you. So write the resume in the first person, minus the pronouns (e.g., “Raised more than 70,000”). Nothing says, “I job search on company time” quite like using your current work email address on a resume. Unless you own the company, it’s poor form to run your job search through your company’s email system. Easy–use your personal email for all job search business. And, ideally, your own time. Why “utilize” when you can “use?” Why “append” when you can “add?” It’s not “analogous;” it’s really just “similar.” Using non-conversational words doesn’t make you look smart; it makes you look like someone who spends too much time in a thesaurus. Run the “would I ever say this in real life?” test on every phrase and sentence in your resume. If you find words or statements that don’t read like something you’d say? Change ’em up. Your resume is not an autobiography of every job you’ve held since you graduated; it’s a marketing document. So, unless something you did more than 12-15 years ago is vital for your target audience to know about, you don’t need to list the entry-level job or internship you held in 1994. It’s totally OK to leave some of the life history off. For each former job, think about what you did or achieved that will be required (or will hold significant value) in your next role. Showcase only that stuff. If your first job out of college does nothing to support this overall message? It’s probably not needed. If you’d like me to, I’ll launch into the story about the field engineer I worked with who was this close to landing a great job—until the employer conducted a degree verification and discovered that, while he’d taken courses at that university, he didn’t graduate. The kicker? He didn’t even need a degree to qualify for that job. But because he got caught in a lie, he didn’t get it. Strategize. (In this case, I would have suggested that this engineer load his education section with professional development courses and certifications, which would have made an equally great impact.) Whatever you do, do not lie. Editing a resume can be tough. People tend to be quite attached to the things they’ve done or accomplished professionally, and passionate about their outside interests. But the bottom line is this: You need to have everything working for you on your resume. Be brutally objective, cut the fat, and for goodness’ sake, leave off all details of your vast collection of clown figures. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"When crafting your resume, it's essential to focus on what really matters to make a strong impression. Here are seven things to remove from your resume: 1. Generic objectives: Replace them with an executive summary that highlights your unique value proposition. 2.

Your work email address: Use a personal email for job search business to avoid appearing unprofessional. 5. Overly complex language: Stick to conversational words that are easy to understand. 6. Irrelevant job experiences: Focus on the jobs and achievements that are relevant and valuable for the position you're applying for. 7. False information: Never lie on your resume, as it can cost you a job opportunity and damage your reputation. Instead, strategize and focus on your strengths."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who does Peter Graves play? Movie title: Killers from Space Movie plot: Dr. Douglas Martin (Peter Graves) is a nuclear scientist working on atomic bomb tests. While collecting aerial data on a United States Air Force (USAF) atomic blast at Soledad Flats, he loses control of his aircraft and crashes. He appears to have survived, unhurt, walking back to the air base with no memory of what happened. On his chest is a strange scar that was not there before the crash. At the base hospital, Martin acts so strangely that the USAF brings in the FBI to investigate, thinking he might be an impostor. He is eventually cleared but told to take some time off. Martin protests being excluded from his project while on leave. When an atomic test is set off without his knowledge, Martin steals the data, then goes back to Soledad Flats and places the information under a stone. An FBI agent follows him, but Martin is able to elude him until he crashes his car. Now back at the hospital, he is given truth serum. Deep under the drug's influence, Martin tells a story about being held captive, by space aliens in their underground base., The aliens, with large, bulging eyes, are from the planet Astron Delta. They had revived his lifeless body as he had died in his aircraft. The aliens plan to exterminate humanity using giant insects and reptiles, grown with the radiation absorbed from our own atomic bomb tests. Martin intuits that the aliens use stolen electric grid power to control their powerful equipment. This so that the A-bomb's released energy levels can be predicted and then balanced. The aliens wiped his memory and hypnotized him into collecting the data for them. The FBI agent (Steve Pendleton) and the base commander (James Seay) are skeptical of this incredible story and keep him confined at the hospital. Nevertheless, the attending physician says that Martin genuinely believes that what he told them is true. With calculations made with a slide rule, Martin determines that if he shuts off the power to Soledad Flats for just 10 seconds, it will create an overload in the aliens' equipment. So he...

Scott Stevens, the Idaho meteorologist who claimed that a weather manipulating conspiracy (possibly under the control of Japanese Yakuza mafia) caused Hurricane Katrina, has quit his job at KPVI-TV in Pocatello. Can we infer the following? Scott believed the mafia was involved with the hurricane.","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can infer that Scott Stevens, a meteorologist from Idaho, believed that there was a weather manipulating conspiracy in relation to Hurricane Katrina. He claimed that it was possibly under the control of the Japanese Yakuza mafia, hence implicating their involvement with the hurricane. Scott Stevens worked as a meteorologist at KPVI-TV in Pocatello, Idaho. His claims about the weather manipulating conspiracy indicate that he held unconventional beliefs about the cause of the catastrophic weather event known as Hurricane Katrina. Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5 storm that devastated the Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly affecting Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, in August 2005. It caused widespread destruction, death, and displacement and is considered one of the most destructive hurricanes in United States history. It is important to note that Scott Stevens' belief in a conspiracy involving the Japanese Yakuza mafia and Hurricane Katrina is not supported by scientific evidence or widely accepted meteorological studies. The general consensus among scientists and meteorologists is that hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina, form as a result of natural processes influenced by atmospheric temperature, ocean temperature, wind patterns, and other factors. The concept of weather manipulation does exist in the realm of scientific research. It mainly refers to cloud seeding, which alters the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds, or geoengineering, which is the large-scale intervention in the Earth's climatic system to counteract climate change. However, there is no clear evidence to support the idea that weather manipulation to the extent of creating or steering destructive hurricanes like Katrina is currently possible, let alone that it was perpetrated by an organized crime group like the Japanese Yakuza mafia. Given Scott Stevens' unconventional beliefs, which were not backed by scientific evidence, it is understandable that his claims led to him stepping down from his position as a meteorologist at KPVI-TV. While we can infer that Stevens believed the mafia had a role in manipulating Hurricane Katrina based on the information given, it is crucial to recognize that this belief is not consistent with established scientific understanding and should not be treated as a widely accepted explanation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Richard Nixon Presidential Library will allow access Tuesday to about 154 hours of Nixon White House tape recordings and 30,000 pages of documents that were formerly classified. President Nixon announces the U.S. incursion into Cambodia during the Vietnam War in April 1970. Among the tapes and documents are conversations about the Vietnam War, Nixon's second inauguration, the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 and the first Watergate trial, according to a library statement. Tuesday's release is the 13th opening of Nixon White House tapes since 1980, the statement said. The new Nixon tapes and documents will be available on the Internet and in the Richard Nixon libraries in College Park, Maryland, and Yorba Linda, California. Nixon resigned August 9, 1974, over the Watergate scandal -- the first president to resign from office. President Ford pardoned Nixon the following month, saying it was necessary for the nation to heal after Watergate. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The Richard Nixon Presidential Library is set to provide access to roughly 154 hours of White House tape recordings and 30,000 pages of formerly classified documents. This event marks a monumental contribution towards the understanding of Nixon's presidency, and U.S. history in general, as it opens more material for scholarly and public investigation. These materials include discussions about pivotal events and decisions during Nixon's tenure. One such discussion pertains to the U.S. incursion into Cambodia during the Vietnam War, which was announced by Nixon himself in April 1970. The decisions and eventual outcomes of this particular incursion hold significant weight in the history of United States foreign affairs, giving researchers and historians an enlightening perspective on this era. The announcement also includes mentions of conversations touching on Nixon's second inauguration. As inauguration is an integral event in a President's term, these potential insights could provide a revealing look into the administrative and political landscape at the time, and the strategy involved in planning such an event. The collection includes dialogues related to milestone court decisions such as the Supreme Court's verdict on Roe v. Wade in 1973. This landmark judgement, which legally protected a woman's rights to abortion services, substantially transformed the landscape of reproductive rights in the U.S. These documents can give us a better grasp of the administration's position and its influence on such transformative judicial decisions. It becomes more intriguing when we learn that the materials provide data on the first Watergate trial, a scandal that is indelibly etched in U.S. history. President Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, following the Watergate scandal, making him the first U.S. president to resign from the office. His successor, President Ford, later pardoned Nixon in an effort to mend the national rift that Watergate caused. The released materials are part of the 13th opening of Nixon White House tapes since 1980. The access to such extensive primary source materials invariably enriches our understanding of the controversial yet influential presidency of Richard Nixon. The newly available Nixon tapes and documents can be accessed both online and at the Richard Nixon libraries in College Park, Maryland and Yorba Linda, California. Providing a more detailed account of the presidential life, actions, and decisions of Nixon, these materials will help historians, scholars, and the public alike to better contextualize Nixon's administration within the broader panorama of American history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below. Paragraph: Robert and Thomas are visiting an abandoned amusement park in Russia that is rumored to emit radiation due to the materials used in the rides. Robert visits the Ferris wheel and his Geiger counter clicks slowly. Thomas visits the merry go round and his Geiger counter begins to click rapidly. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person's Geiger count has less current running through it? Answer:","completion":"In the given paragraph, Robert's Geiger counter clicks slowly, while Thomas's Geiger counter clicks rapidly.

An analysis of each component of the phrase reveals that it is complimenting and applauding various aspects of Fontaine's directorial style. 1. \\"Fontaine's direction\\" – This implies that the speaker is focusing on the way Fontaine has orchestrated the film or project in question, indicating that the discussion is about Fontaine's directorial choices. 2. \\"Especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups\\" – This expresses highlight and praise for Fontaine's application of a specific film technique: close-ups. By terming these close-ups as 'agreeably startling,' it suggests that they are both surprising and pleasing to the viewer, and it was an impressive and innovative method to capture the audience's attention. This technique must have added more depth and intensity to the scenes, engaging the viewer more profoundly. 3. \\"Her grace with a moving camera\\" – Here, \\"grace\\" suggests efficiency, skill, and artfulness, illustrating appreciation towards how in-depth and well-handled the use of the so-called 'moving camera' is done during filming. The moving camera could refer to techniques like tracking shots, pans, tilts, hand-held shots, etc., creating a dynamic view that can artfully exhibit actions, shift viewer perspective, create tension, or indulge in detailed storytelling. By lauding Fontaine's 'grace,' it signifies that she maneuvered these techniques in a fluid, elegant, and well-crafted manner. 4. \\"Creates sheerly cinematic appeal\\" – This final remark underscores the whole point of the praise. It suggests that all these elements of direction – the surprising close-ups, the graceful moving-camera shots – contribute towards something that is 'cinetically appealing.' In other words, it's not only engaging to watch but also feel and experience. It's a commendation of making a movie not just visually, but also aesthetically pleasing, rewarding for the audience, and enriching for the cinematic art form. Hence, given all these points, the phrase can be interpreted as an endorsement or affirmation of Fontaine's directional prowess, indicating a positive opinion."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you are given a list.

Eric Pickles yesterday defended the intelligence services over the Woolwich terror attack, saying it is impossible to control everyone all the time. The Communities Secretary said: ‘We need to be realistic that a free and open society is always vulnerable.’ However, he made clear that David Cameron is demanding to know ‘what went wrong’ after it emerged that the two suspected terrorists were known to MI5. Questions: Police and security services have faced criticism over what they knew about the suspected killers of Drummer Lee Rigby. Balance: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said there were limits to intelligence controls in a free society while Richard Barrett, ex-head of counter-terrorism at MI6, said preventing attacks was incredibly hard. Government sources have revealed both suspects – Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale – appeared on lists of interest to the security services. Mr Pickles told the BBC: ‘Peers and MPs will do a thorough investigation in terms of what the security forces knew but I’ve seen experts on security explaining how difficult it is in a free society to be able to control everyone.’ He added: ‘The Prime Minister is very clear he wants to see an investigation about what went right and what went wrong. ‘It’s very important to stress these investigation are still going on.’ Terror suspect: Michael Adebolajo, who was filmed after Lee Rigby's killing with blood on his hands, was pictured (circled) at an Islamist demonstration in 2007 according to notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary (right) Victim: Lee Rigby, 25, was yesterday named as the victim of the Woolwich knife attack.

To do this, we need to add 1046 to both sides to eliminate the constant term on the right-hand side: 1024 + 1046 = -138*i 2070 = -138*i Now that we have isolated the variable 'i' on the right-hand side, we can solve for i by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of i, which is -138: 2070 / (-138) = -138*i / (-138) -15 = i So, the value of 'i' that satisfies the equation is i = -15."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: If I tell you that Changing the phase of a solid can be done by adding heat energy, and ask you the question \\"what can be done to a solid by adding heat energy?\\", is the correct answer \\"massive damage\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"massive damage\\". The term \\"massive damage\\" implies causing significant harm or destruction, which is not an accurate description of the process occurring when heat energy is added to a solid. The correct answer to the question, \\"What can be done to a solid by adding heat energy?\\" is that the heat energy can cause a change in the phase or state of the solid. When heat energy is added to a solid substance, the molecules or atoms gain kinetic energy, causing them to vibrate or move more rapidly. As the kinetic energy of the particles increases, they overcome the intermolecular or atomic forces that hold them together in the solid state. As a result, the substance undergoes a phase transition, changing from a solid to a liquid or possibly even directly to a gas, depending on the amount of heat energy added and the substance's properties. The process of a solid changing into a liquid upon heating is called melting, while the direct conversion of a solid into a gas is known as sublimation. When a solid melts into a liquid, the substance retains its chemical composition, but its physical properties, such as shape, density, and volume, can change. This is not a destructive process but rather a transformation. In summary, adding heat energy to a solid causes a change in its phase or state, which can result in melting or sublimation, depending on the properties of the substance and the conditions under which the process occurs. This transformation is not accurately described as \\"massive damage,\\" as it is a change in the physical state of the substance and is not destructive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OLD TOWN - the heart and soul of Key West and the place most visitors spend their time - is only one mile by two. The Crew's house by the cemetery was less than half a mile from where they'd last seen Winston. Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away. When they got there, Paul saw no sign of either Winston or Lily, so he assumed they were still inside the rundown shack that passed for a gallery. They parked a block away and approached at a brisk walk, Paul almost jogging to keep up with Chloe's excited strides. Winston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \\"The Life,\\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid. Paul, after defrauding his former partners and then running afoul of the law in a very public way, had been living The Life for almost a year and a half now. Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground. He not only led his own Crew, he was also in contact with dozens, maybe scores of other such groups all over the world, including Chloe and Paul's little Crew of four. On top of all that, he'd once taken a couple bullets while helping Paul out, so, like Chloe, Paul had a soft spot in his heart for the old man. They hadn't seen him since that bloody night, but Chloe had been in communication with him off and on over the last sixteen months. Winston and his Crew were old school and didn't trust much in the way of electronic communications. Mostly it had been encoded, hand-delivered letters and arcane classified ads in various newspapers. Chloe found this particular breed of paranoia on Winston's part annoying, but Paul admired it. Question: What is probably true about Paul? Options: A. not enough information B. He's a child C.

Article:","completion":"Title: From Victimhood to Empowerment: A Journey of Self-Love, Positivity, and Gratitude Introduction In a fast-paced, demanding world, it is all too easy to slip into the role of a victim—a mindset fixated on external obstacles and one's own weaknesses. By relinquishing control and responsibility, this perspective puts personal growth and happiness at the mercy of external factors. However, there is a powerful alternative: a mindset centered on self-love, positivity, and gratitude. By implementing effective strategies such as nurturing one's body, seeking social support, and turning to spirituality, it is possible to transform from a victim to a self-empowered individual. The following guide will provide a step-by-step roadmap for this journey. Step 1: Stop Playing the Role of Victim The first step in the process of self-empowerment is to recognize and break out of the victim mentality. This involves taking responsibility for one's own actions and choices, as well as acknowledging the power to change one's circumstances. Embrace the challenges and setbacks as opportunities for growth, instead of dwelling on them as insurmountable obstacles. Step 2: Kick Negative Self-Talk to the Curb Negative self-talk is a self-destructive thought pattern that can erode self-confidence and hinder personal growth. Recognize these thoughts and replace them with positive affirmations and self-compassionate reflections. By cultivating a more uplifting inner dialogue, you can combat negativity and build confidence in your abilities. Step 3: Love Yourself and Others Developing a strong sense of self-love is key to unlocking one's full potential. This involves appreciating oneself for both strengths and imperfections, striving for growth without being overly critical or demanding. Extend this love to others, by treating everyone with kindness, empathy, and understanding, which will help create a more fulfilling and compassionate environment. Step 4: Engage in Regular Activities You Love Make time for hobbies and interests that bring joy and passion into your life. These activities are not only ideal for self-expression but also serve as reminders of your talents and skills. Furthermore, engaging in activities you love can provide respite from daily stressors and enhance overall well-being. Step 5: Make Use of Social Support Relying on a strong network of friends and family for support and encouragement is crucial for personal growth and happiness. Sharing experiences, exchanging advice, or simply lending a listening ear is invaluable in navigating life's challenges. Don't hesitate to reach out to others when in need, and be willing to offer support in return. Step 6: Nurture Your Body A healthy body is the foundation for a healthy mind. Prioritizing physical wellness through exercise, nutritious meals, and sufficient sleep is essential for both mental and emotional well-being. Treat your body with love and care, recognizing that it is the vessel that carries you through your life's journey. Step 7: Be Grateful Cultivating gratitude is a powerful method of shifting focus away from negative thoughts and toward positive aspects of one's life. Acknowledge the blessings and opportunities around you, and consider adopting a gratitude practice, such as journaling or meditation, to transform your outlook on life. Step 8: Turn to Your Spirituality For many, spirituality offers guidance and emotional support in the face of adversity. Regardless of your faith or belief system, seeking solace and understanding through spiritual practices can foster inner strength and resilience. Conclusion Embracing a mindset of self-love, positivity, and gratitude is the key to overcoming the victim mentality and becoming a self-empowered individual. By following these steps, you can foster personal growth, inner strength, and ultimately, a happier, more fulfilling life. The journey may not always be easy, but it is undoubtedly worth the effort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A forest fire starts - The fire surrounds the vicinity - The animals are trapped - Those that survive have their habitat destroyed - The survivors must find a new habitat - Conflict with other animals occur. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose no people put the fire out happens, how will it affect a GREATER negative effect on animals. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"To answer the question, let's analyze the perturbation hypothesis step-by-step and examine its effects on the process. Perturbation Hypothesis: Suppose no people put the fire out happens. Step 1: A forest fire starts - The perturbation does not have a direct effect on the starting of the fire. However, given that no people will put out the fire, the fire will likely spread further and faster than if there were human intervention. Step 2: The fire surrounds the vicinity - With no human intervention, the fire will continue to spread and surround the area. This will affect more animals and extend across a larger area than if the fire were put out, or at least controlled. Step 3: The animals are trapped - As the fire engulfs the area faster due to lack of intervention, more animals will be unable to escape and will be trapped. The negative effect on animals increases as the chances of survival decrease. Step 4: Those that survive have their habitat destroyed - With no one to put the fire out, the spread of the fire will have a greater impact and damage a larger portion of the habitat. This leads to more significant habitat loss for surviving animals. Step 5: The survivors must find a new habitat - As a larger area has been affected and more extensive habitat loss has occurred, the surviving animals will face even more challenges in finding new habitats. This will increase competition for resources and create additional stress on the animals. Step 6: Conflict with other animals occurs - As more animals are forced to find a new habitat due to a more extensive fire, the chances of conflict between animals also increase. More significant habitat loss and displacement of species may lead to a ripple effect on ecosystem balance and functioning. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Due to the lack of human intervention in putting out the fire, the fire spreads faster and affects a larger area, which in turn leads to a greater negative effect on the involved animals and their habitats."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In the 1960s,[9] a young woman[9] nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the fictional Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, after she is blamed for her younger sister's death. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape.

Q:What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Cool\\" A:","completion":"Without any specific context or a detailed explanation about the experience or use of the product, service, or experience in the given review, it is difficult to assign a concrete ★-rating based solely on the word \\"Cool\\". Typically, product reviews are more nuanced and detailed. However, we could consider a number of approaches to possibly infer a rating from this review: 1. Positive Connotation Approach: Assuming that the word \\"Cool\\" is meant in a positive context — as it usually means something likable or agreeable — we can infer that this review implies a generally positive experience or perception. However, the lack of depth or enthusiasm might suggest it isn't the highest possible rating. In this case, the rating could be somewhere in the middle, around ★★★. 2. Effort Approach: Considering the effort put into writing the review, the brevity of it could suggest a lack of a strong feeling one way or another. The user wasn't motivated to write a detailed review, which might happen when somebody has an extremely positive (★★★★★) or negative (★) experience. So, in this case, we might infer a middle rating of ★★★. 3. Enthusiasm Approach: If we consider this single word to imply a level of simplicity, modernity, or trendiness, it could be perceived as a succinct but highly positive review. In that case, it might lean towards a ★★★★ or even ★★★★★. Given those possible approaches, note that any rating assigned would be a rough estimation, as the provided review \\"Cool\\" is quite vague. For a more precise rating, a more detailed review would be better. Assessing star ratings often requires comprehensive feedback, covering different aspects such as quality, usability, price, customer service (in case of a service), or the overall experience. In conclusion, with ambiguity in terms like \\"Cool\\", AI has limitations as it requires explicit context or additional information to make completely accurate judgments.

Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? Bill is likely John to hit.","completion":"The given sentence, \\"Bill is likely John to hit,\\" is neither syntactically nor semantically acceptable. Let's break down the sentence to understand the reasons behind this conclusion: 1. Syntactic acceptability: Syntactic acceptability refers to whether a sentence conforms to the rules of syntax, which govern the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence to create well-formed sentences in a specific language. In the case of the provided sentence, the syntax does not follow standard English word order or construction. A more appropriate way to arrange the sentence to convey the intended meaning would be: \\"Bill is likely to hit John.\\" This sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order found in English. The subject \\"Bill\\" is followed by the modal verb \\"is likely to\\" (indicating probability) and the verb \\"hit.\\" The object \\"John\\" comes after the verb, as expected in SVO word order. 2. Semantic acceptability: Semantic acceptability refers to whether a sentence makes sense in terms of meaning and logic. The sentence \\"Bill is likely John to hit\\" creates confusion about the intended meaning due to its incorrect syntax. While we can somewhat guess that the sentence aims to convey that Bill might hit John, the incorrect arrangement of words makes it unclear upon first reading. The sentence \\"Bill is likely to hit John\\" is semantically acceptable because it clearly conveys that there is a probability of Bill causing harm to John. In conclusion, the original sentence \\"Bill is likely John to hit\\" is neither syntactically nor semantically acceptable in its original form. To communicate the intended message more effectively in English, it is better to use the sentence \\"Bill is likely to hit John,\\" which is both syntactically and semantically acceptable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Before Stanton narrowed her political focus almost exclusively to women's rights, she was an active abolitionist together with her husband, Henry Brewster Stanton and cousin, Gerrit Smith . Question: what movement was elizabeth cady stanton a part of Answer:","completion":"Elizabeth Cady Stanton was a prominent figure in multiple movements throughout her life, most notably the women's rights and the abolitionist movements. 1. Women's Rights Movement: Elizabeth Cady Stanton is best known for her tireless efforts and leadership in the women's rights movement. In July 1848, she joined forces with Lucretia Mott and other like-minded women to organize the Seneca Falls Convention in Seneca Falls, New York. This gathering was the first-ever women's rights convention in the United States and marked the beginning of organized attempts to secure rights and opportunities for women. At the convention, Stanton drafted the Declaration of Sentiments, which drew heavily from the United States Declaration of Independence. The document outlined the civil, social, and political rights that women should have, including the right to vote. Stanton's pursuit of gender equality continued throughout her life, pushing for the passage of the 19th Amendment (granting women the right to vote). 2. Abolitionist Movement: Before narrowing her focus almost exclusively to women's rights, Elizabeth Cady Stanton was an active abolitionist. She was staunchly against slavery and joined her husband, Henry Brewster Stanton, and cousin, Gerrit Smith, in fighting for the emancipation and rights of enslaved individuals. Stanton frequently attended and spoke at abolitionist meetings, where she further developed her skills as an orator and made key connections with fellow activists such as Susan B. Anthony, whom she would later collaborate with on numerous women's rights initiatives. Although the women's rights and abolitionist movements were her primary areas of involvement, Elizabeth Cady Stanton also advocated for various social reforms, including temperance, better education, and improved divorce laws. Throughout her life, Stanton remained dedicated to social justice and equality, leaving a lasting impact on both the women's rights and abolitionist movements."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you are given a sentence in the Swedish language and your task is to convert it into the English language.

Written by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman, The Wipers Times is based on the true story of a satirical newspaper produced by soldiers in the trenches. Alongside Palin, the cast includes Ben Chaplin, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Steve Oram and Emilia Fox. The Monty Python star is now best known on TV for his travel series. Palin's last TV drama role was in Alan Bleasdale's GBH in 1991, in which he played a school headmaster intimidated by a newly-elected city council leader, played by Robert Lindsay. Palin said in a Bafta interview earlier this year that he considered the role one of his career highlights. In its official announcement on Tuesday, the BBC described The Wipers Times as \\"a story of the extraordinary resilience of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity\\". Ben Chaplin plays Captain Fred Roberts, who discovers a printing press in the bombed-out ruins of Belgian town Ypres in 1916 and uses it to publish The Wipers Times (named after the army slang for Ypres). The paper's subversive humour proves popular with soldiers on the front line but goes down less well with their superior officers. \\"Just like the original Wipers Times, this new history drama will be filled with jokes, spoofs and amazing examples of courage behind the laughs,\\" said Janice Hadlow, controller of BBC Two. As the war continued, the paper changed its name as the soldiers from the 12th Battalion Sherwood Foresters - who produced it - changed location. Its other titles included The Somme Times and, after the Armistice, The Better Times. Private Eye editor Ian Hislop and writing partner Nick Newman's other projects include BBC children's sitcom My Dad's the Prime Minister. The drama will be shown on BBC Two later this year.

Vastustamme Timothy McVeighin teloitusta, vaikka hän onkin murhaaja. Translate to English","completion":"We oppose Timothy McVeigh's execution, even though he is a murderer. It is important to elaborate on the possible reasons why someone might hold this position, as well as provide further context behind this statement. 1. Human rights argument: Some people fundamentally believe that no person should be subjected to the death penalty, regardless of the nature of their crime. They argue that it is a violation of an individual's right to life, dignity, and freedom from cruel and inhumane treatment. This perspective is based on the idea that every person, even criminals, has an inherent right to life. 2. Moral or ethical standpoint: Some people are morally opposed to the death penalty due to religious or ethical grounds. They believe that it is not ethical for humans, including the state or judicial system, to take another person's life. This might be based on various religious beliefs, advocating for forgiveness and justice rather than retribution. 3. Chance of wrongful execution: There is always the possibility that a person may be wrongfully convicted and executed, or that new evidence may come to light after the execution has taken place. Opponents of the death penalty argue that the irreversible nature of capital punishment is too definite a punishment to take the chance of accidental execution of innocent people. 4. Critique of the justice system: Some argue that the criminal justice system is flawed and may treat certain groups unfairly. As a result, not every accused person is given a fair trial or representation. This may result in unequal application of the death penalty. Moreover, studies have shown that economically disadvantaged people and racial minorities are more likely to receive the death penalty. 5. The question of deterrence: The deterrence argument claims that the death penalty prevents crime by intimidating would-be criminals, thus serving as an effective crime prevention measure. However, studies and statistical research have shown inconclusive results on the death penalty's ability to deter crime effectively. In comparing states or countries with and without capital punishment, it is often found that there are no significant differences in murder rates or other violent crime statistics. 6. Reformation and rehabilitation: Instead of focusing on harsh punishment, opponents of the death penalty may argue that it is more productive to focus on reforming and rehabilitating criminals. It is suggested that a criminal should not be executed but should instead have the opportunity to reform themselves in a correctional facility, potentially becoming a valuable member of society. In the specific case of Timothy McVeigh, who was executed in 2001 for his role in the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people, some opponents may argue that the above reasons still apply in this high-profile case. While his crimes were heinous and brought great suffering upon many, they may feel that the death penalty was still not the right response, and that it goes against the principles of human rights, morality, and the potential for rehabilitation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Their marriage was a mistake of World War II. And about 50 years ago, I was the only child I knew who didn't have a father at home on Father's Day. Divorce was very uncommon back then. So when my friends were in town shopping for presents for their fathers, I decided since my mother was both Mother and Father, no one else was like her, who better deserved(be worth) a present on Father's Day than her? I bought her a little set of tools, just a few things, hammer, pliers and screwdriver and a box to put all these things in. I got some ideas from my grandfather and named it Mother's Tool Box. She was excited, more at the thought of being cared for on Father's Day than of the present. She always said she liked her Father's Day memories better than the Mother's Day ones. It made her feel special -- and she was. I have noticed in the past few years, greeting cards are even made for \\"Mother on Father's Day\\". Ever since then, my mother has got cards on Father's Day.

Given the question: Article: There is a popular belief among parents that schools are no longer interested in spelling. No school I have ever taught in has ever ignored spelling or considered it unimportant as a basic skill. There are, however, different ideas about how to teach it, or how much priority it must be given over general language development and writing ability. The problem is how to encourage a child to express himself freely and confidently in writing without holding him back with the complexities of spelling. If spelling becomes the only focal point of his teacher's interest, clearly a bright child will be likely to \\"play safe\\". He will tend to write only words within his spelling range, choosing to avoid adventurous language. That's why teachers often encourage the early use of dictionaries and pay attention to content rather than technical ability. I was once shocked to read on the bottom of a sensitive piece of writing about a personal experience: \\"This work is terrible! There are far too many spelling errors and your writing is terrible.\\" It may have been a sharp criticism of the pupil's technical abilities in writing, but it was also a sad reflection on the teacher who had omitted to read the essay, which contained some beautiful expressions of the child's deep feelings. The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to the errors, but if his priorities had centered on the child's ideas, an expression of his disappointment with the presentation would have given the pupil more motivation to seek improvement. Question: Teachers encourage the use of dictionaries so that _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"students will be able to express their ideas more freely\\"? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"students will be able to express their ideas more freely.\\" Step 1: Read and understand the article and question. In the article, the author discusses the importance of spelling in schools, differing teaching methods, and how focusing too much on spelling can hinder a child's ability to express themselves creatively and confidently in writing. Step 2: Identify relevant information in the article. The author explains that teachers often encourage dictionary use because they want students to be able to focus on content and not just technical ability. Step 3: Answer the question based on the relevant information. \\"Teachers encourage the use of dictionaries so that students will be able to express their ideas more freely.\\" Step 4: Justify the answer by connecting it to the article. The article states that one of the issues with getting children to express themselves freely is the focus on spelling. By encouraging the use of dictionaries, teachers are trying to strike a balance between helping students improve their spelling while also allowing them to express their ideas and use adventurous language without fear of making mistakes. So, the answer \\"Yes\\" demonstrates that this approach aims to make students more capable of expressing their ideas freely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Many in Congress see F-22 as way of protecting defense industry jobs. Obama has threatened to veto legislation ordering more fighter jets. Article:","completion":"Title: President Obama Stands Firm Against F-22 Raptor Production: A Clash with Congress Looms Introduction: The U.S. President Barack Obama and Congress are on a collision course over the procurement of the advanced F-22 Raptor fighter jets. Despite opposition from both the President and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, many lawmakers continue to push for additional orders of the expensive aircraft, primarily in a bid to preserve jobs in the defense industry. Body: 1. Obama and Gates' stance on F-22 Raptor President Obama and Defense Secretary Gates have taken a firm stand against ordering any more of the 350 million fighter jets, arguing that the existing fleet is sufficient and that resources should be allocated to other vital defense programs. The administration's resistance against purchasing more F-22s represents a shift in national security priorities and a move towards more cost-effective solutions. 2. Congressional support for F-22 Raptor Despite the administration's position, several lawmakers in Congress have continued to advocate for additional F-22 fighter jets. Their primary motivation seems to be protecting defense industry jobs, as the jet's production involves numerous subcontractors and manufacturers spread across the U.S. The potential loss of employment in the defense sector has spurred many in Congress to support the continued production of the F-22 Raptor. 3. Obama's veto threat In response to congressional attempts to order more fighter jets, President Obama has threatened to veto any legislation mandating additional F-22 production. Such a veto would ensure that the administration's vision for more efficient and judicious defense spending is preserved, but could set the stage for a contentious relationship with Congress. 4. Implications of the clash The conflict between the President and Congress over the F-22 Raptor illustrates the complexity of national security policy decisions and the delicate balance between military preparedness and economic considerations. Ultimately, this battle over defense spending could have wider implications for U.S. national security priorities and the relationship between the executive branch and the legislature. Conclusion: As President Obama faces a battle with Congress over the procurement of new F-22 Raptor fighter jets, the decisions taken in this fraught conflict will have lasting effects on U.S. defense policy and the overall dynamic between the executive and legislative branches. While economic factors such as job preservation weigh heavily on the minds of lawmakers, the administration must carefully navigate the complex challenge of balancing fiscal responsibility with national security interests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans. With the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong (d. 107 AD), Emperor He (r. 88–105 AD) had Empress Dowager Dou (d. 97 AD) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother—Consort Liang—and then concealing her identity from him.

Monk has spoken with several of his new managerial colleagues in English football's top flight after landing a three-year contract at the Liberty Stadium. 'A lot of them said \\"welcome to the madhouse\\". In fact, pretty much every one of them has said that,' said Monk, who revealed via his Twitter account on Friday night that he had officially retired as a player. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Monk talk about the honour and privilege of managing Swansea. New recruit: Garry Monk is ready to join the Premier League 'madhouse' as permanent Swansea manager. 'I think the bottom line is, out of all the advice I have had, the most important bit is that they have just said be yourself, don't try and be something else. 'For me it has to be that way. You have to learn from what you have done, and that is what I am going to do. 'I have it clear in my mind what I want, and though I am not going to say it's going to be easy to get there, I will try to get there. 'For me, Tony Pulis (Crystal Palace manager) was one of the best I spoke to, to be honest. 'After the game (against Swansea) he came in and spoke. It was a proper manager speaking. He was very honest about his group and my group and the way they work, why they do it. I found it very interesting. 'There have been quite a few managers, and all of them I have spoken to have been good to me. They have been very supportive and encouraging.'

Adventurers: Napoli's Gonzalo Higuain celebrates their Europa League win over Swansea behind Ben Davies. Monk has been elevated from the head-coaching role he took on in early February after Swansea dispensed with Michael Laudrup's managerial services. During that time, despite a few setbacks in terms of results, he ultimately guided Swansea away from relegation danger and towards mid-table heading into Sunday's season finale at Sunderland. 'It hasn't really sunk in. All I have been thinking about is the games,' he added. 'Everything that happened in the week was great, but we've got a game on Sunday. I went home and I was just planning the training sessions for the next day and what I would say to the players regarding the Sunderland game. I didn't want to make it too much of a distraction to anyone else. 'Because it's not about me right now, it's about finishing the season, and I guess when I get to the summer I will probably reflect upon what has gone on and the magnitude of it.' For his part, Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins has no doubt about Monk's qualities. The Swans have a track record for getting managerial appointments right, as shown by former bosses like Roberto Martinez and Brendan Rodgers, and Jenkins feels that Monk is from a familiar mould. Pedigree: Former Swansea bosses Roberto Martinez and Brendan Rodgers now running Merseyside. 'Like every decision we make, whatever manager you bring in is a gamble. You only have to look to other Premier League clubs to see what has gone on to see that 10 or so managers have changed,\\" Jenkins said. 'That argument is completely overshadowed by the fact every club needs, first and foremost, good people you can work with and people you think will take on the challenge, and I think as always at our club look to build their experience and improve things and set their mark. 'The biggest qualities are commitment and a passion for the job and working for Swansea City with the way we want to work. He (Monk) has got the thirst to learn and grow in experience. 'The other side is every young manager in his position will make mistakes, like experienced managers do. You just hope while he's learning we still carry on and achieve success, That is all you can hope for. 'He has got ideas and thoughts of how he would like to implement some of the way we work in the backroom staff like other managers have, and I can see that growing as he gains in confidence as he goes along.'","completion":"Garry Monk is ready to join the Premier League 'madhouse' after being appointed as manager of Swansea.

He is able to sit up on his own, however, like any other baby, he does fall over in all directions. So, when I gave him this toy to play with he was very amused by it and was thoroughly enjoying it, especially being able to CHEW the rings. Then I noticed that he could fit the yellow cylinder (attached to the base that you stack the rings onto) all the way into his mouth. So I was concerned for his safety that if he fell forward he could lodge it into his throat and obstruct his airway. I have contacted fisher-price and they are picking up the toy from my house for a full refund. I think you should not buy this for a baby that doesn't sit completely stable on his/her own, maybe not until 8 or 9 months old.

In 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to record their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. The album included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, \\"Jugband Blues\\". Waters began to develop his own songwriting, contributing \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\", \\"Let There Be More Light\\" and \\"Corporal Clegg\\". Wright composed \\"See-Saw\\" and \\"Remember a Day\\". Norman Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on \\"Remember a Day\\", Smith stepped in as his replacement. Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, \\"Norman gave up on the second album ... he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise'\\". As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of the album's title track, they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking \\"like an architectural diagram\\".Released in June 1968, the album featured a psychedelic cover designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The first of several Pink Floyd album covers designed by Hipgnosis, it was the second time that EMI permitted one of their groups to contract designers for an album jacket. The release peaked at number 9, spending 11 weeks on the UK chart. Record Mirror gave the album an overall favourable review, but urged listeners to \\"forget it as background music to a party\\". John Peel described a live performance of the title track as \\"like a religious experience\\", while NME described the song as \\"long and boring ...

When garnished with onion, a martini is called a Gibson martini. Use small pearl onions, which are often marketed for cocktails. They usually come in a jar and are often pickled in brine. If you’re in a pinch, try garnishing with a slice of regular white or sweet onion, but remember that it might not quite give you the taste you are hoping for. Onions are sometimes pickled with paprika or turmeric, along with the pickling brine. If you have onions that are adding too much of the wrong kind of flavor to your drink, rinse them off quickly with cold water. Keep in mind that rinsing them will take away some of the flavor, so only do it if you feel it’s absolutely necessary. You have the choice to skewer the onions or place them directly in the drink. Ask the drinker which they prefer. Rest the toothpick against the side of the cocktail glass when you serve the drink. The skewer is convenient because it allows the drinker to easily pull the onion out of the drink if they want to eat it.

In the context of the European Commission's Green Paper, a dialogue has been launched to address the impact of the digital age and globalization on the cultural and creative industries. As technology continues to advance and reshape the way we live, work, and interact, various industries are forced to adapt and evolve to stay relevant and competitive in the global market. The digital age has brought about numerous innovations and opportunities for growth in various sectors, including the cultural and creative industries. However, it has also presented new challenges, such as the protection of intellectual property rights, ensuring fair remuneration for creators, and maintaining cultural diversity in the face of global conglomerates and monopolistic competition. Globalization has further intensified these challenges. As the exchange of goods, services, information, and ideas become increasingly borderless, the cultural and creative industries are confronted with both an expanding potential audience and fierce competition from across the globe. This situation demands constant innovation and adaptation, as well as the development and implementation of effective strategies to preserve and promote the uniqueness of each cultural and creative industry. In response to these challenges, the European Commission's Green Paper aims to facilitate a comprehensive and constructive discussion on the current state of the cultural and creative industries in the digital age and the effects of globalization. By engaging various stakeholders, such as artists, creators, policymakers, and business representatives, the dialogue seeks to identify the key issues and challenges faced by these industries. It also aspires to develop appropriate frameworks, policies, and strategies to support their growth and competitiveness, while safeguarding the cultural values and diversity that makes them unique. Overall, the initiative taken by the European Commission through its Green Paper serves as an essential platform for addressing the pressing issues and challenges faced by the cultural and creative industries in today's rapidly globalizing and digitizing world.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"prokaryotes. Viruses are infectious agents that can only replicate inside the living cells of a host organism. They are known to infect a wide range of organisms, including animals, plants, and microorganisms such as bacteria. However, based on the given choices, we can select the most fitting answer. Bacteria are classified as prokaryotes because they have simple cell structures, lacking a clearly defined nucleus and sub-cellular organelles found in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes are the most ancient and diverse group of organisms on Earth, and they are ubiquitous in the environment. Among the answer choices provided, \\"prokaryotes\\" is the best match for the organisms that viruses often infect. This is in line with the understanding that many viruses, called bacteriophages, specifically target bacteria. Bacteriophages play a crucial role in regulating bacterial populations and have been studied extensively for their potential in treating bacterial infections. While the other answer choices listed—mammals, insects, and the skin—do include organisms or tissues that can be infected by viruses, they are not as encompassing or precise as the term \\"prokaryotes.\\" Mammals and insects are both types of eukaryotes, which have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the information you found is correct regarding the conversion of vitamin D in the liver to calcidiol (25(OH)D). However, it does not fully address the question of where vitamin D is found. Vitamin D is found in three main sources: 1. Sunlight: Our skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from the sun. This is the most natural way to obtain vitamin D. 2. Food: Vitamin D can be found in a limited number of foods, including fatty fish (such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel), fish liver oils, beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks. Some mushrooms, like maitake and shiitake, also contain vitamin D. Additionally, certain foods are fortified with vitamin D, such as milk, orange juice, and breakfast cereals. 3. Supplements: Vitamin D supplements are available in the form of capsules, tablets, or liquid drops. They can help improve vitamin D levels in individuals who do not get enough sunlight exposure, have difficulty absorbing the vitamin from the food they eat, or have certain medical conditions. In summary, vitamin D is synthesized in the skin when exposed to sunlight, found in certain foods, and available in supplement form.

A widower with a 12 year old daughter, Elspeth (Janette Scott), Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale (Marlene Dietrich), a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's port undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly, damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.

As Lady Jean sends her inside to change, Peter comments to her how Linet is growing up and shows no fear. They then talk about how when her husband, Lord Percival, was in the castle, there was no danger. But since Percival's disappearance, his evil twin brother, Lord Godfrey, has taken over, and no one in the castle is safe, which is why Jean and Linet live in the country. As Jean stands, she suddenly sees Godfrey approaching, and Peter leaves. Godfrey notes to Jean that today was the day her husband went off to war, and it has been seven years since, meaning that she is legally free to remarry. He sternly implores that it is the right thing for Jean to marry him, but Jean flatly refuses and explains she still loves Percival.

Movie title: Dragonheart Context: An English knight, Bowen (Dennis Quaid), mentors a Saxon prince, Einon (Lee Oakes), in the Old Code, the ideals of chivalry in the hope that he will become a better king than his tyrannical father Freyne (Peter Hric). When the king is killed while suppressing a peasant rebellion, Einon is mortally wounded by the peasant girl Kara (Sandra Kovacikova). Einon's mother, Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie), has him taken before a dragon whom she implores to save the boy's life. The dragon replaces Einon's wounded heart with half of its own on the promise that Einon will rule with justice and virtue. However, Einon soon becomes more tyrannical than his father, enslaving the former rebels and forcing them to rebuild a Roman castle. Bowen believes that the dragon's heart has twisted Einon, and swears vengeance on all dragons. Twelve years later, an adult Einon (David Thewlis) has his castle rebuilt. Kara (Dina Meyer) asks the king for pardoning her father after years of slavery, but Einon instead kills him in order to \\"free\\" him. As for Bowen, he has become a very skilled dragonslayer. Brother Gilbert (Pete Postlethwaite), a monk and aspiring poet, observes Bowen slaying a dragon and follows him to record his exploits. Bowen stalks another dragon (voiced by Sean Connery) to its cave, however the confrontation ends in a stalemate. The dragon states that he is the last of his kind, and thus if Bowen kills him, he will be out of a job. The two form a partnership to defraud local villagers with staged dragonslayings. Bowen calls the dragon Draco, after the constellation. Unknown to Bowen, Draco is the dragon who shared his heart with Einon, and through this connection, any pain inflicted upon one is also felt by the other.

The new wave of diplomats often came from those programs. Archaeology on the international scene, although very much of intellectual interest to the major universities, fell into the shadow of international relations. Their domain became the Ancient Near East, which could no longer be relied upon to be the Near East. The Ottoman Empire was gone, along with all the other empires of the 19th century, replaced with independent republics. Someone had to reconcile the present with the past.

Context: Hoping to rebound from their loss at New England, the Broncos traveled to Qualcomm Stadium for an AFC West duel with the San Diego Chargers on Monday Night Football. The Chargers jumped out to a 10-0 lead in the first quarter, with a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Nick Novak, followed by a 15-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Philip Rivers to tight end Antonio Gates. Both scores came off Broncos' miscues on special teams&#8212;the former occurred after Trindon Holliday muffed a punt return, while the latter occurred after Omar Bolden coughed up the football on a kickoff return. The Broncos were attempting to narrow the Chargers' lead midway through the second quarter, but wide receiver Eric Decker stumbled near the Chargers' 30-yard line when it appeared that he was headed to the end zone for an easy touchdown, after receiving a 55-yard pass from quarterback Peyton Manning. Three plays later, Manning threw an interception that was returned by Chargers' cornerback Quentin Jammer 80 yards for a touchdown. The Chargers increased their lead to 24-0 just before halftime, with Rivers connecting on an 11-yard touchdown pass to Gates. The Broncos then staged one of the most memorable comebacks in Monday Night Football history. On the opening drive of the second half, Manning led the Broncos on an 8-play, 85-yard drive, culminating with a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. On the Chargers' next possession, Broncos' defensive end Elvis Dumervil forced a fumble off Rivers, and cornerback Tony Carter scooped up the football and returned it 65 yards for a touchdown. After the Broncos' defense forced a three-and-out, Manning hooked up with Decker on a 7-yard touchdown pass to pull the Broncos within 24-21 early in the fourth quarter. On the Chargers' next possession, Carter picked off Rivers, and four plays later, Manning tossed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Stokley to give the Broncos a 28-24 lead with 9:09 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Chargers were attempting to rally, but Rivers was intercepted by cornerback Chris Harris, Jr. with 6:54 remaining. However, the Broncos were forced to punt seven plays later, giving the Chargers' offense the football with four minutes remaining.

Q:This article: Even in his own homeland the general public was slow to recognise Smetana. As a young composer and pianist he was well regarded in Prague musical circles, and had the approval of Liszt, Proksch and others, but the public's lack of acknowledgement was a principal factor behind his self-imposed exile in Sweden. After his return he was not taken particularly seriously, and was hard put to get audiences for his new works, hence his \\"prophet without honour\\" remark after the nearly empty hall and indifferent reception of Richard III and Wallenstein's Camp at Žofín Island in January 1862.Smetana's first noteworthy public success was his initial opera The Brandenburgers in Bohemia, in 1866 when he was already 42 years old. His second opera, The Bartered Bride, survived the unfortunate mistiming of its opening night and became an enduring popular triumph. The different style of his third opera, Dalibor, closer to that of Wagnerian music drama, was not readily understood by the public and was condemned by critics who believed that Czech opera should be based on folk-song. It disappeared from the repertory after only a handful of performances. Thereafter the machinations that accompanied Smetana's tenure as Provisional Theatre conductor restricted his creative output until 1874. In his final decade, the most fruitful of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition. Of his later operas, The Two Widows and The Secret were warmly received, while The Kiss was greeted by an \\"overwhelming ovation\\". The ceremonial opera Libuše was received with thunderous applause for the composer; by this time (1881) the disputes around his music had declined, and the public was ready to honour him as the founder of Czech music. Nevertheless, the first few performances in October 1882 of an evidently under-rehearsed The Devil's Wall were chaotic, and the composer was left feeling \\"dishonoured and dispirited.\\" This disappointment was swiftly mitigated by the acclaim... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was left feeling dishonoured and dispirited?, what is it ?

During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world.

Background: Stereolab were an English-French avant-pop band from London, formed in 1990 by Tim Gane (guitar/keyboards) and Laetitia Sadier (vocals/keyboards/guitar) who both remained at the songwriting helm across many line-up changes. Other long-time members included Mary Hansen (backing vocals/keyboards/guitar), who joined in 1992 and remained in the line-up until her accidental death in 2002, and Andy Ramsay (drums), who joined in 1993 and is still in the official line-up. Sean O'Hagan of the High Llamas was a member from 1993 to 1994, and continued appearing on later records for occasional guest appearances. The group's music combined influences from krautrock, lounge and 1960s pop music. Context: Stereolab's music is politically and philosophically charged. Laetitia Sadier, who writes the group's lyrics, said that her inspiration was most recently her anger towards the Iraq War. The Surrealist and Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as noted by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 Salon.com interview. Stewart Mason commented in an AllMusic review that the lyrics from the 1997 song \\"Miss Modular\\" \\"sound influenced by the Situationist theory of the 'spectacle'.\\" Critics have noted Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than \\"affairs of the heart\\". \\"Ping Pong\\", a 1994 single included on the album Mars Audiac Quintet, was noted for its alleged Marxist lyrics. In the song, Sadier sings \\"about capitalism's cruel cycles of slump and recovery\\" with lyrics that constitute \\"a plainspoken explanation of one of the central tenets of Marxian economic analysis\\" (said critics Simon Reynolds and Stewart Mason, respectively). Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that \\"none of us are Marxists ... I've never even read Marx.\\" Gane said that although Sadier's lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into \\"sloganeering\\". Sadier also said that she had read very little Marx. In contrast, Cornelius Castoriadis, a radical political philosopher but strong critic of Marxism, has been cited as a marking influence in Sadier's thinking. The name of her side project, Monade, and its debut album title, Socialisme ou Barbarie, are also references to the work of Castoriadis. Stereolab's album and song titles occasionally reference avant-garde political groups and artists. Gane said that the title of their 1999 album Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night contains the names of two Surrealist organisations, \\"CoBrA\\" and \\"Phases Group\\", \\"Brakhage\\", the title of the first song on the 1997 album Dots and Loops, is a nod to experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage. Other examples are the 1992 compilation Switched On, named after Wendy Carlos' 1968 album Switched on Bach, and the 1992 single \\"John Cage Bubblegum\\", named after experimental composer John Cage. Question: what was special about the lyrics? Answer:","completion":"The lyrics of Stereolab's music were special due to several unique aspects: 1. Politically and philosophically charged content: Unlike many of their contemporaries, Stereolab's lyrics were deeply infused with political and philosophical messages, emphasizing societal issues and critiques. Laetitia Sadier's inspiration ranged from anger towards events like the Iraq War to cultural and political movements like Surrealism and Situationism. 2. Situationist theory and the concept of the 'spectacle': Several songs, like \\"Miss Modular,\\" touched upon themes rooted in Situationist theory, which emphasizes the role of the 'spectacle' in modern society - a critical examination of the consumerist culture and the way it shapes perceptions of reality. 3. Marxist allusions: Critics often found Marxist references in Stereolab's lyrics, leading to the perception that the band members themselves were Marxists. Songs like \\"Ping Pong\\" showcased lyrics that seemed to analyze the dynamics of capitalism through a Marxist lens. 4. Resistance to labeling and intellectual diversity: Despite the Marxist allusions, Stereolab's members resisted attempts to label them or their music as explicitly Marxist. They acknowledged the presence of political themes but emphasized the importance of avoiding simplistic \\"sloganeering.\\" Instead, their influences came from a diverse array of thinkers like Cornelius Castoriadis, a radical political philosopher critical of Marxism. 5. References to avant-garde political groups and artists: Stereolab's album and song titles often paid homage to avant-garde political organizations and artists. For example, the title of their 1999 album, \\"Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night,\\" contains the names of two Surrealist organizations, \\"CoBrA\\" and \\"Phases Group.\\" Other examples include references to experimental filmmakers like Stan Brakhage and composers like John Cage, showcasing the band's deep connection to the broader cultural context of their work. In conclusion, Stereolab's lyrics were special due to their politically and philosophically charged content, intellectual diversity, allusions to various political theories, and connections to cutting-edge artists and cultural movements. Their unique lyrical approach allowed them to stand out in the landscape of avant-pop music and made their work an enduring part of the genre's history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Starter Edwin Jackson shows some of best stuff Washington Nationals starter Edwin Jackson walked the first batter he faced on Friday night. The third batter doubled, and the cleanup hitter singled in a run. It was hardly a way to begin what would become among Jackson’s most commanding starts this season, yet that’s exactly how it ended when he left the game after eight innings and 95 pitches during a 2-1 loss to the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night at Nationals Park. During five of his final seven innings, Jackson retired the side in order. He finished with eight strikeouts, allowed five hits and walked one in lowering his ERA to 3.31 before watching reliever Ryan Mattheus surrender an 11th inning homer to Nick Markakis that was the difference. “I was just able to come out and locate pitches when I needed to,” Jackson said. “Having great defense behind you, it always makes the game a little easier.” The offensive support, however, was virtually non-existent behind Jackson, who has no-decisions in six of eight starts this season. He’s yielded three runs or fewer in five of those outings, and he’s pitched at least five innings in every start. In the Nationals most recent trip, Jackson started twice and left each game with the lead. Washington was one out from winning each time but gave up game-ending homers. “Like I said a thousand times, offense comes and goes,” Jackson said when asked about his teammates’ lack of production. “More times than not, if we keep pitching the way we’re pitching, we’ll win more games. Theses guys here, they practice real hard, and everybody’s out there having the best ABs they can.” The Nationals managed one extra-base hit against the Orioles, that coming on Ian Desmond’s sixth-inning homer to tie the score at 1. It was the sixth time this season Washington has scored one run or been shutout. This latest case of offensive failure comes with the Nationals missing several starters who potent bats, including outfielder Michael Morse, and right fielder Jayson Werth. “Through nine innings or so, I think we hit one ball hard,” Manager Davey Johnson said. “We had chances. A game like that’s frustrating. That was a tough one. [Jackson] pitched good. I thought the bullpen pitched good. One pitch, ballgame.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Starter Edwin Jackson delivered one of his most commanding starts this season for the Washington Nationals, despite a 2-1 loss to the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night.

And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job.

A local veterans group in Concord said the note left on Hayes' car is disrespectful and sickening. \\"There's no reason for something like this that gives everybody a bad name,\\" Ken Bratton, a veteran, said. Workers at the Harris Teeter apologized to Hayes on behalf of the person who wrote the note. Harris Teeter released the following statement: Harris Teeter is proud to support our country’s troops and veterans. The company introduced “Reserved for Veterans” parking spaces in October 2014 as a special way to say “thank you” to our veterans, and we love the positive feedback our shoppers often share with us about these spaces. It is unfortunate anyone would receive a note like this, and we are certainly disappointed it happened while this veteran was shopping in our store. We have reached out to Rebecca directly to thank her for her service as well as invite her to our Coddle Creek Harris Teeter this Friday, so we can offer a small token of our appreciation. If she is available to join us, I would like to invite you, too, Joe (Bruno.) We will have USO-NC President John Falkenbury on hand to speak about the importance of supporting our troops and veterans as well as offer a token of appreciation to our shopper. I would also like to mention that Harris Teeter just completed its Support Our Troops donation card campaign on May 31. Our generous shoppers and associates helped us raise nearly 800,000 in just 30 days to support our troops, veterans and their families. One hundred percent of all funds collected during Support Our Troops will be donated to local USO chapters throughout the areas in which Harris Teeter does business.

But some businesses take it a bit further with designated parking for other members of the community, such as expectant mothers and veterans. A Concord woman parked in one of those spots Monday at the Coddle Creek Harris Teeter in Concord. When she returned from shopping, she found a note on her vehicle that read, \\"This parking is for veterans, lady. Learn to read & have some respect.\\" That woman, Rebecca Landis Hayes, took to Facebook to respond to the anonymous note writer: To the person who left this note on my windshield today at the Coddle Creek Harris Teeter in Concord, NC: I know I parked in one of the Veteran Parking spaces today, it was hot.

Copyright 2016 WCNC ||||| Notice You must log in to continue. ||||| What was meant to be a scathing note in support of the troops left on a windshield ended up just being a sexist and incorrect rant. Anyone who has ever struggled to find an open parking space on a hot day can understand the frustration and temptation to grab a specialized spot. Especially if you need to run in for just a minute. But when Rebecca Landis Hayes decided to park in the veterans only parking spot at Coddle Creek Harris Teeter in Concord, North Carolina, on Monday, she was fully entitled to do so because she served in the United States Navy for eight years. However, when Hayes returned to her vehicle after leaving the store, she found a note on her windshield, shaming her for parking in the dedicated spot. \\"This parking is for Veterans, lady. Learn to read and have some respect,\\" the note read. So Hayes posted a photo of the note to Facebook, and wrote a response to the person who left it on her windshield.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

Using an AI translation model like Google Translate or DeepL, I'll get the following translation: \\"RT @EnricMillo: @3gerardpique Don't defame my name man .., I have never insulted you.\\" Given this translation, I can now attempt to assign it to one of the three categories: Against, Favor, or Neutral. Step 2: Analyze the stance of the tweet. The statement appears to be a personal comment aimed at another user, rather than an expression of opinion about Catalonia's independence. It does not criticize Catalonia's independence (Against), nor does it support it (Favor), and it is not merely stating information or news. Therefore, the next step will be Step 3: Assign the tweet to the 'Neutral' category. Since the tweet isn't explicitly supporting or opposing the idea of Catalonia's independence, it could be categorized as 'Neutral'. This is consistent with the definition provided, where a 'Neutral' tweet \\"states information or news rather than stating opinion.\\" Justifying these steps, it's vital to consider that linguistic and cultural nuances can often make it challenging to determine the stance of a text.

Rather, it is Lord Voldemort, otherwise known as Tom Marvolo Riddle, who is the main antagonist. Lord Voldemort is an extremely powerful and dangerous Dark Wizard. He was considered by many, including Albus Dumbledore and Harry himself, to be the most dangerous Dark Wizard in history, surpassing even Gellert Grindelwald. Such was the fear Voldemort inspired, that most witches and wizards dared not utter his name, instead referring to him with such monikers as \\"You-Know-Who,\\" \\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,\\" or \\"The Dark Lord.\\" This fear is so pervasive that it extends to the magical community’s everyday life, causing them to shy away from even mentioning his name. In part, it could be seen as people attempting to control their own fear, as giving a villain a name can give the illusion of making them real or empowering them further. Only a handful of characters, notably Harry Potter himself and Albus Dumbledore, Professor of Hogwarts School, have the courage to address Voldemort by his name. Dumbledore in particular emphasized the danger in giving too much power to fear, noteably reminding others that 'fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.' Harry Potter, the series' titular character, is often known as \\"The Boy Who Lived\\", because he survived an attempted murder by Voldemort as an infant — an act that led to Voldemort's first downfall, due to the powerful protection left by his mother's sacrifice. Consequently, while Harry Potter’s name has significance, emotions, and weight of its own within the series, and can be powerful to say and hear, it is not considered a name to be feared or avoided. Instead, it is Voldemort's name that is seen as one that cannot, or should not, be said."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The English word God and its counterparts in other languages are normally used for any and all conceptions and, in spite of significant differences between religions, the term remains an English translation common to all. The same holds for Hebrew El, but in Judaism, God is also given a proper name, the tetragrammaton YHWH, in origin possibly the name of an Edomite or Midianite deity, Yahweh.

Most of us have a favorite toy from childhood that still has the power to make us smile, whether it's a Barbie doll, a Micro Machine or the board game Operation. What makes them memorable is the subject of a new book, \\"Toy Time! From Hula Hoops to He-Man to Hungry Hungry Hippos,\\" a collection of some of the most beloved toys of the 20th century. Author Christopher Byrne crowd-sourced the compilation from readers of the popular website TimetoPlayMag.com and came up with more than 100 beloved toys. The book includes not just the most popular choices, such as Big Wheels and the Etch a Sketch, but also those that prompted the most compelling memories, serving as \\"a catalyst for the imagination,\\" Byrne said. Most of our favorite toys came into our lives when we were developing our identity and figuring out the world, he said. Some, like the rampaging dinosaur King Zor (1962), have faded from the cultural landscape, while others, like View-Master and Nok Hockey (which both hit the mass market in the 1940s), have been passed down through generations. The toys that stick with us are those that allowed us to explore new worlds and create experiences. \\"Ultimately, play is something that happens in the imagination,\\" said Byrne, content director of TimetoPlayMag.com. \\"What makes each Barbie doll unique is how a little girl creates and projects her sense of self and her fantasies onto that piece of plastic.\\" Other toys create strong memories simply because of their nostalgic appeal. \\"Some, just by looking at them, reflect the design sensibility of the time, becoming almost works of art,\\" he said. \\"We identify with them in the cultural context of their time.\\" So, how can you tell if a toy will be a hit for your child? When it comes to gift-giving for children, the most important rule of thumb is to know who you're shopping for, Byrne said. \\"The hot toys are only hot if they're hot for your child,\\" he said. \\"The toys that become memorable are the ones that connect with our interests.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1. The new book \\"Toy Time! From Hula Hoops to He-Man to Hungry Hungry Hippos\\" collects memories of the most beloved toys from the 20th century. The author, Christopher Byrne, sourced information from readers of TimetoPlayMag.com and included over 100 popular toys in the compilation. 2. Toys featured in the book include popular favorites like Big Wheels and the Etch a Sketch, as well as toys that incited compelling memories. Some once-popular toys like the dinosaur 'King Zor' have faded with time, while others like View-Master and Nok Hockey have been shared across generations. 3. The most memorable toys are often those which enabled children to explore new worlds and create unique experiences. It's not just the toys themselves but what a child imagines and projects onto them that makes them unique, e.g. a Barbie doll. 4. To find a toy that will likely be memorable for a child, it is crucial to match the toy with the child's interests and personality. Popular \\"hot\\" toys may not necessarily be the best choice if they do not resonate with a specific child. 5. Toys also evoke nostalgia and serve as a reflection of design sensibilities and the cultural context of their time, making them almost like works of art. This connection to their era forms an integral part of their appeal and the memories they create."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He gets a bucket of water and says to him \\"I bet i can turn this bucket upside down and no water will fall out\\". His brother doesn't believe him of course. So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle. But I can use this background: Centripetal force is, simply, the force that causes centripetal acceleration. Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain. What is an answer for this question: Given Adam stops swinging the bucket, will its centripetal acceleration increase or decrease? The answer is:","completion":"If Adam stops swinging the bucket, its centripetal acceleration will decrease to zero. This is because centripetal acceleration is directly related to centripetal force, which keeps the water in the bucket while it's spinning. When Adam stops spinning the bucket, the centripetal force is no longer acting upon the water, causing the centripetal acceleration to decrease."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Patricia eventually had to have an artificial hip put in, unlike Rachel, because","completion":"Patricia eventually had to have an artificial hip put in, unlike Rachel, because her worsening hip joint arthritis became too severe to manage with non-surgical interventions. This decision was made after assessing Patricia's quality of life, level of pain, and her ability to engage in daily activities. Over time, the cartilage in Patricia's hip joint had worn down significantly due to prolonged wear and tear, causing bones to grind against each other, which led to chronic pain and stiffness. This is in contrast to Rachel, whose hip arthritis remained within a manageable scope with minimal impact on her daily life. Several factors contributed to Patricia's case becoming significantly severe than Rachel's. Age played a major role in the progression of hip joint arthritis in Patricia's case, as the chances of developing osteoarthritis – the most common form of hip arthritis – increases as one gets older. Furthermore, Patricia had an elevated body mass index (BMI) – a condition that put additional stress on her hip joint, exacerbating her arthritis and causing the cartilage to degrade more rapidly. Conversely, Rachel maintained a healthy weight and was more proactive in her management of arthritis by engaging in regular exercise, which helped to strengthen the muscles around the hip joint, thus providing better support and reducing joint stress. Another factor that set Patricia's situation apart from Rachel's was her genetic predisposition to developing hip joint arthritis. Patricia had a family history of arthritis, with several close family members also having experienced similar joint issues, suggesting that she might have had an increased susceptibility to this degenerative condition. On the other hand, Rachel's family history did not indicate any predisposition to developing arthritis, allowing her to maintain relatively good hip joint health as she aged. Moreover, Patricia experienced a serious hip joint injury years prior to developing arthritis. This injury caused damage to the joint's cartilage and underlying bone structure, leading to a higher likelihood of developing arthritis in the affected joint later in life. Rachel, however, had never sustained any hip injuries, giving her joint a better chance of staying healthy as she aged. Before resorting to a hip replacement surgery, Patricia tried various non-invasive treatments to alleviate her pain and improve her joint function, which included pain-relief medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. Though these treatments were somewhat helpful initially, their effects gradually diminished as Patricia's hip joint condition deteriorated. In contrast, Rachel was able to successfully manage her milder hip arthritis symptoms through these non-invasive approaches. She employed a combination of medication, exercise, and weight management measures to alleviate her pain, reduce inflammation, and preserve her joint function. These measures allowed Rachel to stave off the need for artificial hip replacement surgery, at least for the foreseeable future. As a result, Patricia underwent a total hip replacement surgery to address the debilitating pain and loss of function she experienced in her hip joint. During this procedure, the damaged hip joint was replaced with an artificial joint made of metal, plastic, or ceramic components that mimic the natural movement of the joint. The surgery proved to be a success, as Patricia experienced significant pain relief, improved mobility, and an overall enhancement in her quality of life. Patricia eventually had to have an artificial hip put in, unlike Rachel, because her arthritis had become too severe and the benefits of surgery vastly outweighed the risks, providing her with a much-needed opportunity to regain a sense of normalcy in her day-to-day life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The duo who created \\"The Bedsit Tapes\\" came to prominence in the 1980s. The Bedsit Tapes refers to a collection of recordings made in a bedsit—an apartment typically consisting of one room that serves as a bedroom, living room, and kitchen. These recordings featured various musical styles such as experimental, electronic, post-punk, and indie pop and were made by the musical duo that gained popularity during this decade. The 1980s was a time of rapid change and innovation, both politically and culturally. The decade saw the rise of alternative music genres like post-punk, new wave, and electronic music as well as the continued popularity of mainstream genres like pop and rock. The decade was characterized by the rise of music videos, the introduction of the compact disc, and increasingly sophisticated production techniques. In turn, this period gave rise to a wealth of new artists and bands exploring new sounds and ideas. One important factor contributing to the independent music scene of the 1980s was the advent of affordable home recording equipment, including four-track cassette recorders, which enabled budding musicians to experiment and create music without the need for costly studio time. This accessibility allowed a range of bedroom musicians, such as the duo behind The Bedsit Tapes, to record and distribute their music to a broader audience, often through self-produced cassettes or via independent record labels, which grew rapidly in number during the decade. The duo who created The Bedsit Tapes demonstrated a spirit of independence and a desire to create music outside the constraints of the mainstream music industry. Their tapes showcased an eclectic mix of sounds and genres, reflecting the vibrant and diverse musical environment of the 1980s. By embracing home recording and making their work available to a growing audience, this creative duo managed to capture the attention of both music lovers and critics alike, ultimately leaving an indelible mark on the cultural landscape of the decade."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But following a crackdown on anti-government protestors that left at least 32 people dead the European Tour has decided to drop Bahrain from the schedule, for now at least. \\"With work still ongoing to resolve issues in Bahrain and the need to confirm the venue by the end of July 2011, the difficult decision to postpone the event for 2012 was taken,\\" the Tour said in a statement. But Bahrain would, it confirmed, remain on its roster. \\"We know that Bahrain is working hard to address the issues it has faced in recent months, as well as to reach out to the international community,\\" said George O'Grady from the European Tour. \\"We, together with the European Tour players, look forward to returning and building on that first, very successful, event in the future.\\" The postponement of next January's tournament will be seen as another blow to a Bahrain government keen to show the world that stability has returned to the island following months of anti-government unrest. In June motor sport's governing body, the FIA, cancelled Bahrain's 2011 F1 Grand Prix amid security fears. Red Bull's Australian driver Mark Webber raised ethical concerns about hosting a major sporting event in the Kingdom. \\"In my personal opinion, the sport should have taken a much firmer stance earlier this year rather than constantly delaying its decision in the hope of being able to reschedule it in 2011,\\" Webber wrote on his personal web site in June. \\"It would have sent a very clear message about F1's position on something as fundamental as human rights and how it deals with moral issues.\\" FIFA has also asked the Bahraini authorities to explain the jailing of several national football team players. Alaa Hubail, a striker who played 52 times for his country, was sentenced to two years in prison for his involvement in \\"illegal protests\\". A spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the sentences being handed down to protestors. \\"There are serious concerns that the due process rights of the defendants, many of whom are well-known human rights defenders, were not respected and the trials appear to bear the marks of political persecution,\\" said Ravina Shamdasani. When asked by CNN about the arrest of the footballers the Bahraini FA confirmed several had been arrested, but claimed they had been treated fairly according to the law. \\"The players have been arrested, investigated and detained for having opposed the general laws and bylaws of the country,\\" the vice-president of the Bahraini Football Association, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa al Khalifa, told CNN back in June before Hubail's sentence was handed down. \\"The fact that they happen to be footballers and national team players is highly irrelevant.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article are as follows: 1.

Summarize: Moise Katumbi urged President Joseph Kabila to stick to the constitution. Mr Katumbi has been nominated by seven opposition parties to be their presidential candidate in the elections expected in November. Mr Kabila took power in 2001 after his father Laurent Kabila was assassinated. Africa Live: BBC news updates Mr Kabila has won two disputed elections since he took power in 2001, and is constitutionally barred from contesting the poll. Violent protests erupted last year over fears that President Joseph Kabila was trying to delay polls. If Mr Kabila stands down in December he \\"will go out as a great president who will be praised everywhere,\\" Mr Katumbi told the BBC. Moise Katumbi was governor of the south-eastern Katanga province for almost a decade. In September last year he broke ties with the ruling party when he accused President Kabila, his former ally, of wanting to cling to power. His popularity is partly down to his job as the president of a great source of Congolese pride - football club TP Mazembe. They are Africa's reigning football champions, having won the African Champions League for the fifth time in November. Could Moise Katumbi become president? Kabila unlikely to give up power Mr Katumbi thanked the seven parties whic nominated him on Wednesday as their presidential candidate. But he didn't confirm whether he would accept the nomination, instead saying he wants even more opposition parties to join the coalition. \\"For now, I am continuing my consultations here in Europe for the unity of the opposition. \\"I am also consulting all the forces to have a single opposition candidate,\\" he said.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What's the nickname of the lady who fights beside her estranged husband?, using the article: Cattle, timber and mining baron George Washington \\"G.W.\\" McLintock is living the single life on his ranch. He is estranged from wife Katherine, who left him two years before, suspecting him of adultery. She has been living the society life back East while their daughter Rebeeca (whom G.W. calls \\"Becky\\") (Stefanie Powers) is completing her college degree. Following a meeting with a group of homesteaders whom he cautions against trying to farm on the Mesa Verde: \\"God made that land for the buffalo. It serves pretty well for cattle. But it hates the plow! And even the government should know you can't farm six thousand feet above sea level!\\" He hires one of them, attractive widow Louise Warren, as his cook and housekeeper. G.W. welcomes both her and her two children into his home, including grown son Dev, who is handy with his fists, good with cattle, and is an excellent chess player, who had to leave Purdue University on account of his father's death. Katherine (a.k.a. Katie), returns to the town of McLintock, seeking a divorce from G.W. He declines to give her one, having no idea why she has been so angry with him and why she moved out two years ago. Following a misunderstanding which leads to a Comanche subchief nearly being lynched by a hotheaded settler father who believes his daughter has been kidnapped, there is a gigantic brawl at the mud slide by one of McLintock's mines. Significantly, Katherine is in there swinging on her estranged husband's side as the local Indians watch the white folks make fools of themselves., what would be the answer ?

On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. I am facing a new situation today: Nicholas works in pest control, and needs to have a steady supply of nitrogen gas for his tools. He always keeps a closed container of nitrogen gas in his freezer, where the temperature is very low. Nicholas's neighbor, Justin, likes to grill in his backyard. Justin, therefore, always keeps a closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is high. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: The container of which gas will have lower pressure inside it? A:","completion":"The container of nitrogen gas will have lower pressure inside it. This is because the nitrogen gas is stored in Nicholas's freezer at a very low temperature, and according to the background article, decreasing the temperature of an enclosed gas results in a decrease in pressure. In contrast, Justin's container of propane gas is stored outside where the temperature is high, leading to a higher pressure inside the container."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
